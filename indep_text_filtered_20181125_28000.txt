CHRISTMAS TREE BUYING GUIDE: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW

There are a huge variety of Christmas trees on the market – half-trees anyone? – but with our comprehensive buying guide, you’ll easily find the right one for you.

Should you buy an artificial or a real tree?

Evergreen fir trees have been used for thousands of years by both pagans and Christians to symbolise living nature in the dead months of winter. So while your white plastic tree won’t cut it in maintaining this tradition, for practical reasons of cost, convenience and comfort, many people prefer to opt for artificial. You’ll miss out on the natural pine scent but also on hoovering up the needles. However, by arming yourself with our top tips you can avoid the real tree pitfalls.

What’s the best type of real tree to buy?

Choose between spruces, firs and pines. The Norway Spruce is traditionally a popular choice with its rich green colour and pine fragrance. The Blue Spruce will hold its needles better but can be pricklier. The Nordmann Fir is a more expensive option but looks lush and luxurious and has good needle retention. The Fraser fir has a similar appearance to the Norway Spruce but is slightly narrower, making it a good space-saving option, as is the Serbian Spruce, with a slender shape and thin branches. The Scots pine, Scotland’s national tree, has strong branches, great for supporting heavy decorations.

Where should you shop, and can you buy it online?

You’ll find the biggest selection of artificial trees online, everything from budget starter models to pre-decorated, pre-lit, snow-dusted, upside-down and easy-assemble pop-up designs in a range of colours and styles. Space-saving options include half trees, which sit flush to the wall, corner trees and twigs for compact spaces.

But when it comes to real trees, it is advisable to buy from a local grower and see before you buy. The British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA) has a tool that allows you to search Christmas tree sellers across the UK, or just visit your local garden centre, nursery or DIY store. Most retailers offer a delivery service, many will also allow you to reserve online for collection.

When should you buy it?

Etiquette and practicalities come into play here and you may be the talk of your neighbourhood if your tree goes up in mid-November. Traditionally, trees were not displayed until Christmas Eve, but conventional wisdom suggests the first or second weekend in December is ideal.

The BCTGA says it’s fine to buy your tree from December 1, as the expected life of a cut tree is about four weeks, though some may last six. If you want an early tree, a Nordmann Fir is the best option with its non-drop needles.

Needlefresh, one of the largest suppliers of real trees in the UK, reminds us that British trees enjoy regular rainfall and will be fresher when they reach their destination.

What should you look for when buying a real tree?

It’s very important to check your tree for freshness before you buy – give it a shake or drop it from a few inches above the ground to ensure that most of its needles stay intact. If more than a few needles drop off, it has not been freshly cut and won’t last as long.

A Norway Spruce should have a pleasant pine scent but bear in mind that a Nordmann Fir will have a subtler fragrance – this does NOT mean that it’s less fresh.

Take a tape measure with you when you shop, having measured the height of your ceiling and floor space before you go. Allow enough space between ceiling and top of the tree for a tree topper and enough space at the bottom for the stand. Needlefresh recommends allowing about 40cm between tree topper and ceiling and about 15cm for the stand.

Trees that are pre-netted may not last as long because the net can strain the branches, causing dehydration. Remember, that net can also hide a multitude of sins, so choose one that you can examine freely and only net it to transport home.

How can you buy eco-friendly?

Real trees have much lower carbon footprints than artificial Christmas trees. The Carbon Trust estimates that a 2-metre artificial tree has a carbon footprint that is more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill, and more than ten times that of real trees that are burnt.

Horticulture Week points to the environmental benefits that have driven a surge in pot-grown Christmas trees in recent years. These trees have been grown for at least one season in their pots and normally grow to about three feet tall. The BCTGA advises planting these trees out after Christmas for best results. Alternatively, they can be left to grow in their pots but re-potting to a bigger pot will give better results.

How should you care for your tree to keep it looking fresh?

After purchase, leave your tree outside in a sheltered place, preferably standing in water, until you are ready to decorate it.

Mount the tree in a stand with space for water or a bucket filled with small rocks. If using a stand, ensure it fits your tree and avoid paring the trunk to fit. The team at RealChristmasTrees.org advise that the outer layers of wood are the most efficient in taking up water and should not be removed.

The Royal Horticultural Society recommends cutting about an inch off the bottom of the trunk to help it absorb moisture. Water your tree regularly – it will absorb much more water than you think so check it daily over the festive period.

Potted trees should be kept in a cool room and brought indoors as late as possible – the weekend before Christmas is ideal says the RHS.

And remember, the cooler the room, the better your tree will like it. At the very least avoid placing it right beside a radiator or fire.

Caring for your tree: common myths

Don’t cut the tree base at an angle, in a V-shape or drill a hole in the base, say the experts at Needlefresh. Contrary to popular opinion, these methods do not help water absorption and they may make the tree unstable.

Don’t add anything to the water - sugar, soft drinks, floral or tree preservatives will not aid freshness.

What decorations should you avoid?

Heavy decorations on a slender tree will drag down the branches and you should also avoid low-hanging baubles in a house with pets or babies, as inquisitive hands or paws may topple the tree.

How much will it cost?

Expect to pay around £50 for a full-size real tree, though prices vary around the country. Remember if a real tree is priced exceptionally low, it’s unlikely to be top quality and you may find it drooping by Christmas.

10 BEST CHRISTMAS CRACKERS FOR 2018

As with so many of our Christmas traditions, crackers date back to Victorian times.

They originated in the UK and started life as sweets and riddles wrapped in pretty paper. But despite being based on a popular French concept, nobody over here liked them very much – until the sweet maker came up with the idea of opening them with a ‘bang’, inspired by the crackles and sparks coming from his fire as he mulled over the problem one night.

Crackers were born and the rest is history – a fact to impress your guests with when you’re pulling them over dinner come Christmas Day.

We’ve rounded up our top picks from this year’s selection.

George Premium Crackers Silver Star Crackers, pack of 8: £5, Asda

Snap factor: Strong

Contents: Hat, joke, gift

We like: Great contents for a purse-friendly price

Let’s declare it straight off, the George Premium Crackers are by far and away the best value crackers that we've tested. In fact, even without the extremely budget-friendly price point, they would still be a great buy.

Substantially sized in pretty silver packaging and eight crackers to a box, useful gifts include post-dinner games and toys, nail clippers, mirrors, picture frames and mini screwdriver sets. There’s also a nice quality foil hat and a whole ‘entertainment scroll’, featuring excellent jokes, an anagram, quiz and parlour game, so no need to worry about your guests post-dinner, just put your feet up and let the entertainment begin.

Buy now (available early November)

Luxury Holly Christmas Crackers, pack of 6: £19.99, Lakeland

Snap factor: Strong

Contents: Hat, joke, gift

We like: The trivia information, perfect for post-dinner debates

This is one of the most beautifully packaged and presented cracker sets we’ve seen on the market this year, priced reasonably for this level of luxury. We enjoyed the loud snap and practical, high quality gifts – these are items to use, not bin, including keyrings, photo frames, luggage tags and fun mini games such as skittles and golf.

Any downsides? Unfortunately, the hat is paper rather than foil, which lets down the luxury appeal somewhat, but the jokes are original and funny. And the trivia information kicked off a great discussion around the testing table, the perfect post-dinner debate starter.

Buy now

Musical Hand Bell Crackers, pack of 8: £24.99, Dogs Trust

Snap factor: Strong

Contents: Hat, bell, joke, numbered badge

We like: The fact these crackers play a tune

The box is big, the crackers are handmade and luxurious, this is something quite special and will bring a very harmonious touch to your post-dinner celebrations. Looking at the creative musical design, you may think these are no ordinary crackers - and you are right.

Inside each cracker is a colourful bell and once all of the bells have been allocated, each player is given a badge with a number. The chosen ‘conductor’ directs the bell ringing from a numbered music sheet, pointing at each person in turn (depending on their number) to ring their bell. The ensuing fun – and occasional chaos – will end your Christmas dinner on a lively note and you’re supporting the great work of the Dogs Trust as well. It’s not just for Christmas, you know…

Make Your Own Santa and Reindeer Cracker Kit, pack of 6: £4, Hobbycraft

Snap factor: Good

Contents: Everything you need to make your own crackers – minus the gifts

We like: The fact we can smugly announce we made these

Put the creative back in Christmas and make your own crackers this year.

Hobbycraft has made it easy with this DIY kit, which includes six crackers in two designs that are very easy to assemble, six jokes, six hats, six snaps and 12 tying ribbons. The only downside is that you’ll have to provide your own gifts – but at £4 for the entire kit, it’s a steal at the price. And think of all the fun you’ll have getting them ready in the run up to Christmas Day!

Buy now

Miniature Gold Leaf Christmas Crackers, pack of 6: £16, Fortnum & Mason

Snap factor: Medium

Contents: Hat, entertaining scroll, gift

We like: The gold glitz factor

It’s a medium snap, but in fairness these are mini crackers and the presentation more than makes up for it, with a beautifully shimmering gold design that will dress up your dinner table with some festive glitz. Ribbons decorated with bells on each cracker are a very nice touch for a bit of a jingle as you pull – our testers put the ribboned bells to good use as wine glass ornaments afterwards.

Inside is a foil hat and an ‘entertaining scroll’ with some very traditional – OK, slightly cheesy – jokes. The mini gifts are quite practical and include golf tees, a measuring tape, dice, marbles and a tiny screwdriver set.

Buy now

Father Christmas Six Luxury Crackers, pack of 6: £35, Selfridges

Snap factor: Strong

Contents: Hat, joke, gift

We like: The eye-catching design, great for kids

These crackers really look the part and will delight children big and small on Christmas Day. Weighty and substantial, they have an excellent snap but – what a surprise – a paper hat, which sits very limply alongside the triumphant foil crowns of most of the other crackers we tested.

Good jokes, though – funny and festive – and quite useful gifts, including crayons, chalks, pencil sharpener, origami set, marbles and a ‘Santa’s Little Helper’ badge. However, taking everything into consideration, it’s quite a steep price for what you get.

Buy now

Mini Christmas Crackers, pack of 10: £17, Hotel Chocolat

Snap factor: None

Contents: Chocolate

We like: The fact it doubles as a place setting

OK, so you might not be actually pulling these around the table, but they will look very pretty at each place setting and – added bonus – have a space on the back to write each guest’s name to double as placeholders.

Each one contains a Hotel Chocolat chocolate – some of the tastiest chocolate on the market we believe – from a selection of five including pralines, luscious caramels, nutty treats and billionaire’s shortbread. So there is a surprise involved in each opening – which one will you get?

You could also hang these on the tree in the lead-up to Christmas Day as a tasty festive decoration.

Buy now

Christmas Tree Shaped crackers, pack of 6: £20, Marks & Spencer

Snap factor: Medium

Contents: Hat, joke, gift

We like: The eye-catching design

And now for something completely different. Yes, it is a cracker that two people can pull – one holds the base, the other pulls the ribbon at the top – but it’s difficult to co-ordinate and get a strong snap and so maybe this is the ideal ‘go-it-alone’ cracker.

It will sit beautifully at each place setting, each guest can pull their own (chortle) and everyone gets a gift. Plus, the packaging folds back into its original tree shape afterwards so your place setting is still beautifully decorated instead of being heaped in shredded foil and cardboard.

Gifts are high quality and practical – things like bookmarks and designer paper clips - and the jokes made us laugh out loud. It could be a trend of the future.

Buy now

Join Hands Gift Cracker, single cracker: £20, Crabtree & Evelyn

Snap factor: None

Contents: Three hand creams

We like: The beautiful pastel product packaging

Pretty packaging, with an easy twist-open cracker box, this would make a pretty gift and is particularly ideal for a gardener. Because inside are three 25ml hand therapy hand creams from Crabtree & Evelyn, including hydrating Rosewater and Pink Peppercorn, La Source ultra-moisturising cream and Gardeners hand cream, with ingredients including cucumber, rosemary, rosewater and seaweed.

Buy now

The Icons Cracker, single cracker: £20, Molton Brown

Snap factor: None

Contents: Four bath and shower gels

We like: The iconic fragrances, perfect for a dressed-up bathroom this Christmas

Tastefully packaged, this would make a great gift though you probably won’t be pulling it around the table after dinner. Inside you’ll find four iconic 50ml Molton Brown bath and shower gels, including Rosa, Tobacco, Fiery Pink Pepper and Black Pepper, merging floral, spicy and woody notes. It makes a great gift – though you might just want to keep it for yourself…

Buy now

The Verdict: Best Christmas crackers

For value for money, cracker size and festive glitz, George at Asda is the clear winner this year.

But for a wonderfully creative musical alternative to the usual cracker experience, that will also help save the lives of stray and abandoned dogs, opt for the Dogs Trust Musical Hand Bell Crackers.

We can’t resist giving a shout-out to Marks & Spencer for its very inventive and fun Christmas tree crackers.

10 BEST TV STANDS

As the average price of a TV continues to fall, more of us are tempted by supersized screens that bring the drama of a good film or football match into ourtee home. The trick to getting a big screen to blend in with your interior is to choose a suitable stand. The most common widths are between 120cm (suitable for 55 inch screens) and 160cm (65 inch screens). Check the weight it can take, considering the stand should also hold all the peripheral gadgets that go with modern TVs: DVD players, consoles and set top boxes, too.

In small spaces, it’s best to go with something visually lightweight like glass or metal. The other tactic is to go for something that looks like a long and slim sideboard and can accommodate books, picture frames and ornaments as well as the screen. A good TV stand has at least basic cable management built in to stop things getting in a tangle, and closed cabinet-style designs should ideally have integrated ventilation, too.

Techlink Panorama PM160 TV Stand: £299, John Lewis & Partners

This stand is for the gadget lover who has it all. Four shelves can hold DVD player, console, Blu-ray and set-top box all at once. The two drop-down glass doors are remote-friendly too. There’s individual cable management from each compartment to stop things getting in a tangle and the unit has air vents for keeping your tech cool. The unit has a light oak veneered top panel, chrome-plated legs, and is made for TVs up to 80 inches.

Buy now

Long Island TV Unit: £229, Maisons Du Monde

The industrial look of this well-priced unit by Maisons du Monde is down to a combination of black metal frame and solid fir wood. The wood is bleached to a light colour which makes the unit less imposing for neutral interiors. The two drawers provide useful storage. If you love clean lines, however, beware the open shelf which leaves trailing TV cables exposed.

Buy now

Hannah Wide TV Unit: £139, Very

One for more traditional interiors, the Hannah unit from Very combines a chunky “oak-effect” top with surfaces painted sage green. There are two side cupboards for DVDs and a central shelf for a player. The shelf has a back with a circular hole for cables making them easy to tidy away. At 160cm wide, the unit fits TVs up to 66 inches. There is a matching range of lounge furniture.

Buy now

Swoon Editions Watson Media Unit: £299, Swoon Editions

Harking back to the sideboard’s heyday, this mid-century style unit from Swoon Editions has a retro feel. It has a rosewood frame with engineered back panel, and a sliding front panel for storing DVDs and other media behind. This one’s a vibrant orange, but there is a white and natural wood version too.

Ikea Gettorp TV Bench: £85, Ikea

Ikea’s bench has slick looks and is made of tempered glass and black metal. There’s a cable management tray built in under the top for keeping things tidy.

There’s a white and aluminium version too.

Buy now

John Lewis Dante TV Stand: £599, John Lewis

The Dante stand is a 160cm-wide luxury TV unit in lacquered MDF and made in Italy. The unit has a matte finish, and the front has a wave embossed effect.

There are holes in the back panel for cables and ventilation slots in the base to keep your tech cool.

Buy now

Habitat Max TV Stand: £276.50, Habitat

If you hate the sight of modern tech and cables, Habitat’s Max TV stand has a clever design solution. DVD players, set-top boxes – pretty much everything you can point a remote to – can hide away behind slatted sliding doors that allow infrared signals to pass through when closed. Made of oiled oak and veneer, and 160cm wide, this piece has the feel of solid furniture rather than tech accessory. Inside the stand is split into a large compartment and a smaller drawer for remotes.

Buy now

TTAP VISION 1200 Stand: £99.95, Richer Sounds

This fuss-free budget stand has two tempered glass shelves and supports finished with walnut veneer. It’s visually light, and better for small spaces which could look cluttered by more solid furniture. This one suits TVs up to 60 inches wide. The top shelf is strong (it can hold 65kg in weight) and roomy enough for a sound bar too. The bottom shelf has space for a couple of consoles or other components side-by-side. There’s a reinforced hole at the back for gathering cables neatly. Self-assembly is required.

Buy now

Oakland Glazed TV Stand: £399, Cotswold & Company

This rustic oak TV stand makes a lovely piece of furniture in itself. It’s been hand-finished with wax and sealed with clear lacquer to give it a quality finish that extends the life of the wood and adds to the robustness of this piece.

Buy now

Habitat Gala Tempered Glass TV Stand: £280, Habitat

Habitat’s Gala is a super contemporary stand made of tough tempered glass that bends elegantly. The 140cm-wide unit has just one long shelf and connections brushed aluminium. It’s a good choice if you like minimal design and don’t want the TV to be the main feature of the room. The striking looks of glass furniture do require extra care: use place mats under hot and cold drinks, and avoid cleaning products that may scratch.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best TV stands

Wide enough for TVs up to 80 inches and very reasonably-priced at £299 is Techlink’s Panorama stand from John Lewis. It puts practicality first with lots of compartments, good cable management and ventilation.

11 BEST PANETTONES

Originating in Milan, these festive bakes are now so popular here in the UK that it simply wouldn’t feel like Christmas without the fragrant waft of candied fruit filling the air.

Light and fluffy, the versatile panettone is delicious enjoyed for breakfast or elevenses, dessert or a mid-afternoon snack to get you through the 4pm slump. In fact, we can’t think of a time it wouldn’t be appropriate for a slice.

Traditionally made with butter and filled with citrus peel, sultanas and raisins, these days you’ll find plenty of chocolate or booze soaked variations as well.

Keep a pre-wrapped style on stand-by for those inevitable Christmas guests that are bound to pop round - a panettone makes for an effortless gift that’s always well-received.

So whether you eat yours toasted, or straight out of the pack, these are our favourite panettones for Christmas 2018.

Asda Extra Special Italian Panettone 500g: £7, Asda

This low-rise panettone is a great value option, if you’re looking for a traditional bake. Soft and squidgy, the sultanas and candied fruit was evenly dispersed and finished with a lovely brioche-style glaze.

It comes in an air-tight gold tin which kept it nice and fresh – not that it hung around for that long.

Buy now

M&S Panettone Classico 1kg: £15, Marks & Spencer

Sprinkled with a snow-like layer of crunchy sugar nibs and finely ground hazelnuts, this sweet bread is filled with the all the traditional fruit – sultanas, candied orange peel, juicy sultanas – that you’d expect to find.

The topping does make this particularly sweet so bear that in mind when cutting a slice. Presented in a hard orange and gold box, this remains a good value gift to keep on stand-by for surprise visitors.

Buy now

The Red Beetle Traditional Panettone di Milano 1KG: £23, The Red Beetle

The Red Beetle is a wonderful online deli which brings the absolute best of Italian food straight to your door. This Milanese panettone is a prime example.

Made by the Vergani family, using a recipe dating back to 1944, this is everything you’d want from a traditional bake.

Sweetened with Tuscan honey and laced with Sicilian candied orange peel, we loved the delicate vanilla flavour in the light dough.

Buy now

Ginettone by Gin Mare 500g: £22, Harvey Nichols

If super sweet puddings aren’t your thing, you might be interested in this more savoury version from Gin Mare.

The Mediterranean gin brand have teamed up with Italian chef Theo Randall who played around with the brands botanicals – think juniper, rosemary, orange and olives - and infused them in a panettone.

The bread itself is sweet, but there’s a saltiness from the gin-soaked olives with every bite. Sounds strange but it really works, and will certainly be a conversation starter.

Available exclusively at Harvey Nichols, there are only 500 available.

Buy now (available from Nov 8)

Vallebona Traditional Panettone with PomPom 10kg: £270, Vallebona

Hands down the biggest panettone we’ve ever seen, this whopper weighs in at an impressive (or frightening!) 10kgs. Vallebona source their panettone from a small family run business in Turin, who have been making this very same recipes for years.

Rich and buttery, this Christmas treat comes wrapped in red tissue paper and finished with a big red woolly pompom. If you’re looking to send a corporate gift, this will surely go down a treat.

Buy now

Perbellini Chocolate Peanut Butter Panettone made with Reese's 1kg: £27.99, Selfridges

Every year Selfridges put their own stamp on the festive bake, and this collaboration with Italian family-run bakery, Perbellini is no exception.

They’ve got rid of the fruity filing and replaced it with small Reese’s Pieces chocolate chunks. If you’re not familiar with the American import, you’ll find a blend of milk chocolate and peanut butter laced throughout.

It can be eaten straight out of the pack but warming it up will melt the chocolate slightly, making for a very decadent afternoon treat.

You’d be forgiven for walking straight past this one as it’s been wrapped in a rather sophisticated brown paper package, which mimics the restrained size of the peanut butter pieces inside.

We thought this would be a real sweet-bomb but actually it was deliciously balanced.

Buy now

Morrisons The Best Brandy, Chocolate & Orange Panettone 750g: £8, Morrisons

Chocolate orange is a well-known winning flavour combo, but adding a generous glug of brandy only made things better.

We smelt the booze straight out of the pack, which has been laced throughout the dough. Covered in a thick layer of orange flavoured chocolate, it’s also studded with chocolate chips for good measure.

Wrapped up with a big bow, this gift-able bake is best served for dessert.

Buy now (available from Nov 5)

Tesco Finest Orange Liqueur & Chocolate Panettone 750g: £10, Tesco

Another chocolate orange creation, but this time with the distinctive flavours of orange liqueur from the infused Grand Marnier®. A small slice should suffice as the rich buttery dough, combined with chocolate and a sprinkling of hazelnuts makes this deliciously sweet. Try it with an espresso for an after dinner treat.

Buy now

Crosta & Mollica Mini Panettone Cherry & Sultana 80g: £1.50, Ocado

Sometimes the mini panettones can be a little dry, but not with Crosta & Mollica’s petit version. Individually wrapped and stuffed with juicy sticky black cherry and dotted with sultanas, this is a very decent portion for one person.

We treated ourselves to this at breakfast time with a cup of tea, and we suggest you do the same.

Buy now

Arden & Amici Low Bake Tipsy Tiramisu Panettone 750g: £10, Tesco

Just in case there was any doubt that panettone was an Italian invention, Arden & Amici has added the wonderful flavours of tiramisu to the mix.

It’s created with a special mother dough starter which dates back generations, but is given a delicious twist with rich coffee syrup and chocolate topping.

They recommend serving it with a large dollop of creamy mascarpone and a splash of amaretto which sounds absolutely divine.

Buy now

Waitrose Cranberry Panettone 750 g : £12, Waitrose

Imagine a cross between mulled wine and Christmas cake and you’re halfway to understanding the delicious festive flavours of this panettone from Waitrose.

Light and sweet and filled with red fruit, it smelt incredible. We liked the combination of dried cranberries, cherries and candied clementine for something a little different to the traditional sultanas.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best panettones

If you’re looking for a traditional festive bake, we think Asda's extra special version represents great value.

However, Selfridges' Reese's Pieces flecked version was our favourite of the chocolate varieties.

8 BEST SKI AND SNOWBOARD GOGGLES

Heading for the mountains this winter? A pair of snowsports goggles are a must. Goggles protect your peepers from wind, cold and blowing snow and are useful in all conditions – they work both to shield your eyes from the harsh glare of sun on the white stuff and to improve visibility in low, flat light or in a whiteout.

The main factor to keep in mind when buying a pair of goggles for skiing or snowboarding is which colour lens to go for. Generally, different coloured lenses are best suited to different conditions. As a rough rule, yellow lenses are good for cloudy days, whilst dark colours and polarised lenses work best on sunny days. Lenses usually come with a VLT (visual light transmission) rating, and the lower the number, the better it’ll be suited to bright sunshine.

For example, a lens with VLT of 40 per cent will be effective for low light, whilst one with 9 per cent VLT is ideal for bright bluebird days. You can also buy goggle frames that allow you to pop in different lenses when conditions change – if you go for these, check that the lenses stay snug and don’t slip out.

Make sure that the lenses you buy offer protection from both UVA and UVB light – most models these days offer 100 per cent protection. Look for goggles constructed with double lenses (this helps avoid fogging up) and lenses treated with anti-fog and anti-scratch technologies to keep them clear. Lenses are easy to scratch – only clean them with the cloth they come with and keep them in a soft bag or hard case when you aren’t wearing them.

There’s a trend for sporting big, wraparound goggles that offer uninterrupted peripheral vision. These spherical lenses tend to be more expensive but we reckon they’re worth an extra spend for the improved vision you end up with, especially if you’re planning long days on the pistes. Check the strap on the model you buy is easy to adjust, and fits snugly over both a beanie hat and your helmet (some helmets have clips you can pop a goggle strap into).

When worn with a helmet, your goggles should sit flush to the helmet lid, so that there’s no gap on your forehead (otherwise you can end up with an oddly placed suntan strip). Try out goggles against your face and check that the foam-clad frame feels light and comfortable around your eyes.

Goggles tend to be unisex, but smaller female-specific fits are good if you find regular models tend to feel enormous on your face. If you need to wear glasses, plump for goggles designed to fit over your frames. We’ve included goggles to fit most budgets, but we would say that you get what you pay for with lenses, they are an investment worth making.

Dragon Alliance PXV Galaxy Goggles: £160, Dragon Alliance

We like a lot of things about the PXV, but then perhaps we should for the upper-end price. It sits beautifully on the face – this is a goggle you’ll quickly forget you’re wearing, thanks to the perfect amount of foam on the frame. The wide lens is anti-fog, even if you’re skiing at speed, due to good vents all around the lens. The lenses are quick to pop in and out if you want to swap to a different hue, and two are included so you’ll be ready for most weather conditions.

Buy now

Oakley Fall Line: £170, Oakley

Oakleys may not come cheap, but they always offer great performance. The Fall Lines are bulky on the face to due to a very thick foam frame, but the plus side to that is great comfort and breathability, even if you’re out first lift to last lift. The wide straps sport the classic Oakley ‘O’ and are easy to wear and adjust. We tested the Sapphire Iridium lens, a good all-rounder choice for sun and clouds with a VLT light transmission of 13 per cent, and plenty of other colourways are available.

Adidas Progressor Splite Goggles: £175, Adidas Sport Eyewear

Adidas are rightly proud of how light and portable the brand new Splite is – it weighs a touch under 80g and fits easily into a jacket pocket. As a result the lenses look rather alarmingly flimsy and cheap at first glance, but once on they feel great, with a flex that means they fit nicely on the face. The purple-tinted lenses offer great clarity and true-to-life colours, but the range of vision isn’t the biggest.

Buy now

Mountain Warehouse Polarised Extreme Goggles: £79.99, Mountain Warehouse

One of the best goggles we tested, considering the very decent price, the Polarised Extreme is indeed polarised, cutting the glare from sunshine well and protective from UV rays. The lens has a nice flex but still feels tough and hardy, and the range of vision is decent. Great value for money for beginners or seasonnaires, and they look good on, too – you get a lot of bang for your buck here.

Buy now

Bollé Nevada Goggles: £74.99, RX Sports

Another nice workhorse goggle for well under £100, the Nevada sports a wide frame that will fit most faces. There’s a good field of vision to the sides, but the chunky foam frame does sit quite high on nose and cheeks. The strap is great, and will stay put on a helmet or hat. This orange lens offers 22 per cent VLT, a good all-rounder for sun and cloud, but if you can afford to, we’d pick Bolle’s Phantom lens which adapts to changing light conditions.

Buy now

Cébé Fanatic Goggles: £29.06, Outdoor GB

Our pocket-friendly pick of the season, the excellently priced Fanatic is actually better suited to newbies than snowsports fanatics. The lens is on the small side (good for smaller faces) and is anti-fog and anti-scratch, ideal if you’re clumsy. The comfortable foam frame is lined with fleece for comfort, and there’s an easy-to-adjust strap. The Fanatic doesn’t have the most modern looks, but if you’re off for lessons or are on a budget it’s a very decent choice.

Buy now

Sungod Vanguard Goggles: £110, Sungod

We’ve always rated Sungod’s popular Revolts goggles highly, so we were pleased to try their latest incarnation for winter 2018-19, the Vanguard. It sports a massive lens that looks rather big on the face but offers an excellent field of vision. The strap is comfortable and wide, and the frame felt more durable than others on test. This is a tough all-rounder, ideal for seasonnaires or anyone working in a mountain resort who needs a goggle for reliable, regular use. Plus, they’re covered by a lifetime guarantee, and can be returned for repair from anywhere in the world.

Buy now

Roxy Rockferry Goggles: £95, Roxy

Our top pick for smaller faces and design fans alike, the good looking Rockferrys are simple, effective goggles. The smaller frame does still offer a good wide field of vision, and there’s a lens colour in the collection to suit any weather. Wide straps, all in bright, eye-catching designs, sit nicely over hats and helmets alike. A good no-fuss option for decent UV protection and plenty of style points.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best ski and snowboard goggles

The Dragon Alliance PXV is an all-round high performer, and we rate the Adidas Progressor Splice if you like a lightweight goggle. Want to spend under £100? Pick the Mountain Warehouse Polarised Extreme.

11 BEST GIFTS FOR 6-YEAR-OLDS

At six years old, a child is no longer a ‘little kid,’ but nor are they – in most cases – too ‘cool’ to play, explore and learn. Finding a present that is neither too babyish nor too advanced for them is not always easy. For this guide, we’ve gathered together a range of options that we think are great value at a range of price points. Our selection includes big-ticket birthday or Christmas present ideas for relatives to purchase and some smaller items for friends. We’ve looked for things that will get them moving, learning or imagining, as well as a couple of gift-worthy accessories.

Lego Large Creative Brick Box: £34.99, Smyths Toys

By the age of six, children have probably dabbled with mini Lego sets and grown out of Duplo. Time, therefore, to invest in a decent haul of straight-up bricks and get creative. This set contains a whopping 790 pieces, in a range of colours, and includes base pieces and wheels. Our testers spent many happy hours making all sorts of slightly bonkers creations. Parents will likely be most happy about the sturdy, lidded box.

Buy now

Snazaroo Brush Pens: £8.95 , Amazon

These ingenious new products from face paint-makers Snazaroo mean that children can draw directly on each other – or on dad – without the mess of brushes and small pots of water. They come in five differently-themed packs of three, for example pink, purple and silver for butterflies and fairies, or a yellow, green and brown ‘jungle pack’ for creating lions and other fearsome beasts.

Buy now

Carrera Cosmos Bike: £164, Halfords

Most six-year-olds can ride without stabilisers – or are heading that way – and at this age, a good bike becomes a must-have for whizzing around the park or getting to and from school in style. Our tester was delighted with this light and manoeuvrable yet reassuringly sturdy model, which can be fitted with stabilisers if they are still needed.

Buy now

Knowledge Encyclopedia Animal!: £10.69, Abe Books

This is a gorgeous book, densely packed with almost 300 pages of colour photographs and facts that curious nature-lovers will aborb like a sponge. A fantastic-value option for a classmate’s party, and a tome that will remain on bookshelves for years.

Buy now

National Geographic Kids Magazine Subscription: £37, National Geographic

Plenty of six-year-olds are drowning in toys that they don’t use, and buying them more stuff can feel like a gratuitous waste of money and precious house space. NG Kids is a great alternative. With an annual gift subscription, the recipient gets a monthly copy of this informative and fun magazine, full of pictures, info and puzzles about wildlife, history and science; a cartoon about the Terracotta Warriors was a particular favourite with our testers. They also get the excitement of getting their very own post; no small thrill in our house. Be warned; the magazine does contain adverts, though they are mostly for benign things like books.

Buy now

Scrabble Junior: £14.99, Amazon

This kid-friendly version of the classic board game has two levels; one that requires players to complete particular words such as "lion" and "cake" with the help of picture clues, and a more advanced version on the other side that gets them coming up with their own words. A pleasing combination of fun and educational brownie-points.

Buy now

Flik Flak Amazoonia W atch: £26, Swatch

Flik Flak watches from Swatch have washable straps that fit even the tiniest wrists, allowing wearers to show off and practise their new time-telling skills as well as their latest accessory. They come in a range of jaunty designs, many of which are gender neutral. We like this jungle-themed Amazoonia version. Comes with a two year warranty.

Buy now

Glow In The Dark Stars Box: £4.95, Rex London

This is an excellent, cheap option for that hundredth birthday party your child has been invited to. Containing 30 stars that can be used to light up a bedroom ceiling or decorate notebooks or craft boxes. The double-sided sticky fixers are a little bit fiddly, so your child might need a bit of help. The set could also be broken up and divided between siblings or party bags.

Buy now

Worst Witch Box Set: £7.99, The Book People

Jill Murphy’s classic tales about the misadventures of Mildred Hubble have become a hit with a new generation thanks to CBBC’s recent adaptation. With this bargainous box set you have a great-value birthday party present, and a chance to capitalise on that TV-based interest to get them listening to, and in due course reading, some fantastic books.

Buy now

Fire HD 10 Kids Edition Tablet: £199.99, Amazon

Not cheap, but certainly cheaper than some other leading tablet brands, and all the young Fire owners we quizzed love and regularly use them. This latest version is perfect for on the move but also, with a 10.1” HD screen, which is considerably bigger than previous versions, it is big enough for game-playing at TV watching at home. It comes with a sturdy case and Amazon’s guarantee that if your child breaks their device within two years, they will replace it.

There is a fair amount of nonsense available as part of the Fire for Kids Unlimited package, which comes free for the first year, but there’s plenty of good stuff – we like the Gruffalo app – and the option for parental controls. This comes, a little depressingly, in pink and blue.

Buy now

Wolf Slippers: From £18, Boden

These slippers are obscenely soft as well as being very warm and very good fun, with their lupine fangs and beady eyes. They’ve got ‘present from doting grandparent’ written all over them, and might just persuade the recipient to actually wear something warm on their feet over winter.

Buy now

Verdict: Best gifts for six year olds

A good quality bike is a great investment if you’re splashing the cash, and the face paint pens would be a brilliant smaller gift or birthday party offering. However, for all round value, longevity and child-occupying power, our Best Buy is the Lego Large Creative Brick Box.

7 BEST NIGHT CREAMS FOR YOUR 20S

Writing about night creams is a bit like writing about food. Words like “sumptuous”, “souffle” and “moist” spring to mind with almost every product, but then again, maybe that’s the point. Like good food, beauty products are an indulgence. Scrubs, masks, oils… spending money on these items will always feel like a treat, but night creams are at the upper echelons of any woman’s regime. Because they’re not quite as essential as, say, a cleanser, there’s a certain kind of woman who uses night creams: one who is astute and takes great care over their appearance. They probably also have a 20-minute pre-bedtime beauty routine. In the process of testing these products, I have become that woman. But night creams are expensive.

Why should women in their 20s be making such steep investments when their skin is supple and smooth? The answer is simple: so that it stays supple and smooth. The earlier you start using these products, the longer you can keep your skin in tip top condition. Forward-planning aside, there’s something special about coming home after a long day at the office, washing your face, creaming up, and going to sleep all dewy-skinned knowing that you might wake up looking like royalty.

Read on for our roundup of the best night creams for women in their 20s.

Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Night Cream: £100, Charlotte Tilbury

If the idea of applying thick cream to your face does not appeal, do not buy this product. However, we really enjoyed the rich, sticky texture. Not only did it make us feel like it was really doing magical things to our face, as the name suggests, but it also felt like we were getting our money’s worth. It has a medicinal smell, like something you’d pick up in a 1940s apothecary. Again, this didn't put us off, but seduced us into thinking this product must be doing something right: something scientific. Yes, it’s expensive, but welcome to the world of night creams: no one told you this would be easy, or cheap.

Buy now

Clarins Multi-Active Nuit Revitalising Night Cream: £38.70, Escentual.com

This is one of those creams that feels good the moment you apply it. Maybe it’s the opulent botanical scent, the royal blue shade of its pot, or the fact that ours grandmothers' entire bathrooms are a cornucopia of Clarins, but something about this cream makes it feel far too grownup for a woman in their 20s. This might be because it tours itself as targeting fine lines, which are few and far between on the typical twentysomething face.

That being said, it felt very good on my skin and it’s made with golden poppy extract, which helps to revitalise a sleep-deprived complexion. As for its texture, it was neither too thin nor too heavy-duty. This product is a strong and stable night cream for the layman twentysomething with a penchant for parties.

Buy now

Botanics’ All Bright Hydrating Night Cream: £6.99, Boots

Another dusty rose-hued cream, this is the perfect option for the millennial who takes her generational stereotypes very seriously: are you really a millennial if your night cream isn’t millennial pink? The texture might be a little underwhelming – thin and glossy – but it’s fortified with natural exfoliation AHAs, which is beauty-speak for ‘I will brighten up your hungover skin’. Apply after a night on the tiles and even if you wake up feeling rotten, at least your face will look rejuvenated.

Buy now

Clinique’s Smart Night Custom-Repair Moisturiser: £51, Clinique

When you open a pot of Clinque’s smart nuit cream, it’s a bit like tugging at the melted mozzarella on a piece of pizza: stringy and elasticky. That being said, it’s texture is not at all cheese-like, thank god. This cream feels pleasant when applied to the face, though it doesn’t keep your skin feeling soft for too long, as it dries rather quickly. Of course, this is a night cream, so a fast-drying feature is no bad thing; few people would want to apply a product only to wake up and find half of it had soaked their pillowcase.

Suitable for combination to oily skin, it’s the perfect option for twenty somethings prone to breakouts and blackheads. It’s also free from oil, which is a massive plus. This is a cream you could apply every night with the confidence that it will not leave your skin feeling greasy and slippery, as some cheaper options might.

Buy now

By Terry’s Fundamental Repairing Night Cream: £120, Space NK

Every product By Terry creates is a treat for the senses. Its distinctive rose scent is in line with some of the brand’s hero products, such as the body moisturiser, and its lilac shade is a delight to behold. Applying this product feels like you’re feeding your skin the nutrition it’s been craving. Plus, it’s not at all greasy, making it a good choice for those with oily skin. Of course, it is on the more expensive end of what is already an expensive scale. But the fact that I really did wake up the next day with a brighter and more radiant complexion makes me think you’re getting your money’s worth with this one.

Buy now

Crème de la Mer’s Moisturising Cream: £225, Crème de la Mer

Often referred to as the holy grail of the moisturising world, we had high expectations for this cult product. It turns out, Crème de la Mer don’t have a night-time specific cream, but instead offer an all-round product that can take you from day-to-night: nifty. It feels and looks a bit like suncream. But that’s not to say it transported us to a beach in St Tropez with a single application. It’s very thick, as all good night creams should be, but it’s rich texture doesn’t allow for a smooth application.

In fact, it’s best to apply this cream in dots, or with the applicator it comes with, otherwise you’ll find yourself blotchily spreading it across your face like cold butter on bread. This cream is anything but cheap, but as it's made with seaweed extract and mineral oil, it’s a great choice for someone with dry skin that is vulnerable to winter’s chill. But for those with oily or combination skin, your money is best spent elsewhere.

Buy now

Chanel’s Le Lift Cream: £105, Feel Unique

Now, this is one fancy cream. You can tell just by looking at the black lacquer pot that something special is inside. Surprisingly light in weight and thin in texture, this product smooths over the face with unbridled ease, leaving a glossy sheen in its tracks. Again, this is a product that can be used both day and night, making it cost-effective. Lighter than its counterparts, this cream is a good choice for those with sensitive skin because it contains botanical alfalfa concentrate, which has been applauded for its gentle effect on the skin.

As for its magic overnight powers, we weren't fully convinced. It dried fairly quickly and didn’t seem to make much of a difference to my skin despite regular use. Then again, it’s Chanel, maybe it’s just meant to look pretty. If that’s its intention, Le Lift succeeds with aplomb.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best night creams for your 20s

It might be the thickest and the stickiest of all creams in the land, but Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Night Cream is undoubtedly the most effective product we tried. Not only did we wake up looking all glowy and fresh after just one application, but you really only have to use a small amount to get full coverage. It might not be cheap, but it should last you a while.

10 BEST WOMEN'S GLOVES AND WRIST WARMERS FOR WINTER 2018

Queen Elizabeth I was the ultimate glove wearer. She loved pairs decorated with rich embroidery and ones studded with jewels. The queen slid them on and teased them off at court, so that her audience would notice her elegant fingers. Or so it is said.

But you don’t need to be Elizabeth I to warrant a decent pair of gloves; you just have to be cold.

Here, we’ve found some of the finest pairs. Tempted by the fashion of the 21st century, we’ve been wearing them around town and on long, leafy walks to see how warm and comfortable they really are.

We’ve even put them on and taken them off in front of our friends and family, so that they notice and admire our garments, if not our fingers.

Gloves

Pinky Contrast Burgundy Leather Gloves: £39, Oliver Bonas

Fabric: 100 per cent leather (shell); 100 per cent polyester (lining)

Leather? Suede? We couldn’t decide which one we wanted either and were drawn to this swish pair incorporating both by British brand Oliver Bonas. These gloves are as supple and snug as they look, and are lined with snowy faux fur. A neat popper button at the wrists offers a tailored look. Queen Elizabeth I’s views are yet to be discerned, despite a weekend seance, but we couldn’t resist.

Buy now

Isotoner Ladies Luxury Suede Gloves with Faux Fur Spill: £30, Totes

Fabric: 100 per cent suede (shell); 100 per cent polyester (lining); 100 per cent polyester (trim)

On the suede front, we’ve plumped for these Isotoner gloves, available in black or navy. The fur trim made us feel suitably cosy, while the style also evoked a bit of glamour. The material suggests they’re probably not quite up to a biblical flood or helping Santa in Lapland, but they’re more than snug enough for our more temperate climes.

Buy now

Soiree Patterned Velvet Gloves: £32, Free People

Fabric: 100 per cent velvet

For the ultimate in statement gloves, we’ve gone for this stretchy velvet pair from Free People, known for its ethical clothing. There are three styles – we love the houndstooth pattern, too (very Seventies), although it’s pretty understated in comparison.

Buy now

Markberg Grey Mix Helly Gloves: £59, trouva.com

Fabric: sheep leather; 70 per cent wool / 30 per cent acrylic (lining)

We loved the versatility of these gloves. You get the benefit of leather, as well as wool cuffs that you can wear around your palms or fold down as sleeves. And most importantly, you can wear them and still use your phone.

Buy now

Cashmere Button Gloves: £35, Lavender Hill Clothing

Fabric: 100 per cent cashmere

Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, has been spotted in a Lavender Hill T-shirt. Twice. Surely, the gloves are next.

The British brand was launched in 2013 by 24-year-old Isobel Ridley.

These super-soft gloves are hand-knitted in Hawick, a town in the Scottish borders with a strong knitwear tradition. Towards the end of the 19th century, the town made more than a million pounds of wool into socks and other snuggly garments every year.

Of more immediate importance, these lovely gloves come in grey, navy, red and camel.

Buy now

Fingerless gloves

NY Charisma – Hand-Knitted Confetti Space Dyed Cable Gloves: £48, Wolf & Badger

Fabric: polyester, lambswool and nylon blend

Ah, the fingerless glove. Who wouldn’t want to rock the catwalk Dickensian look? Of course, they have other appeals, too – from allowing you to show off your rings (very 16th century) to making it easy to use your phone.

This pair by New York brand NY Charisma said winter to us. Yes, we love cashmere. But everyone needs chunky knits, too. They felt homely.

We’re particularly excited about Wolf and Badger, which curates lots of independent designers, as they’ve just opened a new store at Coal Drops Yard in King’s Cross. There’s also a store in New York.

Buy now

Cashmere Graphic Heart Wrist Warmers: £55, John Lewis & Partners

Fabric: 100 per cent cashmere (four ply)

We love this design from British brand Brora, which combines colour blocking (a key autumn/winter trend, should you like that sort of thing) with a heart motif.

We’re coveting a lot of Brora at the moment, which could be because of its sheer range of cashmere items. It also makes a point of using sustainable, ethically sourced fibre, and uses a mill in Scotland that has been going for 200 years, which sounds pretty romantic. More than 50 processes are involved in their designs. No shortcuts here.

We liked these wrist warmers, too, for their thumb cover – slightly longer than many others we tried, as well as the elasticated edges for a warmer fit.

Buy now

Cove Wrist Warmers Pink & Pink: £45, covecashmere.co.uk

Fabric: 100 per cent cashmere

Wrist warmers are everywhere this winter and we couldn’t get this minimalist design out of our heads, however much we tried. Perhaps this says something about our heads.

We suspect, however, that you’ll love them, too. They come in 10 colourways, including green and pink, blue and yellow, and the featured mulberry and neon pink. Combinations that shouldn’t work, but do.

These gloves are delicate delights.

Buy now

Cashmere Wrist Warmer Indigo: £24.95, Schöffel

Fabric: 100 per cent cashmere

When only classic will do. These simple wrist warmers by Schöffel – known for its smart countrywear – are as comfortable as they look and make a great extra layer. We loved this indigo pair, but they also come in raspberry and kingfisher (green).

Buy now

Belinda Robertson Recycled Cashmere Fingerless Gloves: £30, Atterley

Fabric: 100 per cent recycled cashmere

You can’t miss the keyword in the name of this pair – and it’s not cashmere. Yes, recycled fabric. Hooray for the planet. These soft wrist warmers come in four vivid colours: purple, salmon, red and blue.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best gloves and wrist warmers

The Oliver Bonas burgundy leather gloves tops our list for style and comfort. For mittens, we’re drawn to the chunky-knit pair by NY Charisma for originality.

FRESHERS' WEEK: FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS WARNED AFTER SPATE OF DRINK-SPIKING AT BRISTOL UNIVERSITY

Students at a top university have been warned not to leave their drinks unattended after a spate of “nasty and predatory” drink-spiking.

Police are reportedly investigating a string of incidents which have taken place at the University of Bristol during Freshers' Week.

One took place at a party at Wills Hall, the university’s halls of residence, and another two separate cases were subsequently reported.

Substances used for spiking can cause nausea and disorientation, exacerbate the effects of alcohol and even cause the victim to pass out.

Victims are more like to be subjected to theft or sexual violence.

None of those who reported having their drinks spiked are believed to be in a serious condition.

Simon Bray, director of residential and hospitality services at the University of Bristol, told The Daily Telegraph: "It goes without saying that this type of behaviour is not acceptable.

"We are extremely disappointed that it's been reported in one of our halls of residence.

"We're offering support to those affected and would urge anyone with concerns or information to speak to their warden or a senior resident.

"The university's police officer is now involved and will be looking into what has happened."

He said the university “took a zero-tolerance approach to criminal behaviour” and anyone found guilty of spiking drinks would be subject to disciplinary action.

Professor Robert Vilain, the warden of the residence, wrote on Facebook that he was "very disappointed" that this was happening at Wills Hall.

He said: "I hardly need to say how disgusting and dangerous this practice is. It is nasty, predatory behaviour, and those who do it are beneath contempt.

"Do not leave drinks unattended, even for a minute. Men are vulnerable as well as women."

The Independent has contacted Avon and Somerset police for comment.

TOP 100 UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD REVEALED

British universities have been named the best in the world for a second year running, this time boasting the two top positions in the prestigious World University Rankings.

Oxford University is ranked in first place in this year’s table, after beating US champion the California Institute of Technology for the first time last year.

An even greater achievement, arguably, was seen by rival Cambridge this year, as the institution jumped from fourth place up to second thanks to a perceived improvement in research quality.

It’s the first time in the 13-year history of the rankings that two European institutions take the top two spots.

Switzerland’s ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich) also clings onto a spot in the top 10, after dropping one place from ninth to joint 10th. Meanwhile, Trinity College Dublin has jumped 14 places to 117th this year.

Italy and Spain both have new number ones thanks to large rises for two of their institutions: Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna and Pompeu Fabra University.

But the rise of Asia is becoming an increasing threat to Europe’s standing in the rankings, its authors said.

China’s two leading universities now outrank Germany’s top institution, LMU Munich.

Germany also has two fewer institutions in the top 200; of the 20 institutions that still make this cohort, 12 have slipped.

Tsinghua University has also overtaken Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, and Peking University now outranks the Karolinska Institute and is on a par with the University of Edinburgh.

Europe now has seven institutions in the top 30 while Asia has three. Last year these figures were 10 and two respectively.

Phil Baty, editorial director of the global rankings, said: “Europe is one of the leading regions in the THE World University Rankings and is now home to more than half of the top-200 spots (101 compared to 99 last year).

“The University of Cambridge’s rise to second place, in particular, is a fantastic achievement, while other improvements show the strength of the region amid increasing global competition.

“But there are signs that Asia is starting to threaten the position of some of Europe’s leading institutions, while Brexit poses a huge risk to the success of UK universities in the future. Europe will need to work hard to ensure it can sustain its performance in future years.”

The rankings, devised annually by Times Higher Education, judge research-intensive universities across all their core missions: teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook.

UK UNIVERSITIES DOMINATE GLOBAL RANKINGS FOR FIRST TIME DESPITE BREXIT REPUTATION FEARS

British universities have taken the top two places in global league tables for the first time in 13 years, with Oxford University crowned the best in the world.

Cambridge jumped from fourth to second place in the influential World University Rankings – the first time both institutions have held the top two positions.

Collated by Times Higher Education (THE), it is also the first time two European institutions have been placed in the top two spots.

The California Institute of Technology (Caltech), which was top between 2012 and 2016, is now joint third with Stanford University, which is also based in the Golden State.

THE said the margins were extremely tight at the top of the table, with all top ranked institutions excelling across 13 performance metrics.

But one of the reasons that the British universities triumphed was that they registered significant increases in their total institutional income – up 24 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.

Cambridge also saw improvements in its research quality, the judges said.

The university’s vice chancellor, Professor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, said it confirmed the institution was “among a small group of the most respected higher education institutions globally”.

He added: “We welcome the fact that UK institutions feature so highly in this year’s rankings, demonstrating their continued importance to the country and its economy.”

Caltech and Stanford, meanwhile, experienced significant falls in revenue this year – down 23 per cent and 24 per cent respectively.

The results will be welcomed by academics and industry leaders across the UK, some of whom have expressed fears over the negative impact Brexit might have on Britain’s highly regarded reputation for research.

But the researchers behind the tables nonetheless warned that the results underlined the risk leaving the European Union (EU) might pose to the UK’s global performance.

They also suggested that the full effects of Britain’s separation from the EU are yet to be felt.

Almost a quarter of the research funding from competitive grants to the University of Cambridge comes from the EU, while the proportion at the University of Oxford is about a fifth.

There are already signs that UK universities are already starting to suffer from the Brexit vote, with the number of EU applicants applying for full-time undergraduate courses in the UK declining by five per cent since last year.

Phil Baty, editorial director for the THE Global Rankings, said: “The UK higher education system is facing intense political pressure, with questions over the value for money provided by £9,250 tuition fees in England, our continued attractiveness to international students, the flow of research funding and academic talent post-Brexit, and even levels of vice-chancellors’ pay.

“The data shows UK universities are consistently producing ground-breaking new research which is driving innovation, they are attracting international student and academic talent and are providing a world-class teaching environment. They are a huge national asset, and one that the country can ill afford to undermine at a time when its place in the global order is under intense scrutiny.”

The latest rankings also serve to highlight what is at stake if funding is not assured for British universities, he said.

“If we cannot agree a sustainable way to properly fund our universities, we fail to welcome global students, and if the research funding and academic talent that current comes to us from the European Union is cut off.

“But one thing this new data makes absolutely clear is that the UK has many of the very best universities in the world and it has one of the world’s strongest higher education systems.”

The findings also suggest a widening gulf between the UK’s super elite institutions and other universities.

Oxford, Cambridge and London universities have remained steady in the rankings. Imperial College London remained in eighth place, while University College London went down by one place to 16th. The London School of Economics (LSE) remained in 25th place.

However, several of the lower-ranked universities had fallen in the rankings.

The University of Warwick dropped nine places to 91st and the University of St Andrews plummeted 33 places to joint 143rd.

The majority that lost places suffered falls in their reputations for teaching and research. Several Asian institutions had improved on these metrics.

Peking University, for example, is now on par with the University of Edinburgh. Both share joint 27th place with New York University.

But this year’s THE rankings follow the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) rankings, published by the Government for the first time this year as a way of measuring value for money in UK institutions.

Just under a third of the Russell Group institutions – considered the best in the country – scored gold after being judged across a wide criteria that included student experience, teaching quality and research.

The new framework produced a number of shock results. Warwick University was beaten by neighbouring Coventry, a former polytechnic, after it failed to score the top rating.

World-renowned London School of Economics expressed serious disappointment after scoring bronze, along with the universities of Liverpool and Southampton. Several institutions have since appealed against their ratings.

SUICIDE RATES NEARLY DOUBLE AMONG UK UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TO REACH ALL-TIME HIGH, STUDY FINDS

A new study has found that more students than ever are killing themselves due to financial and academic pressures.

The number of students with mental health problems at university has risen to its highest level with a record 15,395 students disclosing their mental health issues in their first year – a fivefold increase in a decade.

The investigation by think tank IPPR has revealed the scale of university students suffering from depression and anxiety with 134 students taking their own lives in 2015, according to The Guardian.

Experts put the rise down to more pressures on university students as well as an increase in awareness about mental health making it easier for students to come forward.

However, the study found that university services are “overwhelmed” by the increase.

“Universities must be ready to support these students, including, where appropriate, through referral into specialist care. But the extent of support is currently too varied, and many university services are overwhelmed by the level of demand,” Craig Thorley, an IPPR senior research fellow, told The Guardian.

The report found that the number of students who were using counselling services, or on the waiting list, was as great as 26 per cent in some universities.

Mark Salter, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “We know that the Government needs to do much more.

“Suicide is preventable … without proper resourcing and funding, we will not reduce suicide in England.”

SEVEN BEST WAYS TO GET INVOLVED WITH MUSIC AT UNIVERSITY

A cappella

Since Pitch Perfect arrived in cinemas and got stuck in our heads, university campuses have seen an upsurge in a cappella groups.

For those who are serious about harmonising, there is also the chance to compete at the annual Voice Festival UK, which holds regional competitions before a national final.

The University of Exeter’s Semi-Toned won the Voice Festival UK 2015 and BBC2 competition The Choir: Gareth’s Best in Britain 2016. For those who do not want to rehearse three times a week all year round there are plenty of groups with a more laid back approach.

Ensembles

Many universities have thriving extracurricular music clubs - think orchestras, big bands, concert bands, even nose-flute choirs - even if they don't teach a music degree.

While there is fierce competition in many of the orchestras and big bands, many ensembles are not auditioned and offer the chance to play with a large number of people for performances a few times a year.

Musical theatre

A great way to get involved in a huge production and meet like-minded creative people is to play in a pit band for a musical theatre show.

University is a great opportunity to indulge any previously hidden interest in performing, often with free use of stage, props, lighting and actors.

If there's not already a group or society for you to sign up to, why not start your own?

Theatre

Straight theatre shows often look for musicians to play incidental music to enhance a particular atmosphere and at times take centre stage.

More often than not, contemporary productions of Shakespeare include music, definitely one to watch out for.

Campaigning

Some universities use music as a voice to protest or support relevant causes.

The School of Oriental and African Studies’ “Sambatage” is a Brazilian drumming group which attends demonstrations to “not only do good and stand up for what is right, but also make sure that justice is served in the most positive and eclectic fashion".

The group also plays for end of year parties and fun events.

Open mic nights

Keep an eye out for open mic nights in your university area, they are an excellent place to network.

When looking for members of a new band or to find out more about where to perform in the area, they are often the place to be.

University journalism

You don't need to play an instrument to engage with it as a hobby - there are plenty of writing opportunities too.

Ask your campus paper if you can pull some gig reviews or thought pieces.

Magazines such as the University of Exeter’s PearShaped aim to bridge the gap between students and locals to give undergraduates an insight into the music scene.

FRESHER'S WEEK 2017: 5 BEST TYPES OF SOCIETIES TO JOIN

Heading to university can be a very exciting time for new students.

Taking your studies to the next level - often in strange and unknown surroundings - can seem overwhelming, however.

With so many opportunities opened up to you, how is a student to know how best to make the most of it all this Fresher's term?

Joining a society can be a great way to integrate yourself into new surroundings and make friends along the way.

Most institutions have hundreds of groups to choose from - it would be impossible to take part in them all.

The best thing to do is to work out your own personal priorities - what are you looking for in a society? Careers contacts? Fitness? A good drinking buddy?

Here are some of the categories they fall into.

Keeping physically active

Aside from competing in the inter-university leagues, there are many different ways of keeping fit.

You can counteract heavy drinking schedules and academic-induced stress with classes like yoga, zumba or even hill walking which are a boost for morale and a great way to meet new people.

University is a great time to try something new, so why not try a martial art or ultimate frisbee?

Thinking about employers

The job market is increasingly difficult to enter for new graduates so thinking about how to boost your employability through the societies you join is a good idea.

If you want to become a lawyer, join the law society, an engineer, the engineering society. If you’re not sure what career path you want to go down, join a society that improves your transferable “soft” skills.

Many employers want to see evidence of leadership skills and organisation. Take on a position of responsibility in a society so that you can learn how to manage people.

Making a difference

Join a society which volunteers in the community. Have an aptitude for music or sport? Get into local schools and inspire children to get into what you love.

The School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London has over 25 volunteering and humanitarian societies, including, SOAS Against Human Trafficking and Students Against Incarceration.

Learning a language

Broaden your cultural boundaries by brushing shoulders with native speakers of, let’s say, Spanish. As you learn your new language you’ll be forming new connections, improving your employability and possibly travelling abroad.

You could even discover that you have a different personality when speaking a foreign language.

According to New Republic, academics Jean-Marc Dewaele and Aneta Pavlenko asked over one thousand linguists whether they “feel like a different person” when they speak another language. Approximately two-thirds said that they did.

Having fun

You’re only young once, so they say, so enjoy it while you can. Not all society memberships need to be especially career boosting, or serious - far better to make the most of all the free time left over for something fun and unusual...

The Durham University Assasins’ Society involves members “hunting and killing each other across Durham using a variety of safe 'weaponry',” according to the society’s website.

“Some members turn into cool, calm, collected and ruthlessly efficient killing machines, whereas others become jibbering wrecks, torn apart by paranoia, lying awake at night huddled close to their excessive arsenal of destructive weaponry.”

WHAT STUDENTS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT UNIVERSITY AND MENTAL HEALTH

Going to university is a hugely exciting time: you'll meet new and interesting people, live independently, and no doubt have experiences that will stay with you for the rest of your life.

But making such a big move – may it be geographically or purely academically – can also be stressful.

As a university Head of Student Support, I’ve listened to many students who have told me about the difficulties they’ve faced adapting to life away from home. Fortunately, there are a few easy steps you can take to prepare yourself for and overcome these difficulties, whether you are worried about university or not.

It’s important to bear these steps in mind because ultimately, if high stress situations go unmanaged, they can sometimes develop and even lead to mental illness.

A useful place to start is preparation before you head off. It is helpful to know about the town, city or area you are going to before you arrive.

Work out where the centre of town is in relation to your accommodation and the university campus. Is it within walking distance? If not, it is a good idea to explore the public transport so you know what to expect ahead of arriving.

It’s also wise to register with a doctor’s surgery. Don’t wait until you’re ill - it’s no fun form-filling if you’re sat there feeling rough.

In addition to the local area, you can also explore what – and who – awaits you in your more immediate surroundings. When I went to university, the first time I met my flatmates was when I arrived. Nowadays, you can join social media groups, chat to second year students, find out who is in your halls and prepare for your course before you’ve even finished packing.

Technology is your friend here; spend time building networks, meeting like-minded people and finding out about support services the university offers. Once you have arrived, take a follow up tour and find out where those services are on campus.

If you can, keep active. Regular exercise can boost your self-esteem and help you concentrate, sleep better and feel better. Exercise keeps the brain and other vital organs healthy, and is a significant benefit to your mental health.

Exercise doesn’t have to be running miles and miles on a treadmill. Street dance, rock and roll class, self-defence and playing a recreational or competitive sport can give you a real buzz and keep you in shape.

Eating well and drinking sensibly are also important, as both can have a long lasting effect on mental health. Your brain needs a mixture of nutrients in order to stay healthy and function well.

A healthy diet should include different types of fruit and vegetable, wholegrain cereals or breads, nuts and seeds, some dairy, oily fish and plenty of water. Drink alcohol in moderation and not too often; excessive alcohol can have serious effects on your mental and physical health – not to mention the dent it will put in your finances!

You may also want share your skills more widely and do some volunteer work.

Most universities will offer students the opportunity to do this and it can make you feel valued, boost self-esteem and help you settle in to your new town or city. It may also enable you to see any problems you are facing from a different angle, or put them into perspective, and will look fantastic on your CV when it comes to applying for jobs.

As well as students taking it upon themselves to stay healthy, there is also a responsibility on universities to ensure the provision they are offering is adequate.

That means support services that are fit for purpose and meet the needs of their student body – not just a one-size-fits-all. Most services, such as the one here at the University of Bedfordshire, are strong and will include qualified counsellors and mental health advisors who are used to supporting students.

Students with mental illness may be entitled to additional support via the Disabled Students’ Allowance, so it’s important for university teams to understand the processes well, and do refresher courses when regulations change.

University should be a time of great excitement and a time of growth, both mentally and academically. But if you do feel down at any point, I would always suggest speaking to someone about what you’re feeling. It doesn’t have to be a big deal, just wait for the conversation to develop naturally; you’ll be amazed what a difference a friendly chat can make.

DRIVERLESS CARS COULD SEE PEOPLE SPRAWL EVER FURTHER INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE

Self-driving cars will change how we live, in all sorts of ways. But they won’t just affect us humans – the coming revolution in autonomous transport has significant implications for wildlife as well. Nature conservationists and planners need to think hard about the impact of driverless vehicles, most notably in terms of renewed urban sprawl.

In some ways, wider developments in automotive technology bode well for the environment. Electric cars will increasingly replace the internal combustion engine, and that should, in theory, reduce carbon emissions and health-afflicting air pollution.

Through minimising traffic jams, driverless cars may also reduce overall energy use. Unlike human drivers, computers can avoid the “concertina” effect of needless acceleration and braking that exacerbates congestion, and won’t be tempted to “rubberneck” when passing an accident. And, as autonomous vehicles aren’t restricted by human reaction times, it may make sense to increase speed limits for them on major inter-city routes.

So driverless cars promise a future of faster journey times with much reduced environmental impacts. They may even mean less wildlife roadkill. But it’s the very efficiency of driverless cars that poses a challenge for planners and conservationists. The threat is an unchecked increase in low-density urbanisation.

Driving into the countryside

Autonomous vehicles promise a future in which passengers are free to use their time productively (working, for example). And they can park themselves (or be part of a shared pool) which saves yet more time in the morning rush. Coupled with faster journey times, the incentives to live further out of town will increase significantly.

There are both push and pull factors at work here: sky-high residential prices in most cities push people away from urban centres while healthy environments and green living pull people towards the hinterlands. The limiting factor in suburban spread is often travel time, either by public or private means. Driverless cars fundamentally alter the equation.

Existing planning policies are based on our current transport systems. Green-belts, for example, are designed to reduce urban sprawl by restricting development within a buffer zone around an urban area. However, the reduced transport times offered by driverless cars make it easier to live outside the belt while still working inside. So these loops of green are in danger of becoming a thin layer in a sandwich of ever-spreading suburbanisation.

This is, of course, a familiar challenge since the rise of the automotive age in the 1940s. However, the solutions designed by planners have been calibrated for a human-driving automotive system – not for the supercharged future of driverless transport.

Other examples of planning protection for wildlife include nature reserves, national parks and (in the UK) “Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty”. Such areas have either strict controls on development, or do not permit it at all. However, they are nice places to live in or nearby. The coming revolution in automotive journey times and the ability to work behind the (computer-driven) wheel will make living in such areas increasingly compatible with a commute to the nearest city.

Sick of sprawl

Natural habitats being lost entirely or splintered into ever-smaller fragments have long been understood as some of the primary causes of species extinctions across the world. Renewed urban sprawl threatens to increase the magnitude of both habitat loss and fragmentation. These threats are well known among conservationists, but there are differences of opinion on how best to respond.

For example, eco-modernists advocate a strategy of “land-sparing”, whereby human activities are concentrated into urban areas and vast tracts of land are set aside for nature. There are many cultural and ethical problems inherent in herding humans into cities, but the near-term planning issues posed by autonomous vehicles will exacerbate the challenge given they will boost demand to live in “unspared” lands.

Alternatively, some conservationists advocate “land-sharing”, in which human communities redesign the way we farm and live so as to co-exist with wildlife, cheek-by-jowl. Autonomous vehicles pose significant challenges for either approach, by supercharging the fragmentary effect of road systems.

Whichever approach is taken, we’ll need to redesign existing systems and policies to take account of the increased range that driverless transport facilitates. This may involve new zoning laws to protect wider areas of countryside than at present. It certainly requires further development of green infrastructure, habitat corridors and “greenways”.

It might also involve engineering solutions, especially given the fact that autonomous vehicles should be much more amenable to being driven underground. It is possible to imagine a future in which the famous bear bridges of Banff are tiny precursors to a vast programme in which rural highways are covered with forests of green. Retro-fitting roads into tunnels won’t be cheap, but it becomes easier when human drivers are taken out of the equation. Software drivers are less bothered by artificial light and more efficient at mitigating the congestion impact during construction.

Much conservation policy is based on planning for the world we live in now. Strategic conservation planning needs instead to take account of likely futures. And in a future of driverless cars, that is likely to result in the mega cities of the 20th century becoming the mega sprawls of the 21st. Unless, of course, planners and conservationists rise to this new challenge.

6 UNEXPECTEDLY VITAL THINGS TO PACK FOR YOUR FIRST TERM AT UNIVERSITY

With A-level results in hand, thousands of students across the country will soon be planning their time at university as the next big step.

If you’re moving out for the first time, it’s normal to want to make sure you’re prepared for every eventuality. But while cutlery, shower gel and your trusty ID are likely topping your list, you might want to consider taking some add-ons to help you acclimatise to your first few months away.

Trust us, you won't have thought of them all...

Earplugs

Fresher’s week can leave you with some heartwarming stories. Marathoning Netflix series with new friends, wobbling your way home after a night of drinks n’ dance, blasting the Disney soundtrack with your flatmates in the kitchen at 2am...

But once the Fresher’s hype dies down, you’ll more than likely want to take time to recover. If the rest of your student halls are determined to be crowned party-central, having a way to dull the noise can really save you your sanity.

Nocturnal working and caffeine obsession may be a well-worn student trope, but trust me. It’s not the happiest lifestyle for revision.

Lemsip

If you’ve got friends who are already at university, chances are you’ve heard them curse the scourges of ‘Freshers’ Flu’.

It’s true; after a full week of flaring discos and vodka-infused housewarmings, welcome week commonly results in feeling quite under the weather. Once grogginess strikes and lectures begin, you might feel in need of a pick-me-up before heading to your first lecture on a Monday.

Paracetamol or aspirin will work to similar effect, but swaddling yourself in blankets with a hot, lemony beverage appears much more comforting when you’re feeling ill.

Folders

If there’s one thing university lectures are great at, it’s deluging students with reams of information.

Often, this information is handily written down, but as most full-time students study three different modules each semester, you’ll quickly find yourself wading through a muddled compendium of email addresses, course descriptions and homework deadlines.

It’s good to dedicate a folder to each module you’ll be studying, but bear in mind you’ll likely have medical notes, accommodation documents and careers information to take care of too.

You might also want to make a little "black book" of contact details you pick up along the way - by this we mean using pen and paper, not just your phone.

Food Containers

Balancing tutorials, events and recreational activities doesn’t always leave you with bundles of time.

When you get home late with your stomach growling for sustenance, having a quick means for cooking dinner can make life a lot easier. It's also much healthier and cost effective than a takeaway.

The benefits of a good tupperware collection are (almost) endless. Use them to carry a packed lunch with you to uni so you're not tempted by the burger bar at the canteen, or cook up a big vat of spag bol or soup and save batches in the freezer for later in the week.

This may not be what your mum bought them for, but you'll find they also make a great last minute punch-bowl for flat parties...

A door stop

Not the most obvious item on the list, but this little gem could be the saviour of your social life.

It's clear the average university bedroom is designed with health and safety in mind - this means fire doors that slam shut at every corner.

While we're not advocating going against the rules as such, the ability to keep your door open in the first few days especially can help let housemates know you're a friendly person open to conversation.

A Funny Hat

Okay, not necessarily a hat. While meeting people from different walks of life can be one of the most exciting things about moving to university, some students find it difficult to break the ice with their flatmates.

The initial meet-and-greet may at first seem daunting, but nothing quite diffuses the tension like a novelty item. Whether it’s the Guinness hat you wore on St. Paddy’s, or that bizarro jumper your Nan got you last Christmas, if you’re stuck for conversation-starters, bringing along something striking can really help…well, strike up a conversation.

Maybe leave the banana costume for laundry day, though.

A-LEVEL RESULTS DAY: RECORD NUMBER OF STUDENTS SCORE UNIVERSITY PLACES ON FIRST DAY OF CLEARING

Record numbers of students have secured university places through clearing this A-level results day, official figures show, with universities still left scrambling to fill thousands more vacancies.

Industry leaders have described this year’s process as a “buyer’s market”, with students finding themselves in a powerful position to pick and choose between courses.

Some universities are said to be offering cash bonuses, laptops, gym membership and even free flights in a bid to secure students.

By midnight on results day, 11,180 people had secured a place through clearing – the process by which students can apply for leftover courses or “trade up an existing offer” – more than double the total of five years ago.

With the process still ongoing, the total number of clearing applicants is not yet known, but early indicators suggest universities are being quicker off the mark to fill places, with fewer students eligible for recruitment.

Figures from the Ucas university admissions service suggest there has never been a better time to enter clearing amid a fall in overall applications and acceptances, leading to fewer students being free to enter the annual process.

A Press Association survey suggests that the vast majority of universities, including many top Russell Group institutions, are entering clearing.

But greater freedom for applicants to swap their offers comes at a price, warned the University of Buckingham vice chancellor Sir Anthony Seldon.

“It’s very good for students but it’s such an imperfect market,” he told The Independent. “It’s the same with schools – some who are at the top of the league tables are not doing a lot, they just have extraordinary pupils who work extremely hard and bring in the results.

“There’s a worry that students with good grades will be rushing to swap their offers for ones at more fashionable places – universities further up the league table with good names.

“I can understand why they might want to do that, but students should be wary. The new TEF rankings go to show that the best ranking places won’t necessarily have the best teaching.

“My advice would be to think about what is suitable for them. Drill down, shop around and don’t just go where your friends are going.”

Buckingham University came out top in the Government’s new teaching excellence framework rankings.

The private university’s clearing applicants have gone up by around a third on this time last year.

The latest Ucas snapshot shows that 437,070 people had been accepted on to courses as of midnight on Thursday, down 1.3 per cent compared to the same point last year – around 20,700 fewer in total.

Clearing, which opened on Thursday, is the annual system that matches students without degree places, such as those that failed to meet the entry requirements for their chosen course, with courses that still have availability.

The number of students eligible to be placed in clearing is down 12 per cent (around 18,000 people) compared to last year, the figures show.

The falls mean many more options are available to students hoping to start degree courses this autumn, with less competition among those still searching for a place.

There have been reports that a number of universities are lowering their entry requirements to attract students.

Ucas chief executive Clare Marchant said: “At the start of today [Friday] there were 134,840 applicants in clearing, compared to 153,010 in 2016 and with nearly 45,000 courses looking for students there is a huge amount of choice out there.”

The Government’s move to lift the cap on student numbers in England two years ago means universities are at liberty to recruit as many undergraduates as they choose.

But critics say the move has led to a fall in degree quality, with increasing numbers of students graduating with first-class degrees from institutions which act more like businesses.

“I think it’s a shame about the coming off of the cap,” said Sir Anthony. “Really big universities are going to get too big, and there are fantastic ones who are going to get really squeezed.”

With no limit on the number of students they can recruit, some universities are becoming greedy and student experience is suffering as a result, he suggested.

The Press Association survey, based on 148 universities, shows a total of 26,654 undergraduate courses showing availability for students in England.

Almost nine out of 10 of the institutions included in the survey (132) were advertising at least one course on the Ucas website for these students.

Clearing will remain open until 2 September, but Ucas officials predict the majority of places will be secured this weekend.

Ms Marchant added: “I would urge anyone who is unsure of their next steps to visit ucas.com where you can search all the courses available and where there is lots of information about all of your options.”

Students can also get in touch with the admissions service via phone or social media, she said, as well as signing up for a “direct contact service” which allows universities and colleges to get in touch with unplaced applicants.

Overall, 649,700 people had applied to start degree courses by 30 June, the last deadline for applications, down around 4 per cent (25,190) compared with this point last year, according to previous Ucas figures.

A-LEVEL RESULTS 2017: EIGHT THINGS TO DO IF YOU DIDN'T GET THE GRADES YOU WANTED

A-level results day can be one of the most daunting experiences of any teenager’s life. The next day the papers are filled with cheesy photos of happy students jumping and throwing papers into the air. But while thousands celebrate, not everyone will be sure of the next step.

So what can you do if you didn’t get the grades you were hoping for?

If you're disappointed with your grades, or simply unsure of the choices you're making, the first thing to do is take a moment and relax. You won’t be the first person it’s happened to, and you won’t be the last.

There are plenty of options for you to take and - you never know - in five years’ time not getting the grades you wanted could be the best thing that ever happened to you.

In the meantime, here are five things you can do if your heart is still set on university, and three things you can do if you’re not sure.

Still wanting to go to university?

Go through clearing

Clearing should be your first choice. In the week after the 2016 results, a record number of people got accepted into university through clearing, and this year the figure is set to be even bigger.

A fall in pass grades and overall application rates has resulted in thousands of courses being made available at really sought after institutions - so it’s your quickest route to go if you’re eager to start this September.

For more help, take a look at our ultimate guide to Clearing.

Get a remark

There’s nothing more painful than being one or two marks off your required grade. Try not to think back to that exam you weren't pleased with, or the coursework you could have spent more time on, and focus on getting your papers remarked.

You might have to wait a bit longer, but it’s a small price to pay. Speak to your school or college advisor on how to go through with this. You may have to pay a fee towards this depending on your school.

Retake the year

There’s absolutely no shame in retaking the year - many people do it and find all they needed was some extra time to get their work in order.

It might be difficult seeing friends leave sixth form and go on to university without you, but they'll still be there a year later. If it gets you to where you need to be, it’ll be worth it. Besides, there’ll be fewer distractions for you second time round, you’ll have had a head-start, and you can focus more on the fun stuff like exams, and constant revision...

Look for a sponsored degree

Plenty of companies offer things called "sponsored degrees" where you basically get paid to go to university - sounds great, right? The details can vary from degree to degree, but the general idea is that you work X amount of days in a week and go to university to study for the other X. A combination of paid work, job training, and a university education!

Apply next year

Take a breath. Relax. You’ve just finished 13 really hard years of school (mostly). You don’t have to apply this year- you can wait until next time when you know what grades you have and you know what you have to work with.

It’s all far less stressful this way. The plus side of this is that you can work for a year, then hopefully go to university with some money saved up - win, win.

What to do if you don’t want to go to university at all anymore?

Go straight into a job

University isn’t for everyone, you may find yourself happiest going straight into the workplace. Earning a wage is an extremely satisfying thing, and having that independence could be the different lifestyle you need after school.

Look into a higher apprenticeship

Higher apprenticeships are exactly what it says on the tin. It’s an apprenticeship which you gain a higher than usual qualification for.

You’ll come out with a level 4 qualification, which is equivalent to a university degree, but you’ll get a combination of practical experience as well as formal education.

It’s similar to a sponsored degree, but generally with a more vocational focus. According to figures from Barclays and the Centre for Economics and Business Research, In some cases the earnings of apprenticeship graduates can surpass that of graduates by up to 270 per cent.

Take a gap year

You will have heard it all already: "Being a student is the best time to go travelling"... and it’s true. It’s a great middle point in your life where you can just decide to postpone the next step and disappear with a backpack.

Taking a year out can arm you with rich experiences, a better understanding of other cultures, and space to breathe and find out what you really enjoy and want from life.

Check out our gap year guide if you need more convincing.

The most important thing is not to panic, and to realise just how many exciting opportunities are open to you. Your schools are well prepared to help you, so you’re not on your own. Decide what you’re doing, and then relax and enjoy the summer - you’ve earned it.

UNIVERSITY CLEARING AND ADJUSTMENT: IT IS TIME TO STOP THE BUN FIGHT

Student recruitment has changed so much over the years; it’s no longer recognisable from when I went to university (not even that long ago) in 2000.

I remember what it was like the week before A-Level results day – giddy excitement at the prospect of taking up your place at your chosen university, but with a creeping dread that if you didn’t get the grades you’d be relegated to the ‘bun fight’ that was Clearing.

August represents a golden opportunity both for students and for universities. In the open market that higher education now (almost) is, Clearing is so much more than those who didn’t do so well scrabbling around for places.

Nowadays, competition is so fierce for talent; places at almost every university are still up for grabs at this time of year through Clearing and through the Adjustment process - where students "trade up" for places if they get higher than expected results.

Unlike previous generations, today's students have incredible power when it comes to choosing where to study, only I’m not sure they all realise it.

Most students are aware that they have many options available after receiving their A-Level results. What they perhaps don’t realise is that the process of changing your mind does not have to be, and should not be, a mad rush.

It used to be that students were scrambling to get places – now it is universities competing for the best students. In all this madness, within an expanded sector, A-Level results day has become increasingly important in the recruitment cycle.

Universities offer a wide range of courses and options, and students often have to decide if this is the offer for them in a very short space of time.

The truth is, students often have longer than they might think to decide whether to take up their offer of a place. It’s up to universities to make sure they know how long they have, and to ensure this gives them the time they need to decide. Universities that don’t allow students sufficient time, in my mind, are making a rod for their own back - but more on this later.

For us at Sheffield, it is important that students have time when it comes to considering our offer of a place through Clearing or Adjustment. We like to give them the opportunity to sleep on it and come back to us (in fact, we usually give them three days).

We think it is important students are able to make a properly informed decision. Students can use this time to research our University, and to come and visit us, getting a feel for our campus and accommodation.

Many universities will offer a ‘guaranteed place in accommodation’. This is of course, a good thing, but how many universities allow Clearing students to visit this accommodation before accepting a place? Living arrangements are a really important consideration alongside their choice of subject to study; this extra time means students can make a fully informed decision, on their course, location and accommodation.

Many students coming to a university through Clearing or Adjustment won’t have visited the university they are now applying for, and so having this opportunity is invaluable to a student who has unexpected results – good or bad.

Apart from being beneficial to long-term student wellbeing and helping by offering some reassurance in what is already a pressurised situation, universities themselves stand to gain from giving students a bit more time. Why would any university want to recruit a student who had rushed their decision? Surely universities want students who have thought carefully about their choice, and have decided to accept a place because the course and culture of the institution is the right fit for them.

I think recruiters can sometimes underestimate the decision-making capability of young people; if they have the information, and a little time, they do make good (and necessarily personal) choices. By encouraging students to rush their decision, institutions run the risk of students regretting their choice and dropping out – the worst outcome for both parties, but especially the student.

It is time for the sector to re-evaluate this part of the recruitment cycle. We need to think carefully about the environment we are creating for those students making important choices at this time of year. At Sheffield, we endeavour to give students time for proper consideration of their offer, but our efforts as responsible recruiters could be in vain if other universities are pushing the same students to make decisions in a short time frame.

I know that my frustration is shared by many in the sector and other recruiters also feel there is a need to change the process to reflect the changing nature of HE recruitment.

Perhaps this is something for the new Chief Executive of Ucas to think about?

STATE SCHOOL PUPILS HAVE 'REDUCED CHANCE' OF WINNING OXBRIDGE PLACES AS THEY APPLY TO OVERSUBSCRIBED COURSES

State school pupils are lowering their chances of winning a place at Oxbridge because they are more likely to apply for over-subscribed subjects, latest analysis suggests.

State-educated sixth-formers hoping to go on to the UK’s most prestigious institutions are more likely to apply for the most popular courses than those who attend fee-paying schools, according to figures obtained by the Press Association.

Privately educated pupils are more likely to apply for the least over-subscribed, earning them a better chance of being accepted for an interview.

Responding to the statistics, one charity said that privately educated pupils may be “gaming the system”, while private school leaders argued that they offer a wide range of subjects that are useful to many Oxbridge subjects.

The figures show that last year, almost a third of applications (30.7 per cent) from UK state school students were for the five most over-subscribed subjects at Cambridge, compared to 28.4 per cent of private school applications.

The five most over-subscribed subjects were Computer Science, Economics, Engineering, Psychological and Behavioural Studies, and Human, Social and Political Sciences.

By comparison, around a fifth (19.5 per cent) of UK independent school applications were for Cambridge's five least over-subscribed subjects (Classics, Music, Modern Languages, History and Geography), compared to around one in eight (12.4 per cent) of all state school applications.

The more niche subjects such as Classics are typically dominated by private school applicants, separate figures have shown, since they courses are rarely taught in state local authority schools.

Data published by Oxford shows that “state applicants' success rate is affected by subject choice” with UK students applying “disproportionately for the most over-subscribed subjects”.

Between 2014 and 2016, on average, around a third (34 per cent) of UK state school applications were for the prestigious institution's five most over-subscribed subjects (Economics and Management; Medicine; Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE); Law and Mathematics) compared to just over one in four (28 per cent) of private school applications.

In addition, the university said, state school students apply in “disproportionately low numbers” for the least over-subscribed subjects (Classics, Music, Modern Languages, Chemistry and History).

Between 2014 and 2016, almost a quarter (24 per cent) of applications from UK privately educated students were for these courses, compared to just 17 per cent of all state school applications.

Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of social mobility charity the Sutton Trust, said it was “concerning” that state school pupils are more likely to choose subjects that are oversubscribed, “reducing their chances of getting in”.

“Students should choose the subject that's the best fit for them, rather than picking subjects to 'game the system',” he said.

”It may be that independent schools are able to give better information and guidance about which course their pupils are likely to get in to.

“Universities and state schools have to work together to make sure all young people have the support they need to navigate the broad range of subjects on offer.

”State school students should have the same advice and guidance as those from independent schools when it comes to deciding which subjects to apply to.“

But Peter Hamilton, of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, which represents private school leaders, and head of Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in Hertfordshire, said that the figures are explained by the ”range of sixth-form studies that different schools can offer and the breadth of high-level attainment that each school achieves“.

“In independent schools we are fortunate to be able to offer students an exceptionally wide choice at A-level and Pre-U (specialist subject exams offered by one of Cambridge University's exam boards), as well as the International Baccalaureate,“ he said.

“These sixth-form studies map onto the same wide range of traditional subjects offered by Oxford and Cambridge, such as classics, music and modern languages.

“In recent years our colleagues in state schools have had to limit subject choice and increase class sizes because of austerity.

“This has had the effect of concentrating high attainment in state schools in a smaller set of disciplines which, in turn, generates high numbers of applications per place in certain Oxbridge subjects.“

Oxford University, which has the lowest proportion of state educated students in the country, said it saw a fall in applicants from state schools overall last year.

Despite government efforts to increase access to universities and improve careers guidance in schools, pupils from less affluent backgrounds are already significantly less likely to be accepted onto a university course, according to official Ucas figures.

The gap between rich and poor students being granted places reached a record high this year, prompting concerns over the lack of social mobility within higher education.

Dr Samina Khan, Oxford's director of undergraduate admissions and outreach, said: ”Students from the state sector do tend to apply for Oxford's most competitive courses, as well as the more vocational courses.

“Much of our outreach work is aimed at giving state school students the best possible information and advice about both the Oxford admissions process and the range of careers open to Oxford graduates regardless of their chosen course.”

Oxford received more than 19,000 applications last year and Cambridge around 16,750.

The figures come in the week that teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland receive their A-level results.

University apologises after students told they would not graduate

University officials blame the rogue email on a ‘system error’ but insist there has been no breach of its security systems

PROFESSOR SAYS STUDENTS SHOULD CHOOSE OWN GRADES TO HELP REDUCE STRESS

A university professor has found what he believes to be a solution to work-based stress by allowing his students to choose their own grades.

Dr Richard Watson, a Business teacher from the University of Georgia, US, has proposed a “stress reduction policy” for his classes because “emotional reactions to stressful situations can have profound consequences for all involved”.

According to his course syllabi, obtained by Campus Reform, if students feel “unduly stressed” by grades given for any assessment during the course, they can “email the instructor indicating what grade [they] think is appropriate, and it will be so changed” with “no explanation” required.

Students who feel stressed by “group dynamics” are also permitted to walk away from their work groups without explanation, and will only be graded on their individual work thereafter.

Responding to the attention his policies have received, Dr Watson stated that his syllabus is yet to be confirmed.

“There is no such policy on the current website”, he said in an email.

“I’ve been making changes over the last week in preparation for going live next week when classes start.”

According to the original document published on the university site, students taking part in the professor’s Data Management and Energy Informatics classes will also be required to have “open book and open notes” tests, “designed to assess low level mastery of the course material”.

For in-class presentations, “only positive comments” are to be given, with any necessary suggestions for improvement in future presentations “communicated by email”.

While Dr Watson did note that the laissez-faire policies “might hinder the development of group skills and mastery of the class material,” the outcomes are ultimately the responsibility of the student, he said.

He promises to “provide every opportunity for [students] to gain high level mastery", however.

In a statement, the dean of the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business said the syllabus “did not conform with the university’s rigorous expectations”.

“I have explained this discrepancy to the professor, and he has removed the statement from his syllabus,” said Dean Benjamin C. Ayers.

“Rest assured that this ill-advised proposal will not be implemented in any Terry classroom.”

STUDENT SATISFACTION LEVELS FALL AMID NATIONWIDE PROTEST AGAINST RISING TUITION FEES

Students across the country have voiced their objections to rising tuition fees by refusing to take part in this year’s highly anticipated National Student Survey (NSS).

Brand new figures published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) reveal a decline in student satisfaction levels for the first time in years, with some 84 per cent of final-year students saying they feel happy with the quality of their education, down from the record 86 per cent of the previous three years.

While the vast majority of the university and college students who did respond did so positively, this year’s publication shows a dramatic fall in participation – down by 12,000 people on 2016.

This is despite a total of 530 higher education providers taking part – an increase of around 50 per cent.

The decline in responses could largely be a result of some of the biggest and most prestigious institutions staging a student-wide boycott of the survey.

But the survey was also targeted at a higher number of students this year – 446,000 up from 431,000 in 2016.

By The Independent’s calculations, around one third of students targeted with the survey this year declined to respond.

The NSS is sent out annually to final-year undergraduate students across the country, and is designed to provide feedback on universities and the quality of courses offered, but this year a number of top institutions declined to take part in the voluntary data collection for the first time.

As part of the Government’s White Paper reforms to higher education, this year’s student satisfaction scores are to be used alongside graduate employment figures to determine teaching quality in universities – known as the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF).

Those that score highly will be granted permission to increase tuition fees for undergraduates above the current cap of £9,000 per year.

NUS leaders argue by giving feedback, students are forced to be compliant in the proposals. As a result, the union called on individual university unions to encourage members not to respond.

Along with Manchester – the biggest university by student population, with around 30,000 undergraduates – a number of Russell Group institutions including Sheffield, Oxford, Cambridge, University College London and Bristol declined to take part this year.

An NUS spokesperson said the fall in responses was indicative that students were not willing to be used as tools in the Government’s fee-hike plans.

NUS vice president for higher education, Amatey Doku said: “The Government wanted to use today’s NSS results to allow universities which scored highly to raise fees from £9,000 to over £10,000 by 2020 as part of their draconian reforms to higher education.

“Our membership made it clear to us that they found this unacceptable and demanded we campaign to sever any link between their crude Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) and a rise in tuition fees which would hit students hard.

“Figures released today demonstrate just how easily this data can be skewed and how unreliable they are as a measure of teaching quality within this framework. This serves as a reminder that students are opposed to soaring tuition fees and are ready to use their power to challenge any ill-thought changes to the sector which will ultimately see them losing out.

“We will continue to call for the link between fees and surveys like the NSS [to be broken] and engaging students’ unions across the country to do the same.”

Of the 530 higher education providers which did take part in the 2017 survey, 304,000 students submitted their responses – 68 per cent of those targeted.

In 2016, as many as 312,000 students took part from just 358 providers.

Of the 68 per cent eligible this year, 84 per cent said they were satisfied with the overall quality of their courses – a slight fall on last year (86 per cent).

Student satisfaction with teaching is high, with 85 per cent agreeing that teaching staff are good at explaining topics and that they feel intellectually stimulated and challenged.

Last year, only 2 per cent of respondents said they were strongly dissatisfied with their course overall.

Publishing the results of this year’s survey – undertaken for Hefce by Ipsos MORI – analysts declined to give details of the level of student dissatisfaction, however.

The higher education body emphasised that, as a result of changes to the study, this year’s figures could not be directly compared to previous years.

In terms of university breakdown, the University of Buckingham, came in joint first place with St Andrews and the Royal Vetinary College for overall student satisfaction.

Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said: “The NSS remains the voice of the UK’s students and Buckingham is thrilled to be top once again; we are very fortunate to have such great students and academics who clearly make learning at Buckingham such a success for all.

“It is a shame for students when considering their choices that some universities have not been included in this year’s results.”

Other elite universities expressed disappointment with the results.

Of the 460 institutions included in the “satisfaction” part of the questionnaire, 44 of them are listed as being significantly better than their benchmark – a score deemed to reflect the sector average satisfaction levels but adjusted to reflect the mix of students and subjects at the institution.

The figures showed 60 of the 460 were significantly worse than their benchmark.

Of those in the Russell Group of universities – considered the UK’s best institutions – two of the 16 included in the survey scored significantly worse than their benchmarks.

They are the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and Edinburgh University.

LSE interim director, Professor Julia Black said of LSE’s results: “Rigorous academic standards and independent critical analysis will continue to be an essential part of undergraduate education at LSE. However, it is clear that work is needed in order to improve our students’ overall experience.

“The School has already made a number of significant changes in the past year, including the opening of the new academic and personal development centre, LSE Life.

“We have also agreed to implement further changes to our assessment system and will be introducing in-year exam resits. All new developments have been made through working closely with students and in direct response to concerns they have raised.”

LSE was one of three Russell Group institutions (along with Liverpool and Southampton) to suffer under the Government’s new TEF rankings this year, achieving a bronze award – the lowest possible score.

The university achieved a 74 per cent student satisfaction rate this year, down from 81 per cent in 2016.

Many traditionally high-ranking universities are said to have fallen short in the TEF scores due to a lack of emphasis on student welfare and lack of diversity.

Responding to the results, Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of universities UK, said: “The new questions in this year’s survey and the boycott of the NSS in some universities makes year-on-year comparisons difficult.

“For this reason we would urge students and those who advise them on application decisions to take into account a range of information about institutions and courses. Ultimately there is no substitute for speaking to admissions officers, lecturers and current students to get a feel for the university and course.”

Universities minister Jo Johnson said: “While overall student satisfaction remains high, we know there is significant variation in teaching quality and outcomes both within and between providers.

“There is more to do to ensure that students and taxpayers investing heavily in our higher education system secure value for money from it.

“In the next phase of performance assessment, the TEF will focus on teaching and outcomes at subject level and we are also developing a powerful new teaching intensity metric informed by contact hours and class sizes.”

Professor Madeleine Atkins, HEFCE chief executive, added: “The NSS continues to be the largest and most authoritative survey of its kind in the UK.

“Its role in gathering crucial evidence about the student experience in higher education has been enhanced this year by new questions on student engagement and updated questions to reflect the latest approaches to learning and teaching.

“The 2017 results show that students provide particularly positive feedback on the quality of teaching and on learning opportunities. Institutions will also, however, be considering carefully how they can continue to improve assessment and feedback, and their broader engagement with students.”

A Russell Group spokesman said: “Collectively, Russell Group universities included in the NSS figures this year have continued to outperform the sector as a whole.

“Our universities continue to invest millions of pounds in improving the teaching, facilities and services available to our students.

“This is the first year that some of these questions have been asked as part of the NSS and the overall picture is complicated by the impact of the boycott pursued by the NUS.”

CLEARING 2017 GUIDE: HOW TO GET ON TO UNIVERSITY COURSES ON A-LEVEL RESULTS DAY

As A-level students across the country celebrate their results, universities are scrambling to fill vacancies left across thousands of courses this year.

Clearing not only allows universities and colleges to fill the places they have left on their courses, but it also allows those who have changed their minds, or who are yet to apply, to look at what other options are on offer.

It may be that you don't quite make the grades for your preferred course and need to find a vacancy somewhere else, but you might find you do even better than imagined and want to "trade up" your offer for one at a more suitable university or course.

Years ago, clearing was regarded as an option mainly reserved for those without offers, and involved hours of phone calls to busy helplines.

But now more so than ever it's a buyer's market - more than 41,000 courses were listed as having vacancies on results day in 2016, a figure that is expected to be even higher this year thanks to a fall in applications overall.

Here's how to go about the clearing process:

Start before results day

Clearing officially opens in July and will remain open until late September.

Whether you think you did brilliantly, failed, or fall somewhere in the middle, it doesn’t hurt to spend some time thinking about alternate universities and courses before results day proper.

Make sure you have your Ucas number and grades to hand, just in case you need to make some calls.

Ask for advice

Your school or college will likely have advisors standing by on results day for those who need questions answering. They can talk you through alternative courses and subjects before you start to look at Clearing itself.

Use Ucas Track

If you log into Track and haven’t met the requirements for your course, it will show a Clearing number. You’ll need this, as well as your personal ID, throughout the day when talking to universities, so make sure you know what it is.

You’ll know you’re in Clearing if your Track status says "You are in Clearing" or "Clearing has started".

See what’s available

There is an official vacancy list on the Ucas website. This is updated regularly, so if you don’t see the university or college course you’re looking for, check again later.

With this in mind, it might be worth ringing up the institution anyway (that's you - not your parents!) to see if they can offer you something over the phone.

Make a shortlist of courses you're considering to keep things simple and help you to remember different conversations.

Talk to the university or college you’re interested in

This phone call could just be a matter of confirming your grades to an administrator, but treat it like a mini-interview just in case. The university might just throw in some questions to test out your suitability for the course.

For this reason, it's wise to read up on the course beforehand to show your commitment.

Give them your Clearing number and your personal ID to allow them to see your application online. They might reconsider you (maybe for the same course) if you’ve applied to them earlier in the year.

Get informal offers over the phone - you can get more than one from a variety of different colleges and courses - and then decide which one you’d like to accept. If you have the time, the best way to see what a university or college is like is visiting to have a look around.

Add a Clearing choice in Track

Once you’ve had confirmation from a university and they’re happy to offer you a place, click ‘Add Clearing choice’ and fill in the course details by the date the university/college gave you over the phone.

This counts as you definitely accepting the offer so if they confirm, it’ll show as an acceptance on the choices page of Track and Ucas will send a confirmation letter.

You can only add one choice at a time, but if the university or college doesn’t confirm your place, you’ll be able to add another. Once you’ve been accepted at a university or college, you'll need to think about where you’re going to live and start applying for accommodation.

Don't rush your decision - you need to be happy with it for the next few years.

Don’t panic

​Alix Delany, head of admissions at the University of East Anglia, says: “All universities are very aware this is a big decision for you and you might not have expected to be in Clearing.

"Remember there will always be a friendly voice at the end of the phone line, and we are here to help you find the right course to match your interests.

“A little checklist of the things you would like to ask the university is worth having, so you can compare and contrast the different offers you might get.

"For example, if you want to live in university accommodation, am I guaranteed a room? How long is my offer guaranteed for? Where can I find out more about the course, and is there an opportunity to come and visit?”

Whether you are pleased or disappointed with your results, the best thing to do when going through the Clearing process is to stay calm and make an informed decision. Don't worry about what might have been - you could find a change of plan is your best decision yet.

STUDENT DENIED UNIVERSITY LOAN BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE HAS SAME NAME, BIRTHDAY AND BIRTHPLACE AS HER

A British student’s university loan application has been rejected because someone with exactly the same name, birthday and birthplace has already applied for one.

Emily Hughes, from Smethwick in the West Midlands, hopes to undertake a degree in medicine at Birmingham University next term.

Following her application, she was told by the Student Loans Company in April she could not be registered on the government loan system, however.

Another Emily Hughes who was born in the same area on the same day – 28 October 1998 – has already been registered on the system for a loan.

Speaking to the BBC, Ms Hughes, 18, said she had been left in an awkward position thanks to her doppelganger.

“It’s been chaos,” she said. “Just so much unnecessary stress and it's quite embarrassing as all my friends are sorted with their loans, but not me.”

The two Hugheses have not met, the prospective student said, adding: “I’d love to meet her, but at the same time, I wouldn’t.”

Ms Hughes is due to find out whether she has been accepted onto her preferred course on A level results day, 17 August.

Provided she achieves the required grades, she will then be expected to pay top-rate tuition fees of £9,250 in September.

“I am now currently living with the fear of not having the means to finance my prospective degree.

”I am appalled with the way this organisation functions.“

She has since posted her passport to the Student Loans Company, who said her application will be processed once they receive it.

A spokesperson said: “We apologise to Miss Hughes for any distress caused as a result of the delay in processing her student finance application.

”This was the result of a human error when transferring Miss Hughes' paper application to her online account.“

LET STUDENTS USE STUDY DRUGS AND LET’S SELL THEM AT BOOTS, SAYS CAMBRIDGE SCIENTIST

It’s safe to say that, from their early beginnings as prescription medication for narcoleptics and the odd productivity booster for enterprising pharmacology students, study drugs have now been integrated fully into modern student life.

In fact, a student article for the Bristol Tab says that they’ve become as much part of the university experience as “disappointing sex and watching too much daytime television”.

The statistics would support that: a nationwide survey showed that one in five students have used study drugs at UK universities, and the Oxford University student magazine Cherwell found that there it was more like one in four.

In response, Oxford University’s Student Union in April launched workshops on the safe usage of the drugs, telling Trinity College students in an email that they wanted to explore “the reasons why people might start using smart drugs, and suggest safe and sustainable solutions”.

But now, Cambridge Professor of Clinical Neuropsychology and global expert on cognitive-enhancing drugs, Dr Barbara Sahakian, argues that licensing study drugs to students might be a good idea.

“I think the Government should look at the front runner drug that people are using as a cognitive enhancing drug, and actually get together with the drug company and assess whether it’s safe and effective for people to use,” she told The Independent.

“If it is, then let them license it, and maybe sell it in Boots, and have people have the usual information about the side effects and then they can also go to their GP before they take it.”

Dr Sahakian’s research has spanned drugs like modafinil, which is the most popular in the UK, and Ritalin and Adderall, which have gained notoriety in the United States.

Her comments come as UK-based websites selling modafinil have been closed down by the UK Government, and campuses such as Duke University in North Carolina have banned them to prevent cheating.

Dr Sahakian thinks that the current system is dangerous for students, since when buying drugs online “you don’t know what you’re getting – it could be anything”.

“When you think about it, a lot of people what they do is really dose themselves with coffee and caffeine and then they end up with palpitations and tremors and things like that, so in some ways I prefer [Modafinil],” she said.

“There are many students who leave things rather late and try to cram for the exam and then want to take a drug to keep them awake and alert.”

“If they’re going to do it I’d rather ensure that they’re not harmed by it.”

In fact, she says, there might even be other places where study drugs would be worth using.

“There may be other contexts in which we want a better cognitive enhancing drugs – we know that people fall asleep at the wheel all the time when they’re driving.”

“Perhaps, if it’s a safe awake and altering agent, there might be a place for it.”

Dr Sahakian argues that although there have been reported cases of study drug use leading to anxiety and other mental health problems, the real risk is in “drug/drug interactions” and students “taking too much”.

“That’s why doctors telling you what dose to take are so important, rather than students taking someone else’s drug or buying the drug over the internet or whatever they’re doing.”

“If it was licensed, they could check the person out and say you haven’t got high blood pressure, you’re not on any other medication – that type of thing. And then they could come back to the doctor if they had a side-effect they were concerned about and the doctor could also advise them on the safe dose.”

The science seems to be behind it, and anecdotal evidence from students across the UK suggests that if all night essay crises are the problem, brain-boosting pills might now be the solution of choice.

But what are they actually like to use? The Independent spoke to some students about their experiences.

“I got a very good mark in my Prelims [first year exams], and I can put it basically entirely down to using modafinil, quite confidently,” said Chloe, an Oxford student.

“At the beginning of my first year of Oxford I got into a group of friends who were all quite druggy. The leader of the friendship group was very into ‘uppers’ – cocaine, Adderall, those kinds of drugs.”

“We got really into that and we thought it was really fun and we’d take it and go to lectures, and you know. We didn’t just use it for studying.”

The drugs give you an edge in the classroom, making you “so much more focussed”, according to another student, Tom. He says, “if I’m planning on spending a day in the library, then taking a modafinil ensures I’m going to be making the most of my time relatively distraction free.”

“I take it whenever the need is there, for upcoming deadlines, upcoming collections [college tests] or upcoming exams, possibly averaging a once or twice a week.”

For Jack, who studies Physics at Warwick, “it was a bit much the first time I took it because it was about eight hours, not even of just concentration but just completely immersed in what you were doing.”

“This for a lab report – in Physics you do six pages of an experiment that you’ve done, it’s quite tedious. It’s the sort of thing that would usually take me about a week or two to do properly, whereas this time I managed to sit through an entire day, and managed to get to over a week’s position on it in one day, purely because without that interest I couldn’t sit down and stay concentrated enough to do it.”

Chloe said that when she first used study drugs, “it wasn’t actually a very good essay but it just gave me the motivation to actually sit down and write something, which can be the hardest thing in the first place.

But after using modafinil every day for revision, she described the effects of going cold turkey over the summer holidays. “The thing about modafinil is that it also gives you incredible anxiety,” she says.

“In one of my exams I was on modafinil and I suddenly had a brain fog and I went into a panic attack – probably my first ever panic attack. And I almost put up my hand and left the exam hall, but I just got it together and wrote a terrible essay.

“As much as the drugs did help me do really well in my Prelims and get all my essays done and keep on top of everything in my first year, I also developed crippling anxiety.”

Jack worries that some of the people he sells the pills to might not be sensible in their usage. “From the age of 13, my friendship group has always been taking some sort of drugs, and I’ve always been the sensible person – I always seem to know how to not take it too far. For the rest of my friends that’s not the same.”

That was what got him into the drugs, but he soon realised there was some cash to be made from students and their famous inability to work to deadlines.

“I buy these from a website for about 70p each, and then the typical price I sell for is about £3, because I know that other people sell them too.

“It was quite easy for me to stretch beyond my friendship group or friends-of-friends, and say ‘oh you can sell these to friends for £2 each’, and they’re not getting a bad deal compared to what I buy them for.”

A quick internet search confirms that buying modafinil online costs about £20 for thirty tablets, and there are a variety of brands and online pharmacies that advertise their products as the best.

​Modafinil, as a “medicinal product”, is not covered by the UK’s 2016 Pyschoactive Substances Act, although many universities and students have attempted to ban study drugs because of the advantage they give their users.

Do students think they’re unfair?

No, says Jack – it’s only a small difference. “It’s quite like having a motivational coach. If your version of that is to be able to take a pill that helps you concentrate a bit more for a couple of hours then I wouldn’t say that was far enough of an advantage to complain about.”

Tom agrees. “The difference is that we’re not all in competition in academia. The point of sports is the competition, the point of our degrees are to educate us as individuals.”

A spokesperson for the University of Oxford said that “while we have yet to see truly convincing evidence that the use of cognitive enhancement drugs is a widespread problem at Oxford, we would strongly advise students against taking any drugs that have not been prescribed to them”.

ELITE UK UNIVERSITIES FOUND TO BE SECOND-RATE IN NEW GOVERNMENT RANKINGS

Britain's elite universities are failing to achieve teaching excellence, official rankings have revealed, as the Government publishes its first major assessment of teaching standards in higher education.

More than half of Russell Group institutions – traditionally considered to be the best in the country – did not score a gold rating after entering the new Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF).

Instead, a number of newer universities, including former polytechnics, have been awarded the highest standard in terms of teaching, learning and potential employment outcomes for students.

The University of Portsmouth, Coventry, De Montfort University and Bangor are among those awarded gold status, despite sitting further down in traditional university league tables.

Professor Dominic Shellard, vice chancellor of De Montfort, said the results illustrated “a real watershed moment for British universities”.

“To me, the TEF really demonstrates the passing of the old guard and the ushering in of a new hierarchy,” he told The Independent.

Overall, 295 universities, colleges and alternative education providers took part in the new ranking system, with 26 per cent gaining a gold award, 50 per cent rated silver and 24 per cent achieving bronze.

These figures exclude institutions that received a provisional award because there was not enough data for a full assessment.

Of the 21 Russell Group universities that took part, just eight (38 per cent) were given a gold rating, including Oxford and Cambridge; 10 (48 per cent) were awarded silver and three (14 per cent) achieved a bronze.

The Russell Group said it does not believe the TEF measures “absolute quality”, however, and that would-be students need clear guidance about what the results mean and how they should be used.

The TEF was introduced by the last government in a bid to gain more evidence about teaching and learning in UK universities, with proposals to link quality to tuition fee increases.

Universities that choose to enter are assessed on a range of measures, including student satisfaction, drop-out rates and whether students go on to employment or further study after graduating.

Differences between institutions, such as entry qualifications and subjects studied, were taken into account by an independent panel, which decided the final awards.

De Montfort University is one of 59 institutions to score gold under the new system.

The arts-based university ranks in 82nd place according to The Complete University Guide tables, and 70th place in the Times Higher Education Rankings for 2017.

“We’ve been rewarded for engaging with students more extensively,” said Professor Shellard.

“For a long time, league tables have assessed universities on their longevity and social standing, but I think the big thing about the TEF – which is what the Russell Group don’t like – is it takes into account the diversity of your applicants.”

“I think a lot of the top dogs will have to rethink their approach.”

A number of highly regarded universities have been criticised for their lack of diversity within undergraduate applications in recent years.

Last year, the former Prime Minister David Cameron accused Oxford University of “not doing enough to attract talent from across our country”, noting that the institution had accepted just 27 black British students in a single year.

Professor Shellard said the TEF awarding body had praised his university for having “outstanding support for students”, including a high ratio of student councillors and mental health support, as well as a high teaching standard.

“It’s quite clever of the Government to do this – they’ve recognised that people will really judge institutions on whether it’s worth them spending the tuition fees.”

A gold award means that a university is of the highest quality found in the UK, providing “consistently outstanding teaching, learning and outcomes for its students”, while the silver award was given for consistently exceeding “rigorous national quality requirements for UK higher education” and bronze was given to those that meet these national requirements.

Those awarded a bronze or higher – all institutions that took part besides those rated provisional – are now set to be able to raise tuition fees, which currently stand at around £9,000, in line with inflation in 2018/19.

Nick Hillman, Director of the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi), said the fact that some of the results seemed “suprising” suggests the TEF is working.

“The TEF would have comprehensively failed if it had simply replicated existing hierarchies,” he said. “It was always designed to do something different to other league tables and rankings – namely, to show where there are pockets of excellence that have been ignored and to encourage improvements elsewhere.

“I visit around 50 universities a year so know the gold ratings have been hard won by committed staff and students and are very well deserved.”

Of those institutions scoring gold, a small number are recognised for achieving top marks across all six assessment categories, including the University of Buckingham, which has been awarded with a “double positive” rating.

Sir Anthony Seldon, its vice chancellor, said: “For Buckingham, one of the country’s smallest universities, to come top in the country in the first ever TEF exercise is exceptional.”

“The TEF is an excellent and overdue exercise which will have a dramatic impact on improving the quality of teaching.

“But I think it is far from perfect and I think hard work needs to be done to improve the quality of the exercise so that it is a true and fair measure of teaching quality.”

Many reputable universities will be disappointed with their results, he added, since the framework is an “incredibly important tool” used by potential applicants overseas.

“The TEF is far from a perfect assessment of teaching and learning,” Mr Hillman added. “While it tells us a lot of useful things, none of them accurately reflects precisely what goes on in lecture halls.

“I hope university applicants will use the results in their decision making but they should do so with caution, not least because the ratings are for whole universities rather than individual courses.”

Madeleine Atkins, chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), which published the results, said: “Students currently invest significant amounts of time, and indeed money and incurring debt in their higher education. They are quite right to expect a high quality academic experience.”

The assessment “measures the things that students themselves say they really care about”, she said.

The three Russell Group universities to be handed a bronze award were the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), the University of Liverpool and the University of Southampton .

The acting director of the Russell Group, Dr Tim Bradshaw, said: “Our members provide an outstanding student experience where teaching is enhanced by access to world-class research and facilities.

“This is a trial year. We need to recognise that developing a robust TEF that is truly reflective of the UK's excellent higher education sector will take time.

“TEF does not measure absolute quality and we have raised concerns that the current approach to flags and benchmarking could have a significant unintended impact.

“Applicants need clear guidance about what TEF results mean and how they should be interpreted to aid decision-making.”

Universities Minister Jo Johnson said: “The Teaching Excellence Framework is refocusing the sector’s attention on teaching – putting in place incentives that will raise standards across the sector and giving teaching the same status as research.”

CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY EXAMINERS TOLD IT IS SEXIST TO USE THE WORD 'GENIUS' TO DESCRIBE STUDENTS

Cambridge University examiners have been warned against using words such as “flair”, “brilliance” and “genius” when assessing students’ work because they are associated with men, an academic has revealed.

Lucy Delap, a lecturer in British History at the top-ranking institution, said History tutors are discouraged from using the terms because they “carry assumptions of gender inequality”.

She told The Telegraph: “Some of those words, in particular genius, have a very long intellectual history where it has long been associated with qualities culturally assumed to be male.

“Some women are fine with that, but others might find it hard to see themselves in those categories”.

Dr Delap, who specialises in gender history, said one of the reasons why men get more first class degrees at Oxford and Cambridge than women is because female students struggle with the “male dominated environment”.

She pointed towards reading lists dominated by male authors and the lack of diversity seen in college portrait collections as examples.

Her comments follow a debate sparked by the Oxford University History Faculty this week, when the department was accused of sexism for introducing a “take home” exam paper.

The move was said to be part of a restructuring of the degree course, with the hoping of boosting results for female students who are statistically better performers at long term assessment over sit-down exams.

But some faculty members criticised the decision, warning that it risked implying that women are the “weaker sex”.

In order to help Cambridge University progress in terms of gender equality, Dr Delap said her department wanted to use language that was more “transparent”.

"We’re rewriting our first two years of our History degree to create a wider set of paper choices," she explained, "to make assessment criteria clearer, and to really try and root out the unhelpful and very vague talk of ‘genius’, of ‘brilliance’, of ‘flair’ which carries assumptions of gender inequality and also of class and ethnicity.“

NUMBER OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS CLAIMING SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS 'SOARS'

The number of university students requiring special consideration in exams due to mental health problems has soared in the past five years, new figures suggest.

A Freedom of Information request from The Times found special arrangements were put in place for 218 Cambridge University students last year – nearly three times the figure for 2011.

At Imperial College the number this year was 111, compared to just 11 five years previously, and 167 undergraduate students sitting exams at Sunderland University were granted the same help (previously 96).

Special consideration is granted on a cases-by-case basis for students whose work might have suffered as a result of extenuating circumstances – for instance, a family death or ill health.

This might mean students receive help with extra time to complete papers, are given second attempts at sitting an exam or are allowed to submit essays rather than entering an exam hall.

Student union leaders have warned of a growing mental health crisis within young people in schools and universities, with financial and academic pressures known to be common aggravators for depression and anxiety.

Around 200,000 pupils in state secondary schools, equating to around 11 per cent, received extra time for exams last year, a figure that is expected to rise this summer.

The proportion is much higher for those in fee-paying independent schools, where almost 20 per cent of pupils (27,000) received special circumstances for a variety of reasons.

Some academics claim the ease with which students can take extra time is irresponsible, however, leading to ingenuine requests that mean the concept has become something of a “joke”.

Frank Furedi, a former professor of sociology at Kent University and author of What’s Happened to the University? warned that the practice was becoming too widespread.

“A few decades ago it was only granted in very rare circumstances but it has now become like a joke,” he told The Times. “It means there are different rules for different people and that some people who work hard and just get on with it are effectively penalised.”

“There are genuine cases but you have examples like ‘Mary broke up with her boyfriend and he shouted at her about it and now she’s traumatised and can’t concentrate on her exams’,” he added.

A survey undertaken by the National Union of Students in 2015 suggested as many as 78 per cent of students had experienced mental health issues during the previous year.

More recently, data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) revealed that a record number of students had dropped out of courses early during the 2014-15 academic year as a direct results of mental ill-health.

The latest figures show Edinburgh University allowed 16 students to opt-out of giving oral presentations as part of their assessment last year.

In 29 cases, adjustments for mental health conditions meant that the undergraduate “would not be penalised for an inability to contribute in class and should not be asked to do so”. Two students were allowed an “alternative” to sitting exams.

At Newcastle University a student who had been battling with a gambling addiction was granted another exam sitting.

The boundaries for special consideration remain at the university’s discretion, leaving some cases unclear and dividing department opinion.

Sheffield University guidelines for supporting students with mental health difficulties state that requests to defer examinations should be considered “where the student finds that they are unable to face the prospect of exams”.

A report from Unite Students and the higher Education Policy Institute published last week found only 37 per cent of university applicants with a mental health condition have declared it, or intend to declare it, with their prospective university.

THREE-QUARTERS OF GRADUATES WILL NEVER PAY OFF THEIR STUDENT LOANS

Most graduates will still be paying off student loans into their 50s, and three-quarters will never clear the debt, a new probe has found.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) report said that initial gains made by poorer students in the controversial 2012 shake-up of the tuition fees system have been more than wiped out by subsequent changes.

The reforms brought in by the then Coalition government originally saw the lowest earning third of graduates better off by £1,500, but replacing maintenance grants with loans sent debt rates soaring.

The changes resulted in students from low-income families graduating with the highest debt levels of more than £57,000.

Expected repayments from the lowest-earning third of graduates have increased by about 30 per cent since 2012, while repayments by the richest third rose by less than 10 per cent.

“The combination of high fees and large maintenance loans contributes to English graduates having the highest student debts in the developed world,” the report states.

The probe said that interest rates on student debt were “very high” at up to 3 per cent above inflation.

The average student who borrows £45,000 ends up paying another £5,800 in interest, while higher earners may have to fork out £40,000 in interest repayments, the IFS found.

“There is a risk that better-off parents will pay fees up front, especially if they think their offspring will be high earners. This would increase the cost to government in the long run,” the study said.

The IFS found that low-cost arts and humanities subjects got much bigger increases in funding, 47 per cent, than high-cost science and engineering subjects, 6 per cent, between 2011 and 2017.

The report said: “Incentives for universities to provide high-quality courses in return for the money they receive are surprisingly limited.”

Changes to the system reduced annual government borrowing in the short run by nearly £6bn, and the financing of undergraduate education adds less than £1bn a year to public spending, the report said.

The moves have cut the long term cost to the taxpayer of higher education by around £3bn a year.

“This long-run saving is lower because outlay on student loans is not included in measures of public spending, and 31 per cent of the value of loans is not expected to be repaid,” the report said.

University funding has increased by about 25 per cent per student since 2011, primarily funded by richer graduates, and institutions now receive an average of £28,000 per student per degree.

The report stated: “Reducing tuition fees or bringing back maintenance grants would have the advantage of allowing government to target specific students or courses that have wider benefits to society. This would, however, significantly increase deficit spending and lead to a smaller, but still considerable, increase in the long-run government contribution.”
