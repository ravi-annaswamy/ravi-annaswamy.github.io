19 BEST WOMEN’S WINTER PYJAMAS

Some 90 per cent of us wear our pyjamas around the house before we get into bed. For the pyjama aficionados among us, that will come as no surprise: anyone who’s ever owned a truly cosy pair of PJs will know the feeling of rushing home to get out of uncomfortable work clothes and into a dreamy pair of jammies to relax in.

And pyjamas just keep getting better and better: in fact, they’re even now deemed acceptable to wear out of the house, with the “pyjamas by day” trend seeing a raft of celebrities and fashionistas donning their very best PJs and smartening them up with heels, clutch bags and blowdries.

We’ve gone on a hunt for the very best pyjamas for women this winter. We included a range of different pyjamas, from the snuggly sort you’d only wear around the house, to on-trend silk PJs that you can get away with at Fashion Week. We wore all the pyjamas, not just in bed but around the house and sometimes even out of the house, and considered a number of factors when judging them: their cosiness, their material, their value for money, and of course, how they looked.

We made sure to include a range of budgets, too, so that whether you want something cheap and cheerful to get you through this winter’s cold nights, or you want to blow the budget on something fabulous you can wear both to bed and to parties, we’ve got you covered.

Muji Side Seamless Flannel Pyjama: £39.96, Muji

From the moment we put them on, we couldn’t get enough of Muji’s heavenly Side Seamless Flannel Pyjamas.

Made of the very softest organic cotton, the pyjamas were wonderfully cosy to lounge around in and were extremely warm to snuggle into on cold winter nights. They come in five different colours so you can choose one to best fit your style, and considering just how soft and warm they are, are a steal at less than £40.

Rachel Riley Snow Scene Flannel Pyjamas: £99, Rachel Riley

The minute we touched Rachel Riley’s heavenly Snow Scene Flannel Pyjamas we were hooked. They tick all the winter pyjama boxes: the wonderfully soft cotton flannel makes them incredibly snuggly, they have an adorable vintage-style snow scene print, and they’re elasticated and stretchy for extra comfort. We also loved the attention to detail, from the smart blue pearl buttons and the simple white piping to the handy pockets.

It’s a great choice for mothers who want to match their little ones, as you can buy an adorable set for children, too.

Buy now

Dorina Cordelia Lace Trim PJ Set: Pants, £18, and Robe, £28, House of Fraser

For something a bit different, try Dorina’s Cordelia Lace Trim PJ Set, which we found to be great value and super comfy.

The loose-fitting trousers are perfect for low-maintenance lazing around, while we loved the robe style of the top, which added sophistication to the ensemble.

We were also big fans of the soft modal and elastane material, and we liked the lace edges, which took the look up a notch.

Buy now

Lavender Hill Clothing Lounge Set: £90, Lavender Hill Clothing

When we tried on Lavender Hill Clothing’s Lounge Set, we couldn’t quite believe how soft it was. Made of micro modal and elastane material, the set is super stretchy, with a lavender trim to add a pop of colour.

While we found the set incredibly comfortable to sleep and lounge about in, we think it wouldn’t look out of place in a yoga class or on a long haul flight either: it’s a great multi-functional set that looks and feels just as good in the house as out of it.

Buy now

Dagsmejan Stay Warm Sleepwear: Sleep Pants, £76, and Sleep Long Sleeve, £76, Dagsmejan

If a good night’s sleep is crucial for you, and you want some science to back up your forty winks, invest in a pair of pyjamas from Swiss-born, Swedish-designed brand Dagsmejan.

The brand works with sleep scientists and textile experts to take inspiration from high-performance sportswear and use tailored technology to create the perfect pair of pyjamas that help your body to regulate heat and moisture during the night.

While we might not be sleep scientists, we were seriously impressed by the brand’s Stay Warm Sleepwear, which despite being as light as a feather, kept us warm at night without ever feeling too hot or stuffy. The material is soft, cosy and seriously sleek.

Buy now

Stella McCartney Princess Blue Poppy Snoozing Long PJ Set: £169, Brand Alley

For a designer buy without the designer price tag, snap up this half-price Stella McCartney Princess Blue Poppy Snoozing Long PJ Set from Brand Alley.

The royal blue pyjama set is made from 100% silk and feels deliciously soft against the skin while you sleep.

We loved the luxurious, bold colour, as well as all the little designer details, such as the branded buttons on the shirt and the chic white piping throughout.

Buy now

Boux Avenue Julia Satin Wrap Pyjama Set: £45, Boux Avenue

A satin-look pyjama ensemble with an edge, we found Boux Avenue’s Julia Satin Wrap Pyjama Set to be a great value multifunctional buy.

While it of course makes a comfortable pyjama set ideal for wearing around the house or to bed, we found the eye-catching floral print and unusual wrap-front top perfect for wearing out of the house too, whether you wear the top with jeans or the trousers with a simple black or white top.

It’s a fun floral set that will work well in winter or summer.

Buy now Figleaves Camelia Soft Touch Button Through PJ Set: £60, Figleaves

For a simple, good value pyjama set that will last the test of time, opt for Figleaves’ Camelia Soft Touch Button Through PJ Set.

Made of cosy viscose, the pyjama top is full of luxurious details, from the contrast piping to the smart buttons, while the trousers are super-stretchy and perfect for lounging around in. It comes in three colours, but our favourite was the deep berry for a wonderfully wintery feel.

Victoria’s Secret The Satin PJ: £65, Victoria’s Secret

Victoria’s Secret might be best-known for their sexy catwalk show and revealing lingerie collection, but they can do cosy too. We loved their Satin PJ, which had a relaxed fit for lazing around in, and which was lightweight while still providing warmth.

We also loved the fact that as well as picking a pair in sizes XS to XL, you can also choose short, regular or long, great for those of us who are a bit shorter or taller than average. The pyjamas come in ten jazzy colours, and our favourite was the classic pink and white Victoria’s Secret stripes for a bold, candy-esque look.

Buy now Luxe + Hardy Sleep Set: Sleep Pants, £95, and Grandad Shirt, £95, Luxe + Hardy

Luxury brand Luxe + Hardy’s super-cosy collection is all about getting the best night’s sleep, with sleepwear that’s temperature controlling and breathable for the best possible slumber.

We adored the stripy Sleep Set, which wasn’t just comfortable to sleep in, but dreamy to lounge around in. The viscose mix jersey is thick and warm but still feels lightweight and flexible to make the perfect winter lazing material.

Buy now Bluebella Claudia Shirt & Trouser Cordovan: £38, Bluebella

For an affordable satin-look pyjama set, we liked Bluebella’s Claudia Shirt & Trouser Cordovan. We loved the deep plum colour, perfect for the winter months, and the smart piping on the collar, cuffs and pocket. It also comes in cream or black and is a wallet-friendly option if you want the elegant satin look without the price tag.

Buy now

Blackspade Ladies Luxurious Two-Piece Pyjama Set: £62.95, Blackspade

In dark blue tartan, Blackspade’s Ladies Luxurious Two-Piece Pyjama Set is an ideal choice for women who want a snuggly, traditional pair of pyjamas. Made from a cotton and modal fabric, the pyjamas are stretchy and cosy, and manage to be simultaneously breathable and warm.

We loved the slightly fitted aspect of these pyjamas, making them a good choice for wearers who prefer a bit of shape to their loungewear rather than being swamped in material.

Buy now

Totes Ladies Novelty Pyjama Set: £15, Totes Isotoner

Totes Isotoner’s fun Ladies Novelty Pyjama Set arrives in a lovely box perfect for Christmas gifting. The stretchy jersey trousers are covered with adorable polar bears, but our favourite part was the short-sleeved top, which is emblazoned with a giant polar bear in a fluffy material. It’s a great affordable treat and an ideal present for a winter-obsessed friend.

Buy now

Jockey Supersoft Pyjama Set: Relaxed Supersoft Pants, £38, and Supersoft Lounge Longsleeve Shirt, £30, Jockey

If you don’t like feeling swamped in heavy pyjamas but still want to feel cosy and covered up when you go to sleep, get a pair of Jockey’s Supersoft Pyjamas. The modal and elastane material is lovely and light while still providing warmth, and the fitted style is a nice alternative to loose, relaxed pyjamas with no shape. We also liked the contrasting look of the plain top and printed bottoms, which can, depending on your preference, feel smarter than a matching set.

Buy now

Cyberjammies Evelyn Woven Blue Fan Print Long Sleeve Pyjama Set: £48, Cyberjammies

We loved Cyberjammies’ Evelyn Woven Blue Fan Print Long Sleeve Pyjama Set, which, with its elegant print, smart lace inserts and cute trim, looks three times the price it actually is. As well as all the chic details, we also liked the comfortable cotton and modal material, which was breathable and lightweight, a good choice for those who feel trapped in bulky pyjamas.

A great value option for wearers who want their pyjamas to be stylish and comfortable without compromising on price.

Buy now

Phoebe Grace Yellow Cactus Pyjamas Set: Hettie Trousers, £175, and Mabel Shirt, £195, Phoebe Grace

If you’ve jumped straight on board the “sleepwear as daywear” trend, look no further than luxury silk leisurewear brand Phoebe Grace and the very chic Yellow Cactus Pyjamas Set. It’s certainly pricey, but the 100% silk material is delightfully soft, and we loved the bright, bold cactus print.

While the pyjamas make beautifully decadent sleepwear, we think they’re perfect for a bold look out of the house, too: start off with the Mabel Shirt paired with a simple pair of black jeans to ease yourself into the look, and then make heads turn by wearing the set together to a dinner party.

Buy now

EVA Winter Beauty Pyjama Set: Hemmed Trousers, £53, and Hooded Top, £53, EVA

For a pyjama set that you can unashamedly wear on the school run, our choice would be EVA’s Winter Beauty Pyjama Set. Coming in two colours, graphite or soft apricot, this pyjama set is designed for those who love to wear relaxed gear all day long, not just when it’s time for bed.

The hooded top is lightweight and cosy while still providing all the warmth you need for cold winter nights, and looks just as good with jeans as it does with pyjama trousers: we wore it out and about and got plenty of compliments. The trousers are equally cosy, and when paired together with the hoodie, make a snuggly, chic ensemble, perfect for those of us who are always cold.

Buy now

Lux Fix At Last Silk Devore Pink Pyjamas: £189, Lux Fix

At Last’s Silk Devore Pink Pyjamas are a great choice for both daywear and sleepwear: soft enough to lounge around in, but sturdy enough to wear during the day, we found the set to be a cosy, on-trend option for both wearing at home and out and about.

If you’re not brave enough to wear a full-on pyjama look out of the house just yet, we found both the top and bottom worked well with regular clothes for easy mixing and matching. They also come in a smart matching bag for chic storage.

Buy now

Lands’ End Women's Cotton Modal Pyjama Set: £45, Lands’ End

If it’s simplicity, softness and style you’re after, Lands’ End’s Women's Cotton Modal Pyjama Set will do the trick nicely. The cotton, modal and lycra material is lightweight, soft and stretchy without being bulky, while there are plenty of details to admire, from the subtle scalloped trim on the top to the bold print on the bottoms.

It comes in a range of colours with varying prices, and you can also buy a matching dressing gown if you fall in love with the bold print.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best women’s winter pyjamas

For great value cosiness and warmth, we loved the soft feel of Muji’s Side Seamless Flannel Pyjamas.

We also loved EVA Winter Beauty Pyjama Set for its comfortable and multifunctional separates. If you have a bit more to spend, we’d splash out on Rachel Riley’s Snow Scene Flannel Pyjamas, which were super snuggly in flannel while also incredibly cute with their vintage design.

9 BEST CAFETIERES

The French press, or cafetière, is a coffee brewing device invented at the end of the 19th century. Once regarded as an object of opulence, now cafetières are commonplace in most homes.

Jonathan Wadham, Rombouts’ Coffee Expert explains: "Cafetières are a great way to make consistently delicious coffee, easily and without lots of expensive equipment. Start with whole beans and grind fresh where possible, otherwise use a quality pre-ground coffee. I would always recommend using a simple recipe to make your coffee, mine is 60g of coffee for every 1 litre of water. Fill your cafetière with boiling water to pre-heat it. Once it’s well heated, empty the water and boil the kettle with fresh, ideally filtered, water. Once boiled, leave for around 30 seconds so as not to scorch the coffee.

Weigh out the coffee then place in to your cafetière. Add boiled water, making sure you soak all the dry coffee. Place the plunger lid back on the cafetière – but DO NOT PLUNGE! Wait four minutes. Lift the lid and with a spoon gently stir the coffee so the grounds sink to the bottom. Then using the spoon remove as much of the floating grounds and foam at the top of the coffee, place the plunger back on the cafetière, plunge gently and serve.

If your coffee tastes too burnt or bitter, try grinding the beans slightly coarser or using a little less coffee. If it tastes too weak or thin, grind slightly finer or increase the amount of coffee. And don’t forget the used coffee grounds are great in the compost heap or in the garden to help keep slugs at bay!"

Cafetière designs have evolved over the years and become varied in construction and style. We’ve put some of the best cafetières to the test. Each was tested over a week, during which time multiple cups of coffee were made with it. The cafetières were compared by aesthetics, how easily and effectively they made coffee, and their cost.

Coffee Studio French Press: £48, Royal Doulton

This dipped-grey glazed porcelain cafetière is the biggest tested, with a capacity of 1560ml it made 4-5 decent-sized mugs of coffee. Thus making it perfect for group get-togethers rather than lone coffee-drinking. It’s dishwasher and microwave safe (although it was too tall to fit in our tester’s microwave!). Being made of porcelain meant it kept coffee warm for longer than the glass cafetières and it poured and filtered nicely.

The lid was nice and heavy and fitted securely onto the top, making plunging easier. It also comes in a quirky folded carton bag which makes it a good gift option.

Buy now

Stellar 3 Cup Matt Double Wall Insulated Cafetiere: £36.75, Harts of Stur

This "unbreakable" stainless-steel design makes it perfect for people desiring a hard-wearing and durable cafeteria. Our tester thought it was definitely a plus-point, especially if you’ve got young children running around who are likely to knock things over. It’s compact, neat and dishwasher safe. You can get spares for the filter too so this cafetière really can last forever.

The double insulated wall meant that it kept coffee warm for a couple of hours and wasn’t too heavy to lift even when full. Don’t be confused by the fact it’s described as "3-cup" though, this translates as 325ml, which is actually the size of an average mug.

Buy now

Portland 8-cup Cafetière: £19, Marks & Spencer

The glass and metal combination creates a contemporary minimalist look which will go with any kitchen. Available in three different coloured lids, the copper one that we tested was more matte in appearance than the Jasper Conran cafetière of a similar design. This cafetière has an added splash guard which is handy for when you’re plunging it, and meant there weren’t any splashes when carrying it. It comes with a coffee scoop too, and is lightweight and effective – filtering coffee well.

Buy now

La Cafe Monaco Cream 8 Cup Cafetière: £17, Dunelm

This vintage cream framed cafetière provides a modern twist on traditional stainless-steel designs. The built-in strainer attached to the lid meant that there were never any stray grains escaping into our tester’s mug. It feels stable and not likely to topple, and being an 8-cup cafetière means that it holds 1000ml of water so is perfect for coffee mornings or group gatherings.

It comes with a scoop and is extremely cost-effective. Don’t be put off by the fact it’s not dishwasher safe, it was easy to rinse out with water after use.

Buy now

J by Jasper Conran Glass Copper Top French Press Cafetière: £20, Debenhams

Sleek, minimal and stylish. The shiny copper-top gives this cafetière a cutting-edge vibe. It’s incredibly lightweight and easy to clean, although the glass doesn’t keep the coffee warm for as long as some of the other cafetières tested. It poured nicely and filtered the coffee well so there were no unwanted stray grains seeping through.

Buy now

Cafetière Coffee Press 3 Cup: £13.99, Lakeland

A more traditional looking cafetière, this sits well on four stainless steel feet. The handle is easy to hold and although it can’t be used on top of an oven it is dishwasher safe and made from toughened glass. Our tester found the lid fitted nicely so there was no mess when plunging. No-frills, traditional in design. Don’t be confused by the ‘3-cup’ description, this makes one mug so it’s perfect for a quick morning coffee for one.

Buy now

Stoneware Cafetière With Metal Press: £55, Le Creuset

Made from stoneware, this gorgeous marine-coloured cafetière combines the trusted Le Creuset quality with the practicalities of modern life – it’s oven and dishwasher safe and doesn’t have any fiddly crevices so it’s really easy to clean. Available in a whole range of colours, it comes with a 10-year warranty which gives peace of mind if you’re concerned about the cost. It feels stable and sturdy to use and makes about two and a half mugs.

When full it’s quite heavy to lift but it pours nicely and filters the coffee well. It also keeps the coffee warm for longer than glass alternatives.

Buy now

Whittard Copper 8-cup Cafetière: £30, Whittard

This is a brand which has been dealing in coffee since 1886, when Walter Whittard opened his first shop. The shiny copper finish gives this cafetière a contemporary twist, whilst the shape and engraved logo reminds us of the trusted Whittard quality. It comes with a coffee scoop and has a capacity of 1000ml, making it an ideal option for a coffee-morning or relaxing long breakfast.

The handle is easy to grip and it feels steady on its feet. The lid fits securely and stays on well and it provides a very smooth plunge and smooth, grain-free coffee.

Buy now

La Cafetière Pisa French Press Coffee Marker: £20, Wayfair

This quirky red design makes the cafetière fun and eye-catching, and it’s also available in more traditional chrome or gunmetal grey. We tested the 350ml size (which makes one cup), but it’s also available in 1litre size too. Light, stable and bright, it’s a delight to use.

The soft-touch black handle allows easy grip, and black base makes it sturdy on even the shiniest of surfaces. It comes with a handy coffee scoop too.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best cafetières

For a large French Press look no further than the Royal Doulton which is ideal for group get-togethers or lazy mornings. Stylish and with the capacity to make four or five mugs of coffee, the stoneware construction keeps the coffee warmer for longer than glass alternatives. The lid fits well and it’s not too heavy to lift when full.

A brilliant smaller cafetière is the Stellar 3-cup insulated Cafetière from Harts of Stur. Sleek and durable, it’s a perfect coffee-for-one go-to. The fact it feels like it will last for years makes the price tag extremely justifiable. If you’re looking for a more cost-effective all-rounder, the Marks & Spencer Portland 8-cup Cafetière is contemporary, lightweight and easy to clean.

The numbered festive box counts down to Christmas with a delectable handmade chocolate each day; the 25 exotic and seasonal flavours include Tawny Port & Fig, Guava and Coconut Truffle, and Fizzy Pudding on the 25th. Our favourites are the Kumquat Twist and Dorset Salted Caramel, but they’re all delicious.

The award-winning Dorset company’s chocolates are so fresh, made with local cream, that the calendar is delivered at the end of November, and should be stored in the fridge.

The vegan ones are clearly marked.

Upstanding Advent Calendar: £55, Charbonnel et Walker

This calendar is one to keep on the mantelpiece. Charbonnel et Walker has been creating its creamy chocolates since 1875, and the Victorian Miniature Paper Theatres theme and opulent gold numbering of their 2018 calendar are a nod to the chocolatier's heritage.

Open the drawers to reveal delicious full-size chocolates from fudge to violet creme, each housed in a white box – a little Christmas parcel to open each day.

Keep the stunning calendar and refill the drawers each year.

There’s true surprise factor in opening the windows which reveal treats as varied as packets of seasonal flavoured chocolates (Cinnamon Buns), a smooth vegan Hazelnut Bûche, crackers filled with pecan praline, Salted Caramel Vodka, and award-winning Cocoa Gin.

There are treats for every family member here, and there’s plenty to share.

Green & Black’s Advent Calendar: £10, Waitrose

What this calendar lacks in exciting festive design, it makes up for with a generous 238 grams of high quality chocolate.

New this year, Green & Black’s first advent calendar looks much more expensive than it is. It contains miniature, wrapped versions from the Praline and Velvet Edition ranges including milk and dark, salted caramel infused dark chocolate, 70 per cent, and sea salt dark chocolates.

Divine Dark Chocolate Advent Calendar: £5, Divine

GAIL’s advent calendar: £18, GAIL’S

This advent calendar may be understated with its line drawings of houses and churches, and muted shades, but the chocolates are nothing ordinary.

A collaboration with Melt chocolatiers in London’s Notting Hill, the 24 chocolates are bespoke creations using breadcrumbs from the luxury bakery’s signature French dark sourdough that are caramelised and folded into dark and milk chocolate. And they’re really very moreish.

For the sweet-toothed, Carluccio’s compact advent calendar is filled with creamy giandujas.

The foil wrapped festive characters and woodland animals will appeal to the young and old.

Lindt Excellence Advent Calendar: £12, Amazon

This is the least Christmassy of all our choices, so if you’re more interested in indulging in a daily chocolate – and you’re a dark chocolate fan – this one is for you. It is also ideal for couples since there are two fine Swiss chocolates behind every window (except for the 24th, when there are double rations).

The surprise factor is in not knowing which of the four dark chocolate flavours – plain, orange, mint, and sea salt – will be behind each window.

With 275g of chocolate, it’s good value, too.

The Verdict: Best chocolate advent calendars for adults

For the true connoisseurs, you can’t beat the intense flavours, or freshness, of Chococo’s handmade chocolates. But for variety, and taste, design, and excitement factor, we are also fans of Artisan du Chocolat’s option and Hotel Chocolat’s enormous Grand Advent which is a feast fit for sharing among the whole family and with friends.

If you’re looking for a calendar that will stand out on the mantelpiece as part of your Christmas decorations, Charbonnel et Walker’s will look beautiful even once its delicious contents have been demolished, and Prestat’s Snowman Calendar is jolly and doesn’t need to be propped up.

For excellent value, we love Carluccio’s and Green & Black’s.

10 BEST CHRISTMAS PUDDINGS

Ever wondered why Christmas pudding is known as plum pudding, despite its lack of plums? It’s because the word ‘plums’ before Victorian times referred to raisons. We love the flavours of a good Christmas pudding: dried fruits (and often nuts), flavoured with spices and held together by egg and suet (or vegan alternatives). You should expect a good kick of alcohol, too.

There are variations, of course, and our roundup has something for everyone, including vegetarians and vegans.

We tested many more puddings than wound up in this list, judging on aroma, appearance, texture and taste. Here are the ones that made the final cut.

Fortnum & Mason King George Pudding, four sizes: from £12.95, Fortnum & Mason

As rich and full-bodied as its namesake, this pudding is packed to the brim with top notch ingredients like chewy Turkish sultanas and crunchy Marcona almonds, along with heaps of good cognac and navy rum.

Not one for vegetarians, it has beef suet to bind it together – something that will appeal to the traditionalists.

It feels decadent and sticky – the kind of pudding a past generation would have made and stuck a sixpence in.

There are several sizes – we tried the biggest, which serves 10-14 and would be great if the rallies are descending on you.

You can use the ceramic bowl again afterwards.

Buy now

Tesco Finest 12 Month Mature Christmas Pudding, 907g: £8, Tesco

The first thing you’ll notice about this dome-shaped pudding is it’s darker than most, hinting at the richness that lies within.

It went down a treat among our testers, with not a crumb left, thanks to the abundance of cherries, pecans and almonds, which give a bit more crunch than most Christmas puddings while still keeping things moist, fruity, spicy and alcoholic.

The cider and sherry keeps things on the stronger side – all the better for it, in our opinion, but one to avoid if you wince at too much liquor.

Stick carefully to the cooking times as the outer part can dry out otherwise.

Buy now

Riverford Vegan Christmas Pudding, 450g: £11.95, Riverford

No need for the vegans to miss out with this delectable Christmas pud from Riverford, which substitutes butter for coconut oil and generously feeds four.

There’s no shortage of vine fruits and spices, with the apple flavours coming through more intensely than with other puddings. It still tasted on the lighter side.

Non-vegans shouldn’t be disappointed either.

We thought it tasted better steamed the traditional way than microwaved.

Buy now

Marks & Spencer The Collection 12 Month Matured Vintage Christmas Pudding, 907g: £14, M&S

Christmas pudding should be rich and indulgent and have the right balance of juicy fruit, warming booze and an appealing mix of sweetness and spice. This ticks all those boxes, with a smell so good that you can expect several shouts of, “Is it nearly ready?”.

The brandy and citrus are the most identifiable flavours, although they don’t dominate at the expense of all the other goodies.

Not too dry and not too sodden, it also has a good traditional texture.

Your only decision is what to have with it – our vote goes to a dollop of brandy butter or cream.

Buy now

Figgy’s Christmas Pudding, three sizes: from £11.95, Figgy’s

Made by husband-and-wife team Richard and Joanne Evans from their small Devon bakery, this vegetarian and sweeter-than-most pudding is one of the most aromatic we tried, with no scrimping on the ripe fruits that include raisins, sultanas and orange.

The packaging stands out, too – available in three sizes, each is presented in a Mason Cash ceramic bowl and then wrapped in cotton pudding cloth so the puddings can breathe and the flavours mature.

There are strict instructions not to put it near the microwave, so you’ll need to start steaming it before you sit down for your meal.

Buy now

Heston from Waitrose Golden Delicious Pudding, 800g: £14, Waitrose

You can always count on Heston Blumenthal to delight and surprise and this Christmas pud doesn’t disappoint. It has a gooey, candied, boozy centre that’s spills out honey and apple brandy sauce to moisten the rest of the pudding.

While all this might sound very sweet, the spices – notably cloves and cinnamon – keep things balanced.

It looks striking too, thanks to the gold topping, but you’ll need to like a serious alcoholic kick. This pudding is best served with pouring or whipped cream.

Buy now

Betty’s Christmas Pudding, three sizes: from £6.50, Betty’s

Betty’s flat-topped classic Christmas Pudding has been a bestseller for years. We’ve seen queues at this Harrogate baker for their delicious puddings. We have to admit to ordering online this year.

Expect plump, juicy fruits, plenty of nuts and a generous sprinkling of spices, all topped off with lashings of brandy and Yorkshire ale. Matured for six months, they come in a lovely box that makes them a nice gift.

Dark, indulgent and incredibly tasty, this pudding is on the smoother side.

Buy now

Selfridges Selection Artisan Christmas Pudding, 800g: £24.99

With the iconic Selfridges yellow bow, this pudding would make a great gift – and is ideal if you’re asked to bring pudding to your festive dinner.

It’s on the spicy side – which comes through in both the smell and taste – and is wonderfully rich. The boozy hit comes from the stout and dark rum.

Beautifully sticky, almost gooey, it will be a hit all round.

Buy now

Aldi Specially Selected Salted Caramel Vodka Pudding, 750g: £6.99, Aldi

The fruit in this Christmas pudding has been soaked in salted caramel vodka. Cider, brandy and rum have then been added. It’s surprisingly light, and we loved the caramel and vodka – it made an unusual and welcome change. We also found the fruit to be particularly plentiful.

It’s a thumbs up from us if you’re after something a bit different.

Buy now (in store only)

Cole’s Connoisseur Christmas Pudding, 454g: £8.49, Tiptree

Nut lovers, rejoice. This vegetarian-friendly option has all the qualities you’d hope for in a top-notch Christmas pudding, but with sweet ground almonds standing out in the aroma as it’s cooking and the flavour, giving a soft marzipan, almost cake-like feel.

And while that keeps things lighter than usual, there are satisfyingly crunchy nuts mixed in with the succulent fruits, all topped off with a tipple of cognac.

It looks good, too – glossy and chestnut brown in colour and a flat-topped shape that doesn’t fall apart when you turn it out ready to serve.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best Christmas puddings

Fortnum & Mason has come up trumps with its magnificent and long-time bestselling King George Pudding, which comes in sizes to suit all occasions.

For a less pricey option, we’d go for Tesco Finest 12-Month Mature Christmas Pudding, which is bursting with fruit, spice and booze.

Bloodborne is perhaps the most challenging video game in years. Set in the dark, gothic world of Yharnam, the game sees you adopting the role of a hunter.

12 BEST EYE MASKS

We spend approximately a third of our lives asleep. If only it was always dark when we tried to take a nap, and if only we were free from distractions. Sleep masks, however, can help.

Going to sleep in the dark should help you drift off as bright lights suppress melatonin (the hormone that makes us feel sleepy), stimulating sunlight and making you feel awake.

Here, we put some of the best sleep-masks to the test. All of them were worn for at least three nights and compared on the basis of how effectively they blocked out the light, how aesthetically pleasing they were, their comfort, usability, if they were good value, and if they helped the wearer achieve the holy grail of a good night’s sleep.

Dog Gel Eye Mask: £5, Neon Sheep

Don’t be fooled by the appearance of this mask because hiding behind the cheeky dog face is the most ingenious concept. Sandwiched between a soft polyester fabric backing and a plastic outer layer is a layer of gel beads. This allows the mask to be warmed up or cooled down, depending on your preference.

To warm it up, just place in the microwave for 10 seconds, and if it’s not warm enough, another ten seconds. Then lie back and use the Velcro-fastening elastic strap to secure it in place while you enjoy the warmth of the mask to help soothe you off to sleep (which was quicker than the time it took for the mask to cool down in our tester’s case).

Alternatively, if you need refreshing, simply place the mask in the fridge or freezer before you want to use it (being sure to check that the beads are still pliable and not frozen). Then use it as a cooling eye mask.

This mask provides 100 per cent blackout, and the black fabric means that it doesn’t show up make-up marks. Quirky and fun, our tester had to fight to get it back from her children who loved the bead texture and dog design.

The mask can be reused again and again, and once you’ve fallen asleep wearing it you’ll struggle to be without it.

Amara X ES Bee Eye Mask – charcoal: £20, Amara

Designed by Elizabeth Scarlett and exclusive to Amara, this grey cotton eye mask feels considerably thicker and harder-wearing than some of the others on the market. The sumptuous soft grey fabric is embroidered in the most beautiful gold bees and it comes in a stylish grey pouch which is also adorned with gold.

The elasticated strap feels like it would withstand many uses, and the velvet reverse provides a mole-like softness.

Filled with lavender, the scent is relaxing and not overpowering, and the mask is incredibly beautiful and yet effective too, blocking out light completely. The stylish pouch makes it a perfect gift or an ideal mask for taking on holiday.

Buy now

Aroma Home Cream Faux Fur & Satin Lavender Eye Mask: £12.95, Heat Treats

This mask is nicely packaged for a gift and made of incredibly soft faux fur. The inside of the mask feels like silk, but is 100% polyester, and when you put it on it has a gorgeous, yet not overpowering, lavender scent.

While the pale-coloured fabric means that it shows up any makeup marks easily, it can be cleaned with a damp sponge.

Our tester found that it let in a little bit of light around the bottom of the nose area but not enough to prevent sleeping.

Buy now

Orihea Contoured Eye Mask: from £6.99, Sleep Eye Mask

What makes this different to all the others is the fact that it’s a 3D Contoured Eye Mask. This means that the memory foam is shaped so that it doesn’t touch your eyelashes or eye. This makes it perfect for a quick daytime nap during which you want your make-up to remain in tact, but also ideal for anyone who doesn’t like the sensation of their eyes being touched by a mask.

For our testers it blocked out 100% of the light, and the thick elasticated band is secured with hidden Velcro so it didn’t get tangled in long hair. It comes with a handy pouch and set of earplugs too to guarantee ultimate sleep satisfaction!

Buy now

Spacemasks: £15 for a box of 5, Spacemasks

Social media is in a frenzy for these masks. They’re self-heating and boast of being able to ‘transport you to another dimension – relieving tiredness, eye strain and many other Earthly tensions’. They come in a box of five individually sealed masks.

Within seconds of opening one of the pouches and putting it onto your eyes, we could feel the mask start to slowly heat up. Apparently, this is due to the the oxygen molecules in the atmosphere ‘cuddling up’ to the mask’s iron particles in a natural heat exchange. It’s a very strange sensation to feel your eyes getting warmer as you lay there, but it’s perfect for these cold winter nights.

The masks are meant to stay warm for about 15 minutes, but our testers were always sound asleep by the time they cooled down. The only downside is the heating-up aspect isn’t reusable so once they’ve been used once, whilst they can still be reused as a normal mask, they feel a bit ridged and don’t heat up.

Upon opening one of the packets the two tear-shaped patches inside are quite slimy but stick to the skin well and can be used under the eyes to target puffiness, wrinkles and dark circles, or at the side of the mouth for nose-to-mouth crows feet. They felt very cold when initially applied but after a few minutes the tester forgot they were there. After ten minutes the patches can be removed and the sleep mask put on.

This bedtime routine felt very relaxing, and although there was no visible difference in wrinkles after just one day, after three days the testers eye area looked fresher and healthier. Together this set created a relaxing sleep experience, with an added bonus of improving the appearance of skin around the eyes. And of course the soft, silky mask can be used long after the patches have been used up.

If you’re looking for something purely functional for daytime napping or on flights, the Orihea Contoured Eye Mask from Sleepeyemask.co.uk was ideal. Although it’s not particularly sumptuous, the fact that it doesn’t touch your eyes and provides total black-out is perfect for anyone wanting to block out all distractions whilst keeping their make-up intact.

11 BEST MEN'S CYCLING OVERSHOES FOR AUTUMN AND WINTER

Along with gloves and base layers, overshoes are unsung heroes of autumn and winter cycling. Cold and wet feet will take all the fun out of a ride, but you can fight back thanks to modern fabrics that keep out wind and rain. As well as keeping your toes toasty, overshoes will help protect your cycling shoes from salt and grime thrown up from the road. We’ve found an amazing selection – from totally waterproof versions aimed at professional riders to eye-catching high-viz ones that will help to keep you seen and safe. You can make your shoes extra water-resistant by covering up any air vents in the soles of your shoes with duct tape during the winter months.

Sportful Neoprene All Weather Booties: £40, Wiggle

These booties are beauties – superbly stitched together and with some thoughtful details such as the handy puller at the heel to help you haul them into place over your boots. There’s a reflective stripe down the that will show up in oncoming headlights, while under the toes is a large protective panel to keep the weather out of any front air vents in your shoes. Fully waterproof and windproof, they will see you through anything the winter throws at you but you’ll find them too toasty for use in milder weather.

Buy now

SPATZ Pro Overshoes: £79.99, Spatzwear.com

These are the business – calf-length fully waterproof neoprene protectors that will keep your feet dry in conditions Noah would think twice about venturing out in. At twice the price of a pair of decent “ordinary” overshoes you’d expect them to be something special… and they certainly are.

They look a nightmare to pull on, but it’s a cinch once you get your head around it. You ease them on over your socks and leggings before putting on your shoes and stretching the toe and heel sections into place. To finish, you just do up the Velcro sole strap. Former pro rider Tom Barras came up with the idea for them in 2006 but then put the design to one side for 10 years until the technology to create them commercially came along.

Countless prototypes had input from fellow racers, top-level triathletes and even special forces veterans, and they have been tested in the toughest weather the Yorkshire Dales can throw at them. If you’re the sort of rider who has to be out training for hours at a time in all weathers, then these are game-changers.

Buy now

Pearl Izumi Pro Barrier WxB Road Shoe Cover: £31.99, Cyclestore

Hate zips? Then you’ll love these attention-grabbing covers. A Velcro-style hook and loop closure at the rear lets you open them up really wide to make pulling them over your shoes. The fluorescent-yellow versions should really grab the eyes of drivers as you pedal, but there are black versions for those who prefer to keep a lower profile. They have a rubbery outer coating to keep the rain out, with a fleecy lining to keep the warmth in, and are designed for use at temperatures between 10 and zero degrees.

Buy now

Prendas Windtex Overshoes: £19.99, Prendas

This pair were the only ones in our tests with a full-length hard rubber sole. It makes them a little fiddlier to fit but once you have eased the cut-out section into place around your cleats it makes for an effective extra barrier against road spray. They’re not waterproof but the Windtex fabric keeps your tootsies lovely and warm on dry but chilly days. At under £20, we think they’re a real steal

Buy now

Lusso Windtex Stealth Vision Over Boots: £30, Lusso

If you ever find yourself invited into an overshoe fitting contest, then this is the pair to take along. They’re super-stretchy, meaning you can have them on and zipped up within seconds. The combination of yellow and black stripes is great for visibility on the road and they are both windproof and water resistant. There’s a decent zip at the rear with a nice big puller you’ll appreciate on cold days when your fingers are going numb.

Buy now

Altura Thermostretch 3 Overshoe: £39.99, Evans Cycles

A no-nonsense pair that uses extra-thick neoprene to keep your feet warm and hold light rain at bay while you pedal. They’re nice and stretchy, so very easy to get on, and there are rubberised sections at the heel and toe so you don’t wear them away walking to and from your favourite café stop. A quality zip with a Velcro closure keep them securely in place and there is reflective detailing on the sides to catch car headlights.

Buy now

Proviz Reflect360 Waterproof Overshoes: £39.99, P roviz Sports

Commuting at dawn or dusk, or out training at night? Then check out these from reflective wear specialists Proviz. The silver/grey fabric contains millions of tiny glass beads which become amazingly bright when caught in headlights or street lights, so even the dopiest drivers should spot you. The black fabric on the insides is really stretchy, making them easy to pull on and off. They’re waterproof, but the fabric is quite thin so they’re not particularly warm and you might need thicker socks in the coldest months.

Buy now

Gore Wear C5 Windstopper Thermo Overshoes: £59, Wiggle

Some people find it irritating having a zip up the back of their ankles. Gore has tackled that gripe by offsetting it towards the inside. As you would expect at this price they are beautifully stitched together and, at just 85g, are super-light. The front sections are made from a slightly thicker Windstopper material, giving your toes a bit more of a barrier against the cold.

Although not rated waterproof, they will keep your feet dry in showers. They’re not particularly stretchy, so can be a bit fiddly to pull on over larger cleats such as Shimano’s SPD-SL type, but once in place, they’re a really snug fit and look the business, especially the high-viz yellow and black version.

Buy now

Endura Road II Overshoe: £26.59, Evans Cycles

Full disclosure – I’ve been wearing a pair of these for a couple of winters now and they’re still going strong. I can’t remember ever getting my feet wet while wearing them. They’ve got a really hard wearing Kevlar stitched section underneath in case you need to walk short distances in them, while there’s a Velcro and plastic strap at the top to keep the zip in place while riding.

Being neoprene, they’re nice and flexible so easy to pull on too. I’ve got the plain black, but if you want something a bit jazzier take at peek at the ones with silver and red detailing. At this price, they’re another bargain buy.

Buy now

Velotoze Short Overshoes: £14.99, Wiggle

This pair folds down into a carrying wallet small enough to stick in a pocket, pannier or a saddle bag so you can have them ready for when the weather takes an unexpected turn for the worst. They did a great job of keeping out the wind and rain but did get a bit sweaty inside on warmer rides. They’re made from a super-clingy latex compound and are actually a lot easier to put on than you would imagine at first glance.

Given they have no extra protection at the heel or toe they could wear through fairly quickly if you walk in them, so maybe hold on to them for emergencies when you want to protect your best shoes. Available in a great range of colours including red, green and pink.

Buy now

Dhb Extreme Weather Overshoes: £30, Wiggle​

If you’re not one to obsess over boutique-brand labels then this no-nonsense pair could be for you. Made from thicker 3.5mm neoprene, they should see you through the wettest and coldest days in comfort. There’s a Kevlar undersole plus protective areas at the heel and toe to limit wear when you’re walking. A quality waterproofed zip at the back is flanked by silver reflective stripes and there’s a Velcro strap at the ankle to stop them opening when you ride. We’ve tried out some great items from dhb over the years, and these are another quality bit of kit at a bargain price.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best men's cycling overshoes for autumn and winter

The fantastic Spatz are amazingly effective at keeping water out but are aimed at really hardcore riders and won’t suit those of us whose regular runs includes much walking – you’ll end up damaging the neoprene. If you need a tough pair of overshoes you can trot in and out of cafes or shops in, then take a look at our Best Buy – the super-tough Sportfuls – or the Enduras. If you find the whole overshoes thing a bit of a faff then try out the Lussos as they’re really easy to get on and off.

15 BEST ALTERNATIVE ADVENT CALENDARS FOR ADULTS

Christmas is nearly here, and December wouldn’t be the same without a countdown, advent calendar style. And while chocolate advent calendars are great, we’re more excited by the raft of quirky alternative calendars that have sprung onto the market in recent years.

From beauty and stationery to socks and even dog treats, there’s a calendar to suit everyone, whether you’re buying for yourself or for a friend or loved one.

We went on a search for the very best alternative advent calendars for adults, taking into account their appearance, price and contents.

We also found that buying an advent calendar was a great way to snap up a whole load of excellent products for a fraction of their usual price, so we also considered how much each calendar was worth, and how much you could get the products for in a very fun festive countdown.

The Body Shop 25 Days of the Enchanted Ultimate Advent Calendar: £99, The Body Shop

For a beauty and skincare calendar that’s as visually exciting as its contents, we highly recommend The Body Shop’s 25 Days of the Enchanted Ultimate Advent Calendar. The huge, festively-coloured box arrived stuffed with 25 surprises worth £231, including 14 full-sized products such as a giant almond milk and honey body lotion, a British rose hand cream and a Himalayan charcoal purifying glow mask.

There are some smaller Body Shop products too, perfect for taking in your hand luggage for a weekend break: shampoo, conditioner, make-up remover, moisturiser, body scrubs and more. In addition to the skincare, you’ll find some make-up treats in there too, such as mascara, eyeliner and lipgloss.

Plus, once we finished opening each box, the fun didn’t stop there: the empty boxes, once turned around, form a picture puzzle depicting a series of magical creatures, and on the side, each box has a small challenge to help you reconnect with nature.

A calendar that scores top marks both for its contents and its festively fun appearance.

10 BEST CHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR BEER LOVERS

Beer is an easy Christmas gift. So long as your recipient likes the stuff then a trip to the supermarket booze section will yield no end of giftable cans and bottles. But for maximum gratitude it’s worth putting a little more effort into your purchase. You could consider a big bottle of one of the limited edition releases available at this time of year, with Camden Town Brewery's Barrel-Aged Imperial Pilsner, Beer 2018, and Mikkeller’s Christmas Ale being among our favourites. Or you could consider one of the ten suggestions below, each one a guaranteed to bring a festive grin to whoever is on the receiving end.

Booths Ale Crate: £30, Booths

The beer buyers at Booths have got great taste so you can be sure that their gift packs are always stocked with quality beer. Six such bottles from the likes of Eden, Black Sheep and Saltaire come in this crate – a handy wooden caddy that has an even handier bottle opener fixed to one end making it the most portable and functional six pack we’ve seen.

Cannon & Cannon, Beer & Cured Meat Tin: £35, Cannon & Cannon

No one can survive Christmas on beer alone, so give your mate something to munch on with this tin of tasty treats. The British meat selection includes jerky with pineapple and chilli, spicy snacking salamis, a big posh salami (made with red wine and chocolate) and some superb biltong that will set you up for a prolonged chomp-a-thon. The two beers – FourPure’s Jukebox IPA and Northern Monk’s Mocha Porter – have been chosen to complement the meat and we particularly enjoyed the pairing of porter and salami, a combination that should keep you going through most of the Morecambe & Wise Christmas Special.

Buy now

Wild Beer Cap: £25, Wild Beer

Adorn the bonce of your beloved with one of these tip-top beery caps. There’s a variety of styles and colours to choose from, including a suave suede and twill five panel hat and a red, white and blue Trump-baiting truckers hat. We like the charcoal and twill snapback hat, featuring Wild Beer’s appropriately festive stag logo. One size fits all.

Buy now

Oak Bottle Opener: £15, The Wood Project

There’s nothing wrong with prizing off the top of a beer bottle with the toe end of a can opener, but there are better tools to make the operation that little bit more pleasurable. These hand carved oak openers are just the trick: well balanced, nicely claspable and the engraved wood not only looks good new but it will age as well as a bottle of Thomas Hardy’s Ale.

The Perfect Pint: A Beer Lover’s Handbook by Andy Hamilton: £12.99, Amazon

This book is not only a great gift for anyone interested in brewing their own beers, but there’s also enough to satisfy fans who have no interest in handling hops and malt. Author Andy Hamilton has travelled the land guzzling beer to provide education and witty anecdotes about the various beer styles available while recommending exemplary pints for each one. He’s also teased a few recipes from some of the brewers so you can recreate the goods at home.

Best of British, Craft Beer Box Set: £28.95, Best of British Beer

Lurking behind a fake box of ale-pun book spines your gleeful recipient will find six 330ml bottles from some of the UK’s top breweries to start their own beer library (our sample included Wiper & True, Cotswold Brew Co and Thornbridge). That box not only hides the beery evidence from nosey housemates but will almost certainly instigate a few festive attempts at book-and-beer punning.

The Lantern Tankard: £14.94 for a case of six, thelanterntankard.com

Modern Teku and Tulip glasses may be all the rage in trendy kitchens but, more often than not, we want to grip hold of a sturdy tankard when we’re dipping our beaks into a frothy brew. The Lantern Tankard is a ten-sided glass based on a design that used to be popular in the 1930s and is a reassuringly weighty vessel that adds an extra shimmer to a cold lager or pale ale. It’s also more likely to survive your clumsy attempts at wrapping than those dainty tekus.

Honest Brew, Secret Santa Howler: £9.90, Honest Brew

If you’ve been roped into the office’s annual Secret Santa gifting shambles then rather than try to find something funny and a little bit risqué, get something that almost anyone will enjoy: quality beer. Honest Brew’s three-can-howler is loaded with maximum craft beer flavour for under a tenner. The only downside is likely to be envy when you unwrap the disappointing gift you’ve been given. Still, giving is better than receiving…

Brew like Beavertown and mash like Marstons with this monster stainless steel pantheon of malt, hops and grain. It’s an all-in-one beer brewing system, meaning you can mash, sparge, boil and cool your brews into whatever style you fancy with maximum control and the minimum of fuss. The built-in Bluetooth connectivity enables you to keep track of your beer’s progress and tinker with the settings via an app on a smart device of choice.

It will also connect you to the wider Grainfather brewing community to share recipes and beery tips. Its 30 litre capacity (which will produce up to 20 litres of beer) has a relatively small footprint so won’t dominate your kitchen or brewing shed too much. It’s not cheap – but this is the closest you’ll get to brewing nirvana without owning an actual brewery.

9 BEST VEGAN CHEESES

Being a vegan might mean going dairy-free, but it doesn’t mean you have to miss out on cheese. Whether you're looking for options made from soya, nut or coconut, there are more options than ever before, with some created for Christmas. Here’s our round-up of the best

Caramel Pecan Vegan Creamed Chease: £7.95, Tyne Chease at Yumbles​

While hard vegan cheeses have been on the market for years, a truly indulgent cream cheese has been tougher for crafters to handle. However, this glass jar of Caramel Pecan Creamed ‘Chease’ – the first of two entries by family-run artisan company Tyne Chease – comes close to perfection. Organic cashew nuts provide the tangy creamy base whilst the mix of crunchy pecans and syrup-like dates provide complimentary levels of sweetness.

At £7.95, it’s a little on the pricey side, but that’s expected for a focus on organic and natural ingredients, including probiotics and Himalayan salt). What’s more, a four-week shelf life means you can tuck into it well into the new year. Overall, it’s the perfect complement to your cheeseboard this festive season.

After Dinner Blueberry Wedge: £2.89, Violife

Violife is pretty much the king of vegan cheese: it’s been around long before veganism became popular and is known for its wide variety of nut-free, soy-free and dairy-free cheese (coconut oil is the main ingredient).

This after-dinner blueberry wedge is great value for money. It’s packed with blueberries – it also comes in a more traditionally festive cranberry variety should you prefer it – and contains added vitamin B12, a much-needed nutrient for many vegans.

It tastes a little dry when sliced, but it comes into its own melted.

The Vegan Cheese Collection Taster Box: £23.40, The Naturally Vegan Food Company at Yumbles

Why have one cheese when you can have four? Northampton-based The Naturally Vegan Food Company has come up with a perfect taster box for your Christmas party. A collection of two generously sized ‘cheeze balls’ (a smokey paprika infused version and an original – both of which taste convincingly like Cheddar), a creamy cashew spread and an Italian cooking cheese (an excellent replacement for Parmesan, which tastes fantastic sprinkled on pretty much anything).

The collection is made using organic almonds and cashews; as well as vegan staples such as tofu, cider vinegar and nutritional yeast. Its focus on organic and natural ingredients makes this the perfect choice for health-conscious, vegan foodies this Christmas,

Buy now

Nush Almond Milk Cream Cheese Style Spread Chive: £2.75, Ocado

Nush is a relatively new brand of nut-based yoghurts – and its recently added two flavours of cream cheese. Stocked in most major supermarkets, Nush’s cheese offering is both affordable (one of the cheapest options in our roundup) and healthy. With 93 per cent almonds, the spread also contains live vegan cultures, something that many vegans miss out on when ditching dairy products).

It also tastes great. It’s surprisingly creamy and one of the easiest of our cheeses to spread, making it perfect for your Christmas-morning bagels.

Buy now

Vegan Cheese Selection Box: £17.09, Tyne and Chease at Yumbles

Looking to put on a proper spread? This vegan cheese selection box is for you. It contains 10 mini-cheeses with unusual flavours such as za’atar spice, Ethiopian spice and sundried tomato.

Tyne and Chease delivers on taste. With all these cheeses being made by hand, they taste just as rich and smooth as their dairy-containing equivalents, avoiding the slightly synthetic aftertaste of some cheaper brands.

Add the crackers and throw a party.

Buy now

Violife Cheeseboard: £5, Asda

With vegan products previously being restricted to health food shops and online, it’s great to see mainstream supermarkets now offering value options, too. And what could be more purse-friendly than a cheeseboard for a fiver?

This cheeseboard combines three of Violife’s most popular flavours in 150g portions: the surprisingly meltable mature block (a great all-rounder whatever the time of year and a perfect base for cauliflower cheese); the zesty cranberry wedge and a rich blu wedge. The perfect starter kit for a great vegan Christmas and one of the few cheese brands that are also nut-free.

Buy now

Cranberry Wensleydale Alternative: £1.75, Asda

Asda delivers again with its own brand of cheese. This Wensleydale Cranberry Cheese alternative is new this winter, along with a range of other flavours (Cheddar, and garlic and chive).

At £2 for a substantial 200g block, it’s the cheapest item in our roundup: yet despite it being a budget buy, it more than delivered on flavour. Upon opening the packet, we were taken in by an authentic, Wensleydale-esque aroma and were impressed by how smoothly it crumbled.

Low-cost doesn’t mean low on cranberries either: it combined a generous helping of large cranberry chunks with a smooth, mild Cheddar taste.

The downside is it does rely on some thickeners and regulators not found in some of the handmade choices on our roundup.

But overall, this product delivers on both the price test and taste test.

Buy now

Vegan Cheese Kit: £32.99, Mad Millie

If the above options haven’t whetted your appetite, then why not make your own? Mad Millie’s Vegan Cheese Kit contains instructions, recipes and equipment to create your individual take on vegan halloumi, cream cheese, feta ricotta, mozzarella and mascarpone.

While it seems daunting at first, you only need a handful of ingredients (usually your choice of nuts, salt, spices and dairy-free milk) and recipes are labelled by their difficulty level.

It’s the most expensive option on our list, but if you like to know exactly what goes into your food, struggle with multiple intolerances or want to take your Christmas hostess skills to the next level, then the Vegan Cheese Kit could be for you.

Buy now

White Cheddar and Cranberry: £6, Kinda Co.

Vegan founder Ellie set out to find the perfect plant-based cheese several years ago, after struggling to satisfy her cheese cravings. The result is Kinda Co: which sells a range of inventive, nut-based cheeses both online and at vegan festivals across the country.

Not only do they focus on healthy ingredients (such as miso, natural cultures and apple cider vinegar), but all items use glass jars and biodegradable wax paper in a bid to cut down on plastic. The white Cheddar and cranberry slice is a new take on a Christmas classic.

White miso gives the cheese an addictive tang, which is perfectly suited to the dried strawberries, while the mixture of cashew nuts and coconut oil creates a creamy base.

If you're planning on making an order, look out for the Faux Lox+Dill Cream cheese variety (£7), which uses fermented carrots as a convincing substitute for smoked salmon.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best vegan cheeses

Tyne and Chease’s indulgent Caramel Pecan Creamed Cheese gets our vote for an indulgent festive purchase.

If you’re looking for something more budget-friendly, we love Asda’s Cranberry Wensleydale alternative.

Finally, if you’re vegan and health-conscious, then the Naturally Vegan Food Company’s taster box is perfect for a Christmas spread.

6 BEST CHRISTMAS SANDWICHES FOR VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS

Few British traditions carry the cult status of the high street Christmas sandwich.

Historically, such delicacies have been reserved for carnivores, laden with meaty stuffing and turkey-based fillings, but now, vegetarians and vegans are finally getting a look in.

The majority of high street chains release a number of options for the festive season that appeal to a wide range of diets, so, in the name of pioneering journalism, we decided to pick the best of the bunch.

From studying flavours like judges on MasterChef to analysing the air pockets in between lettuce curves like food historians, the humble sarnie lends itself to deep and meaningful analysis – we took our responsibilities very seriously indeed.

So, because there’s nothing worse than taking a bite out of a sandwich and realising you’ve made the wrong decision, here’s our roundup of the very best vegan and vegetarian options to satiate all your meat-free festive needs.

Pret a Manger Very Merry Christmas Lunch Sandwich: £3.75, Pret A Manger

This is quite a squishy sandwich.

Grilled carrots, crispy onions and baby spinach make for nice embellishments to Pret’s festive vegan stuffing, which it topped of with a rather fancy port and orange cranberry sauce.

The sauce may seem a little intense at a first, but you soon adapt and come to realise that Pret a Manger really does know a thing or two about the art of sandwich-making.

It contains a solid, hearty amount of filling and will keep you satisfied till dinner time.

The sandwich also has a charitable backstory, which will see 50p for every one sold donated to the Pret Foundation Trust, which aims to break the cycle of homelessness.

Buy now

EAT Brie, Cranberry & Stuffing on Onion Seed Sandwich: £3.99, EAT

Creamy brie and crunchy nut stuffing make for a delightful clash of textures.

It has the perfect amount of zingy cranberry sauce: not too much that it’s overpowering, but not too little that you question its presence.

Though, with so much cheese and so few vegetables, this hearty sandwich is a bit on the heavier side and is probably best enjoyed by those with rumbling bellies.

Available in stores from 7 November

Tesco Wicked Kitchen Smoked Carrot Celebration Sandwich: £3, Tesco

You might be more accustomed to roasted carrots than smoked ones, but they work a treat in this innovative plant-based sandwich, which also features soya-based cream cheese, gherkins and red onions, all layered in between two thick slices of rye bread.

It’s a very light option, though maybe not the most festive in the Christmas sarnie roster, given that the only yuletide-like ingredient is, well, smoked carrot.

That being said, there is a light spreading of cranberry chutney too, which gave the sandwich a pleasing tangy taste. But there’s not quite enough in there, meaning you may find yourself struggling to keep your filling in between the bread and not on the floor.

Buy now

PAUL ‘Tis The Vegan: £4.35, PAUL

You wouldn’t think a French bakery would do the vegan thing, when traditional French cooking is predominantly based on meat and dairy products.

But PAUL has surprised us all with its new plant-based Christmas baguette, which contains a delicious combination of hummus, grilled carrots, peppers, spinach and cranberry sauce.

Again, there’s not much that screams “Christmas” here, aside from the cranberry sauce, but it’s a tasty offering nonetheless.

Plus, it contains hummus, which is at the upper echelons of vegan foods thanks to its unbridled versatility.

Buy now

Marks & Spencer No Turkey Feast Sandwich: £3.30, Marks & Spencer

Now, this is something different.

Unlike its counterparts, this sandwich actually uses a meat replacement, containing roasted soya protein, which is confusing because it feels and tastes a bit like chicken.

That being said, the malted bread is pillow-soft and does a very good job at keeping the additional fillings – cranberry chutney and spinach – in place.

Plus, the supermarket is donating five per cent of profits from sales to the homeless charity, Shelter – this is not just a sandwich, this is a philanthropic sandwich.

Buy now

Starbucks Brie & Cranberry Focaccia: £4.25, Starbucks

Well, this went down an absolute treat among vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.

With all the trimmings you could think of – Cheddar and mustard sauce, balsamic roasted red onions and fresh spinach – it’s so much more than an average sarnie.

You’ve also got the rosemary-infused focaccia, which conjures up memories of traditional Christmas Day lunches, making you think it’s as close as you can get to eating roast potatoes without actually eating potatoes.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best Christmas sandwiches for vegetarians and vegans

Overall, you can't compete with a Pret a Manger sandwich. It would satisfy even the most vegan-averse of meat-eaters thanks to its rich texture and festive flavours. It has all the jingle bells and whistles.

9 BEST SKI BASE LAYERS FOR WOMEN

Thermals, long johns, base layers – whatever you want to call them, there’s nothing like a snuggly warm layer next to the skin to help keep the chill of winter at bay. It may sound like something your granny would advise but it really is worth investing in a great set of thermals for cold weather, and they’re especially useful for skiers and snowboarders. Wear below salopettes and a ski jacket for warmth on the ski lifts and breathability when you’re tearing down the pistes.

We’d recommend picking a set of base layers with full-length leggings and long sleeves. It’s definitely worth trying thermals on in person, especially if you’re on the tall or short side – they should hug your body without feeling tight and you shouldn’t feel any restriction around the waistband, ankles, neck or sleeves.

You may find that differently sized or even different branded tops and bottoms fit you best. Some base layers are stretchier than others – we reckoned the former offered more warmth on test as there’s no empty space between fabric and your skin for the pesky cold wind to creep in. Most base layers are synthetic but some are made with either a blend or 100 per cent pure merino wool, a wise (if pricier) choice as merino is very warm but great at wicking away sweat and has naturally antibacterial properties, too. If you’re planning a week of backcountry ski touring far from the nearest shower then merino layers are ideal.

Odlo Blackcomb SUW top: £60, Odlo

Quite simply, one of the best base layers we’ve ever tested. Odlo’s Blackcomb collection is all the things we look for in cold weather clothing – warm and comfortable to wear all day, it wicks away sweat fast and keeps its shape and stretchiness wash after wash. The SUW top looks smart. It’s also available with a built-in facemask, ideal for winter sports.

Buy now

TOG24 Fixby top and bottoms: £20 each, TOG24

Our top pick on a budget are these simple, flattering base layers – at £40 for the set they’re a steal, and are ideal if you’re off on your first ski holiday or need a spare set of inner layers. They were some of the softest and silkiest base layers we tested, and we like the high zipped neck of the top, the comfortable waist band of the bottoms and the fact that they incorporate carbon fibres to help keep them smelling fresh.

Buy the top and bottoms now

Columbia Titanium Omni Heat top: £70, Columbia

This flattering top may look like a standard base layer on the outside, but inside it all goes a bit space-age, featuring a tight pattern of Columbia’s Omni Heat silver dots to reflect heat back to your body. It feels comfortable, if a little plastic-y, on the skin, and the technology does work very effectively to keep warmth trapped inside. A good choice if you tend to feel the cold.

Buy now

Van Loon Maxim top: £190, Van Loon

Like to go luxe with your sportswear? This very good-looking base layer is definitely on the pricey side, but it does combine style and substance brilliantly. It’s made from sumptuous Gojira Merino wool, which is soft, wicking and warm, and we love the high neck and retro styling. The base layer a Bond girl would probably plump for – one to wear to apres.

Buy now

Montane Primino 140 T-shirt: £50, Montane

Montane’s Primino range comes in two weights, 220g and 140g, so you can mix and match according to the weather. We rate their whole collection of tops, bottoms, face masks and gloves, but this short-sleeved teal t-shirt is especially good for warm-weather spring skiing, with merino wool for warmth and odour resistance. It’s just as useful for hiking and running, making it a good investment both on and off the pistes.

Buy now

Protest Many top: £39.99, Protest

What a good-looker – this is a base layer handsome enough to wear anywhere. The light and silky fabric is comfortable and cool when you’re skiing hard, with a cosy high turtle neck, but the lighter weight is perhaps best for warmer spring skiing. It’s slim-fitting, so we recommend going a size up if you’re planning on eating lots of fondue on the mountains.

Buy now

Dare2B Solaris top: £29.95, Dare2B

A very versatile choice and for a decent price, Dare2B’s Solaris makes a great addition to your snow wardrobe. It’s light enough to wear alone as a base layer, but the zipped front and fuzzy brushed fabric make it work well as a mid layer on colder days, too. It features a warm high neck and handy pockets. We did dislike the large metal logo stuck on one arm.

Buy now

Mountain Warehouse Talus bottoms: £9.99, Mountain Warehouse

Incredible value for money from Mountain Warehouse here. The warm, wicking Talus pant is one of the best bottoms we tried out, and is comfy and warm and with good stretch. The knees did start to sag a little after a few washes, but for less than £10 the Talus is totally worth having in your kit cupboard, or taking as a spare pair of bottoms on a ski trip.

Buy now

Icebreaker Oasis top and bottoms: £75 and £65, Icebreaker

Icebreaker base layers are a cult favourite in the winter sports world, and we can see why. They may sit at the pricy end of the market, but if you take skiing seriously you’ll get your money’s worth out of them – 100% merino wool means they are seriously warm without feeling heavy, and were some of the most breathable and odour-free base layers we tried out. You’ll barely feel them on when you’re skiing up a storm.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best ski base layers for women

There are plenty of great options for all budgets here, but we especially rate Odlo and Icebreaker for great performance. On a budget? Mountain Warehouse’s Talus pants are an absolute steal.

10 BEST WOMEN'S WINTER COATS

Every autumn thousands of new winter must-haves flood the high street, but the reality is that we expect our coats to last a few years, rather than a few months. If we’re going to invest a couple of hundred pounds on a garment, we want it to work hard: it needs to be versatile, the cut must be timeless, and of course it has to be warm.

While mass brands benefit from economies of scale, you really do get what you pay for with coats. A quality wool blend will contain 20-25% polyamide (aka Nylon) – this makes a coat more durable and resistant to moisture – though modern textile technology means entirely synthetic options can feel just as luxurious.

We scoured the high street for our favourites, trying each coat on three different women aged between 28 and 65, all with different body shapes.

Funnel-neck coat: £129, Zara

Zara, how do you do it? We all adored this £129 funnel-neck coat. Often belted coats can look like dressing gowns, but this is structured enough to avoid that faux pas.

The wool blend is warm enough for a British winter, while the double-breasted buttons and flap pockets deliver instant polish. We loved the dramatic length but more petite wearers may need it taken up an inch or two.

Buy now

Leopard print tailored coat: £325, Karen Millen

Karen Millen is the dark horse of the high street. Its tailoring and fabrics are of a high standard making it a goldmine for sleek, office-appropriate pieces. This double-breasted coat in a muted leopard jacquard is one such piece. It’s a nod to the animal print trend without being too showy. It’s not the warmest, but great for layering.

It fell exactly at the knee on our testers (5ft 4in and 5ft 6in) but looks good just above the knee in the model image online, too.

Buy now

Single-breasted coat: £89, Marks & Spencer

The M&S coat of the season, we’re told, and we can believe it. Its cocoon shape and above-the-knee length make it easy to wear, it comes in a broad range of sizes and it costs less than £100. What’s not to like? The slightly fuzzy polyester-wool blend is pretty cosy, too.

It’s only available online in navy, but we spotted it in-store in a mustardy yellow and (our favourite) violet.

Buy now

Coat with oversized lapels: £190, Cos

Our testers were a little daunted by the bold colour of this coat, but a vibrant fuchsia will serve you better than you think. It looked great over our black, taupe and denim clothing, the boyish shape was flattering, plus it looked and felt far more expensive than its price tag.

Buy now

Topitown coat: £285, American Vintage

This cult French brand specialises in luxury basics – and not our first port of call for coats, but this cream number caught our eye in a shop window. We’re so glad we tried it. The fit is oversized for a slouchy, nonchalant look (it was comfortable over a leather jacket) with roomy front pockets.

The textured cream fabric includes wool, alpaca and mohair, giving it a fuzzy texture and plenty of warmth. Plus, the price was surprisingly reasonable for a contemporary designer brand.

Buy now

Felix double-breasted khaki peacoat: £295, Reiss

Not everyone loves long coats, and this sharp khaki style from Reiss is perfect for more petite frames. We liked how the pockets were positioned slightly higher than usual and the military vibe makes it smarter than most shorter coats. The quality is great, but it’s at the more expensive end of the spectrum.

Buy now

Double-layer hooded coat: £69.90, Uniqlo

This hooded coat is made of a wool-polyester-Nylon blend making it ideal for rainy days. The double-layer – navy on the outside, grey on the inside – felt toasty warm and the shape is sleek and understated. It has pockets in the seam and closes with a single button. The length was above the knee on all our testers.

Buy now

Harris Wharf London oversized wool coat: £345, Net-a-porter.com

Harris Wharf London is a family-run label that has become known for its unlined, 100% wool coats with open seams. In theory this could look scruffy, but in real life the finish looks crisp and smart.

Given the designer-quality fabric and cut, prices are reasonable – this oversized style is £345 and we love the cheery orange hue. The lack of lining makes it lightweight, though it would need a heavy knit beneath for really cold days.

Buy now

Shawl collar faux fur coat: £225, Jigsaw

Leather and fur substitutes keep getting better, and this suede-look polyester number with faux fur collar and cuffs is a perfect example. It suited all three testers – though it looks better open than buttoned – is roomy enough for some layers, has pockets in the side seams and was ultra-cosy to wear.

Buy now

Checked recycled wool coat: £139.99, Mango

Checked coats are making a comeback and Mango does one of the best. This double-breasted style is made from recycled wool and the brown-cream palette gives it a vintage aesthetic. We loved the unstructured shape and length. It has outer pockets and felt comfortable over a bulky knit.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best women's winter coats

The Zara coat won top marks for style, warmth, quality and price, making it very hard to beat.

10 BEST CHRISTMAS PUDDING ALTERNATIVES – CAKES AND DESSERTS

You can never have too many dessert options over Christmas. Sometimes you might want an alternative to Christmas pudding.

We’ve compiled this round-up of the best Christmas desserts for 2018, sure to reawaken your guests appetite, even after the heaviest of festive feasts. We have cakes, logs and even a vegan/gluten-free option.

Of course, you could make your own dessert, but why bother when they look this good?

Whether you’re looking for something traditional, nice and light or suitable for vegans, there’s something here to impress everyone.

Marks & Spencer The Collection Belgian Chocolate & Cherry Dessert 1kg (serves 10): £20, Marks & Spencer

We’re always blown away by the festive selection at M&S and this year is no exception. It was hard to choose just one pudding to include in this roundup, but in the end this chocolate and cherry creation just pipped the others to the post.

Crafted from smooth Belgian chocolate mousse, the rectangular shape made it nice and easy to cut and serve slices, and when you do, the pretty layered insides are revealed.

Light but still decadent, you won’t find this too heavy after your Christmas main.

Buy now

Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Melting Belgian Chocolate Billionaires Dome 1.05kg (serves 10): £12, Sainsbury’s

If you want to serve your guests a restaurant-worthy dessert this Christmas, this show-stopper from Sainsbury’s festive range should do the trick.

The huge gold-flecked chocolate dome hides layers of chocolate fudge brownie, Belgian chocolate mousse and a chocolate biscuit base. Did we mention this was quite, chocolate-y?

To create the magic, simply microwave the sea salted caramel pot included, pour the piping hot liquid over the dome and watch it melt away.

Buy now

Cartwright and Butler Iced Christmas Cake in a Tin 700g (serves 8): £15, Cartwright and Butler

Founded in Yorkshire in 1981, Cartwright & Butler have garnered a legion of fans over the years for their traditional recipes, and this Christmas cake is hands down the best we’ve tried.

Presented in a beautiful blue reuseable tin (great for gifting if you can bear to part with it!), the moist cake is dense with sticky cherries, sultanas and almonds, all soaked in brandy. It has been covered in a delicious layer of marzipan that’s not too sweet and is finished with a very tasteful black and white wreath design.

There’s really no better afternoon treat to accompany your cup of tea this December.

Buy now

Asda Extra Special Raspberry and Pistachio Wreath 397g (serves 8): £6, Asda

Delivering a pop of colour to festive feasting, this frozen meringue wreath is perfectly crisp on the outside with a soft and chewy centre.

Layered with piped cream, dotted with raspberries, and sprinkled with pistachios, it’s then finished with a drizzle of chocolate sauce for good measure. Yet because of the meringue base, we still found it was light enough to enjoy after a heavy meal.

Buy now

Picard Dragees Cherry Frozen Log 500g (serves 8): £16.99, Ocado

It’s always handy to keep a frozen dessert on standby during the festive season, and this candy cane shaped treat only needs to be taken out of the freezer a couple of minutes before serving – making dessert one less thing to think about on Christmas Day.

Inside you’ll find delicious creamy hazelnut ice-cream coupled with cherry sauce, cherry sorbet and a rather grown up green tea and bergamot biscuit base.

Buy now

Tesco Finest Chocolate & Ginger Cake 980g (serves 18): £12, Tesco

Super sweet and very rich, a little slice of this centrepiece should suffice, although we’re not sure we’d be able to make it stretch to the 18 servings Tesco suggest.

The chocolate sponge has flecks of candied ginger throughout as well as a layer of orange curd although the overall taste wasn’t particularly overpowering.

It’s wrapped in an edible chocolate ribbon, decorated with gold Christmas trees and stars and topped with chocolate swirls and gold baubles.

Buy now

Heston from Waitrose Hot Toddy Bombe 227g (serves 2): £4, Waitrose

We always look forward to Heston’s creative twists on the Christmas classics and here he’s made an old favourite, exceptionally boozy.

The sponge has been laced with candied ginger and a healthy dose of warming cinnamon, but cut inside and you’ll find a rich sauce based on a hot toddy.

The combination of sherry, whisky and rum really packs a punch and is sure to warm your cockles this winter.

Buy now

Aldi’s Specially Selected Exquisite Chocolate Carousel 800g: £14.99, Aldi

Christmas is a time for pulling out all the stops and we think Aldi has stepped up to the game. Sure this is handcrafted and made entirely of Fairtrade Belgian milk chocolate, but it’s way more impressive than chucking a box of chocolates on the table at the end of your meal.

This centrepiece comes complete with four chocolate horse lollipops (the sticks are the only inedible bit – which stops things from getting too messy if you have little ones), leaving you to fight over the rest yourself.

In store from December 14

Morrisons The Best Mini Christmas Trees 360g (serves six): £9, Morrisons

Super impressive with their bronze piped design and multi-coloured layers of filling, this pack of six is new to Morrisons this year.

The combination of cocoa sponge, velvety smooth orange-flavoured mousse and rich dark chocolate mousse is both moreish and decadent yet light enough to manage after a festive feast. The slightly bitter layer of solid Belgian dark chocolate makes this suitably grown up.

In store from December 19

The Verdict: Best Christmas cakes

We’ve awarded our Indy Best Buy to M&S because we couldn’t resist a slice of its grown-up dessert, even after a heavy festive feast.

However, we were also big fans of Sainsbury’s flamboyant chocolate extravaganza. If you can’t have a bit of magic at Christmas, then when can you?

Dear Santa I’d Like A Unicorn Kid’s Christmas Sweatshirt: £22.10, Batch1

We couldn’t resist popping this in the line-up because it’s a sassy alternative to the overly cutesy Christmas jumpers that seem to be aimed at girls. And it’s perfect for little ladies who already have everything… except a unicorn.

Eloise Jumper Dress: £24, Frugi

Some little ones feel a bit silly going all-out on the Christmas jumper thing. One of our testers would much rather fade into the background than go to school dressed like an extra from Dude, Where’s My Donkey? on Christmas Jumper Day. She loved this snuggly Eloise Jumper Dress as an alternative. Featuring a snowball print and a cute Frugi character applique on the front, it’s wintry enough to pass as a Christmas jumper yet practical enough to wear well beyond December.

Kid’s Christmas Novelty Jumper: £10, Nutmeg at Morrison’s

Our favourite thing about this festive woolly is the fact that it comes in both kid’s and adult’s sizes, so you can kit out the whole clan in matching Christmas jumpers. We were surprised by just how much our five year old tester loved wearing the same jumper as her mum. Her mum, on the other hand, is a tiny bit less enthusiastic about going grocery shopping in a penguin sweater that matches her pre-schooler’s.

Christmas Winter Winner Suit: £44.95, Opposuits

Yikes, Christmas jumpers suddenly seem so last year. We laughed out loud when a box of outlandish Christmas suits arrived on our desk for this piece, but every member of our testing family could eventually be found admiring themselves in one of these snazzy Christmas suits.
