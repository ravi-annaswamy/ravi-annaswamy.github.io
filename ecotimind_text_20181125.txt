GOVERNMENT VS. RBI: SO, YOU THINK IT WAS A DRAW? THINK AGAIN.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley and RBI governor Urjit Patel after an RBI central board meeting on February 10, 2018, in New Delhi.

Who moved my interest rates?When former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Duvvuri Subbarao penned a hard-hitting book after five turbulent years (2008-13) as governor, the frostiness in ties between the central bank and the government became common knowledge.But that wasn’t a one-off. The Jawaharlal Nehru era, for instance, is remembered for the bitter rivalry between Nehru’ future, the board for financial supervision, which looks into the feasibility of PCA relaxation, would most likely recommend a status quo. Also, whatever changes the government has insisted upon have little impact at a systemic level. In round 1, the RBI, it appears, has beaten the government at its own game.Over to the next board meeting. (Graphics by Sadhana Saxena)

TOP MUTUAL FUND SCHEMES TO INVEST IN FY 2018-19 ON ECONOMIC TIMES

Equity mutual funds are the best investment option to achieve your long-term financial goals. Countless studies have proven that stocks have the potential to offer superior returns than other asset classes over a long period. So, if you have a long-term financial goal that is at least five to seven years away, you should consider investing in equity mutual fund schemes.However, it is equally important to choose the right equity mutual fund scheme. Your choice of mutual fund scheme should match your goals, investment horizon and risk profile. For example, if you are a conservative equity investor investing for a five-year goal, you may consider investing in largecap mutual fund schemes.If the investor wants to create the corpus without much volatility, he may also consider investing in aggressive hybrid schemes. Aggressive hybrid schemes invest in a mixed portfolio of equity (65-80 per cent) and debt (20-35 per cent). The debt part of the scheme offers stability to the portfolio during volatile times.Investors with moderate risk profile can consider investing in multicap schemes that invest across market capitalisations. These schemes are riskier than largecap schemes but have the potential to offer superior returns.Aggressive investors with a high risk tolerance and longer investment horizon can consider investing in midcap and smallcap schemes . These schemes invest in mid-sized and small-sized companies and can turn highly volatile during a bad phase in the market. However, these companies can grow into large companies and reward investors with extra returns for the extra risk they are taking.Sector schemes or thematic schemes are meant for sophisticated or high networth investors. These schemes can help investors to take exposure to a sector or theme that they want to bet. However, mutual fund advisors believe that investors should invest in these schemes only if they can time their entry and exit in these schemes and have intimate knowledge about the sector.High net worth investors can also look at international schemes to diversify their portfolio across geographies. However, mutual fund advisors believe that small investors should give these schemes a miss as it would dilute total returns from their portfolio.

Who moved my interest rates?When former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Duvvuri Subbarao penned a hard-hitting book after five turbulent years (2008-13) as governor, the frostiness in ties between the central bank and the government became common knowledge.But that wasn’t a one-off. The Jawaharlal Nehru era, for instance, is remembered for the bitter rivalry between Nehru’ future, the board for financial supervision, which looks into the feasibility of PCA relaxation, would most likely recommend a status quo. Also, whatever changes the government has insisted upon have little impact at a systemic level. In round 1, the RBI, it appears, has beaten the government at its own game.Over to the next board meeting. (Graphics by Sadhana Saxena)

TRAI TAKES A SHOT AT REGULATING OTT SERVICES. BUT IT MAY HAVE WOKEN UP A BIT TOO LATE.

TRAI has sought stakeholders’ views on which services can be categorised as “same” or “similar” to those provided by telcos. That will be key to deciding how OTT players can be regulated and made to pay up.

Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla with TRAI chief RS Sharma during the International Mobile Congress on October 25, 2018, in New Delhi.

Here’s a conversation from a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip: Calvin’s mom: Why should I drive you Calvin, it’s a perfect day outside! What do you think people have feet for?Calvin: To work the gas pedal!!!!Replace Calvin’s mom with India’s telecom companies and Calvin with the over-the-top (OTT) players, and you have a industry experts, the regulator should have been a little more proactive in intervening and setting the rules. Nonetheless, it will be interesting to watch how the industry stakeholders respond to this consultation paper and what kind of regulatory changes come out of it. Till then, OTTs can continue to enjoy the free joyride on telcos’ networks.(Graphic by Abdul Shafiq)

MODERN INVESTORS SHOULD HAVE A STAN LEE PORTFOLIO. ANCHOR IT WITH SPIDER-MAN AND SUPERCHARGE IT WITH IRON MAN.

Stan Lee, co-creator of Spider-Man

Peter Parker’s parents died in a plane crash, and he was raised by Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City. Last week, he was orphaned one more time. Stan Lee, his co-creator, died at the age of 95. Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man, who appeared for the first time in Amazing Fantasy published in 1962. Since then, Spider-Man but it would never be his top holding.Make Coca-Cola (or Unilever) your anchor: Lee’s greatest co-creating act was Spider-Man. No matter what he did, he would not have been able to outdo Peter Parker. Even after 60 years of existence, Peter Parker still rings a bell with all teenagers across the world. Just like Coke.

A rate hike by the RBI could have brought cheer to the markets and arrested the rupee’s free fall. But it would have set a dangerous precedent. For the moment, India should seek inspiration from Turkey, which let go of its currency to reap bumper economic returns.

Sterlite Copper’s economic and environmental impact on Tamil Nadu in general and Thoothukudi in particular has created a divide within the people, some who benefited and others who feel they were betrayed.

The IPOs that hit the market between April and October cashed in just in time. For the rest, the offers are deals stuck in time. The way the market has turned, it’s going to be a long wait.

An investor fills up an IPO form in Mumbai; Arko Datta/Reuters

The year 2018 should have been a bumper one for IPOs. Should have. Could have. Won't.According to Prime Database, a research firm, 54 IPOs approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) are stuck in the pipeline. Together they would have raised INR64,000 crore. Apart from this, there are 25 IPOs waiting for Sebi’s approval to mobilise INR22,000 crore. a higher variety and mix in the IPOs that hit the market. I wouldn’t be too pessimistic about the outlook.”Investing often seems like a game of poker, with luck and skill playing as equal partners. What remains to be seen in this particular game is whether lead managers and funds are still feeling lucky.(Graphics by Ankita Mehrotra)

ICAI IS DEAD. HOW A MINISTRY REPORT PUT THE FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN.

The chartered accountants’ institute is all set to cede its ground to the National Financial Reporting Authority on regulatory matters of the audit profession. It may also have to give up other administrative powers and get reduced to just a coaching institute.

"... CA is an arrangement in which the human resource development is done only by you. Curriculum is made by you only; you conduct the exam; rules and regulations are also made by you, and your institute only punishes the culprits."Now the question arises that the temple of democracy i.e. the Parliament of India, which is the voice of 125 names of CAs from the register maintained by ICAI — will lead to a situation where the auditors would not be able to perform/discharge their function, duties, and responsibilities fairly and independently. The court issued a notice to the government, returnable in four weeks. The case will come up for hearing on January 16.Hope lives on. (Graphic by Sadhana Saxena)

Like filter coffee.“We are excited about our coffee decoction. It has longer shelf life, and is hence easier to distribute and retail,” says the co-founder and CEO inside us, we want to reach somewhere, faster, and easier,” Musthafa told the students at Harvard. “My sincere request to you is, avoid shortcuts.”Leave that job to iD’s quick-and-easy batter packs.(Clarification: An earlier version of the story had misspelt PC Musthafa's name. Also, iD Fresh produces 55 tonnes of batter everyday and not 55,000 tonnes. We regret the errors.)

THE INR49,991 CRORE SECRET: HOW KHADI MADE THE GOVERNMENT INDIA’S LARGEST CONSUMER-GOODS MAKER

Support entrepreneurs and incentivise them to create jobs. Evict squatters feeding off your brand. Widen product range and distribution with clinical focus. Not attributes you associate with a government enterprise, but Brand Khadi has done it all.

Khadi India Store at Connaught Place, New Delhi; photo by Muhabit ul haq

Khadi — Gandhi’s beloved, the mother of swadeshi icons, the flagship of sleepy, musty Khadi Gramodyog Bhavans. Add to that one more distinction — the biggest-selling FMCG product group in India. By a country mile.No, really. With jaw-dropping annual sales, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), a body run by the Ministry of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises, is Finance. There, managing director William Bissell convinced artisans to individually contribute to the fund that helped fuel the community-owned firms that produce for Fabindia. KVIC’s model is the same, but crucially, it has access to government funds.Of course, it doesn’t hurt to have the country’s most powerful man as your chief evangelist.(Graphics by Ankita Mehrotra)

Shruti Bhat could be the most powerful woman you’ve never heard of. Bhat, aka Artsy Craftsy Mom, is part of a guerrilla online force influencing what you feed your child. With over 65,000 followers on Facebook, Bhat’s blog posts on her family’s “PediaSure journey” are lapped up by hundreds of thousands, mostly mothers. Her expertise includes writing on wholesome food like chapati or eggs. I am not in favour of any tinned-food concept. Building infection resistance in the 2-6 years age group can be done in several ways. I don’t think feeding hungry children with this kind of products is a good idea.”Bhat’s fans might tell you a different story, though.(Graphics by Sadhana Saxena)

Also, there has been a rising clamour among doctors about the nutritional benefits of malt-based drinks.

VAHDAM AND TEABOX ARE BREWING AN UNLIKELY ‘MAKE IN INDIA’ TUSSLE

Kausshal Dugarr, founder, Teabox; courtesy of Teabox

What does it take to sell good old loose-leaf tea from the plantations of Darjeeling to a chai connoisseur in, say, New York? Quite a lot. Which is why two startups, one from Delhi and another from Siliguri, West Bengal, have raised big money on the promise of taking fresh ‘orthodox’ tea to consumers abroad. Vahdam Teas, founded in 2015, has marketing, there is an opportunity to do that in tea and other high-end goods.

What does it take to sell good old loose-leaf tea from the plantations of Darjeeling to a chai connoisseur in, say, New York? Quite a lot. Which is why two startups, one from Delhi and another from Siliguri, West Bengal, have raised big money on the promise of taking fresh ‘orthodox’ tea to consumers abroad. Vahdam Teas, founded in 2015, has marketing, there is an opportunity to do that in tea and other high-end goods.

CHICKEN RUN: KFC’S JOURNEY FROM STRUGGLE TO BOUNCE-BACK, ONE LEG PIECE AT A TIME

Back in 2014, KFC India was beginning to resemble something close to its business: a headless chicken. In sheer desperation, it did the unthinkable — launch two vegetarian items on the menu, Veg Twister and Vegetarian Zinger, the vegetarian version of its famous Zinger burger. As if that was not enough, it went a step further and got a new tag line way while driving sustainable profitable growth. Any new restaurant openings will be keeping in mind our long-term view and overall profitability,” says Menon. With the help of steady investors, renewed focus on chicken, and newfound emphasis on delivery, KFC seems far from the gloom not so long ago. What's a chicken without wings.(Graphics by Ankita Mehrotra and Abdul Shafiq)

Santosh Sagre runs a cosmetics store in Nandre, a small village in Maharashtra's Sangli district. Sagre is the go-to man for locals looking for relatively high-value personal-care items: Pond’s talcum powder, Pears soap, Fair & Lovely cream, or face wash. Now, Sagre's loyal customers can also buy smartphones from him. The catch is, he doesn’t stock any.He the glass counter, where a shopkeeper will hand it to you. He’ll let you pay by card, even scan the Paytm code, and he’ll have an electronic billing system. And of course, it can all be delivered to you for a minimum purchase order. Maybe even on credit, if the guy running the store knows you well enough.

KIRANAS TROUNCE WALMART-AMAZON-DMART 9-1: HOW THE SMALL GROCER KEEPS WINNING BIG

Indranil Mukherjee/AFP/Getty Images; Arterra/UIG/Getty Images

December 2012. The BJP is in the opposition. The Congress-led government is about to introduce foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail. Word is, Walmart, the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer, is keen to bring its big-box stores to India. The BJP hates the idea. During a debate, the opposition’s chief whip Sushma Swaraj lays into the government: “Small shops [and] contributor? Households with annual incomes of INR10 lakh onwards. There is an opportunity for kirana stores to carve a slice of these digitally influenced spends, but grabbing it calls for a change in the way they have operated for decades. How they are making that shift is the next part of this story. (Graphics by Abdul Shafiq and Ankita Mehrotra)

ATTENTION HIPSTERS, WE’VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU: KINGFISHER IS STILL MOPPING THE FLOOR WITH YOUR FAVOURITE BREW

For a king, said Machiavelli, it’s better to be feared than loved. Achieve both, and you’ve probably sealed the kingdom for good. Hari (name changed), who mans the counter at a bustling liquor store in a posh Bengaluru market, gives a somewhat cagey demonstration of this when we ask him if Kingfisher still dictates terms in his business. “ investments worth INR100 crore to INR200 crore, based on capacity.”Apart from its balance-sheet strength, there’s Kingfisher’s legendary distribution network. “Kingfisher is one brand that you will find in every corner of the country,” says the former industry executive. It’s at the heart of the unmatched negotiating power the name still commands at retail stores. Ask Hari.

CAN PATANJALI DO AN AMUL?

Baba Ramdev, inflation fighter. Via milk. Nope, we didn’t make that up. Last Thursday, amid cows in a packed Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi, the founder of Patanjali announced that the company was finally launching its range of milk and milk products, starting with the Delhi-NCR region. The launches included milk, dahi, paneer, chhaas (buttermilk), and frozen foods like up the right focus area: the supply. Up next will be scaling that supply by securing dairy farms across the country and ramping up distribution enough to match the muscle of the likes of Amul and Mother Dairy. That’s a hard position to get into. Even for the uber-flexible Ramdev. (With inputs from Prashant Mukherjee)(Graphic by Ankita Mehrotra)

You know an industry desperately needs to hit reset when there's a demand to change its very name.“I wish it wasn’t called ‘breakfast cereals’,” says Prashant Parameswaran, the young founder and managing director of Bengaluru-based Kottaram Agro Foods. “This is a snacking… a 4pm solution. The larger trend in India is snackification. It’s the on-the-move, on-the-go space. in FY16. The lesson for new biggies — like Nestle’s recently launched NesPlus — then is also to focus on children when turning a cereal into a snack. Getting adults away from impulse, unhealthy snacks made by the likes of Haldiram’s and PepsiCo might be a taller order than convincing parents to feed their kids something healthy, tasty, and trendy.

WHAT FUTURE GROUP KNOWS ABOUT PLUS-SIZE FASHION THAT OTHERS DON'T

Plus size models walk the ramp during ALL Primero by Wendell Rodricks; image courtesy: Lakme Fashion Week

For most Indians, asking our American uncles to bring us stuff during their annual trips home ended about 20 years ago. Not for Norah.“I order my clothes mostly from the US. None of the Indian brands have my size. And if they do, they are often not stylish enough,” the professor from Delhi University says.

Few things induce greater pathos than filmy folk selling make believe outside the theatre. Like traditional studios claiming they can continue their reign in the world of Netflix and Amazon, courtesy their decades-old movie libraries.Take Hiren Gada, CEO of Shemaroo Entertainment. “We have created a formidable, arguably the largest, repertoire of films,” he says. “We have films from the 1950 participate in this market. Their films will be acquired by those with the biggest muscle, and their libraries will have little to offer in a world where consumers are acquired with original content made just for them. As D’Souza puts it, “The player with direct access to the consumer will drive India’s OTT business.” (Graphic by Ankita Mehrotra)

INDIA’S ORGANIC FARMERS SUPPLY TO THE WORLD, BUT CAN’T FIND SUPPORT AT HOME

When Amazon spends USD13.7 billion to get into a business, you know it isn't a fad. For the organic-foods business, the moment of truth came last year, when Jeff Bezos’s company decided to buy Whole Foods, the industry's biggest name. India's organic-farming community could have had plenty of reasons to get excited by the news: After all the country, can dump anything into the country. “The WTO [World Trade Organisation] forbids separate standards for domestic production and imports of the same product. So, the FSSAI may be pushing compulsory standards in India to prevent dumping from neighbours like Bangladesh, who could even sell non-organic foods as organic here in the absence of any compulsory standards.”(Graphics by Ankita Mehrotra)

HINDALCO-NOVELIS-ALERIS: AL’S WELL THAT ENDS WELL

In 2007, when Hindalco acquired Novelis for USD6 billion in a bid to expand its global footprint, the markets reacted negatively. Their concern? The price was too high. Also, Novelis had high debt. It was a different deal structure compared with the leveraged buyout the markets had seen in the Tata-Corus deal. But by 2010, the story had changed. Novelis was considered Hindalco can integrate the company well and manage the debt, the deal still makes sense. The key point is that Hindalco is a strategic partner that would want to maintain its leading, global position unlike a financial investor who would just weigh the numbers. Hindalco turned around Novelis. And it can do it again with Aleris.(Graphics by Ankita Mehrotra)

This was after the company secured an order from the Delhi High Court. The tweet was removed under PepsiCo's order soon after, but plastic and Kurkure decide it does not want to talk about it at all. In this case, you would want to change the conversation completely,” says Raj.“For example, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola may not want to have a conversation on sugar. So, they would work to have a conversation around healthy foods instead, where they can talk about their portfolio of health-related brands.”

WHY THE POPCORN AT THE CINEMA JUST APPEARS EXPENSIVE. IT REALLY ISN'T.

The nachos are too salty. The cola should have had more fizz. The ketchup is too sugary. The reviews were great but the movie is boring.The popcorn … umm … it is buttery, lightly salty. You order it and get the sticker shock; 200 bucks for this!Humanity is willing to suffer many inequities, but getting overcharged for popcorn violates our sense same for cinemas.So, why do you still feel that the movie theatre is ripping you off? This could be because you allowed a monopolist to riffle through your wallet and pick the best notes. The only thing that could change that feeling is the movie turning out to be great. Or else that home-made sandwich will taste miserable too.

Or their more sugar- and carb-infused alternative, energy bars.Do you know how many protein-bar brands are available in India? At least half a dozen homegrown ones, including Delhi's Feel Mighty protein and essential nutrients, endorsed by international paediatricians. For what it's worth, GSK-CH India's latest annual report (FY17-18) mentions "protein" 13 times versus just five times in the report from a year earlier. The earliest available report, from FY2001-02, mentions protein only twice, as a matter of industrial disclosure of manufacturing capacity. Management discussion does not bring it up.

WHY HORLICKS ISN'T TALLER, STRONGER, SHARPER ANYMORE

From Unilever to Coca-Cola, F&B biggies are said to be eyeing the once-glorious brand, but they might be going after a dead end. The story of Horlicks is also one of how India changed. Part 1 of a two-part series.

You know what’s a weird place to discuss Horlicks? The Hacker News portal of YCombinator — the incubator of Airbnb and Dropbox — better known for topics like ‘Qt for Python available at PyPi’.Listen to PraneshP, a forum member who says he is from south India: “When my dad had a heart issue in 2003, his doctor strictly told him to is Horlicks the right choice to achieve any of these goals? It’s not the advertising crimp (or the rise of paneer) alone. Horlicks has been affected by a deep shift in distribution channels and the sudden assault of protein and plant-based products that have fundamentally changed the nutritional-supplements industry in India. More on that in part 2 of the story.

HOW TO SET UP SHOP IN INDIA

What's happening? A horde of foreign brands, large and small, are making their way to India's fashion market. Last year, Franchise India said almost 50 global retailers were planning to set up shop in India, including Greek footwear brand Migato, Japanese denim wear brand Evisu, and Greek personal-care brand Korres. Last month, Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo said it was going to instead of investing in a full team, a country manager, and so on," Malhotra says. "[However,] if you're looking to sell a "masstige" brand (mass-prestige), and you want to open 50-100 stores in the country, then it makes sense to do it on your own. The fixed costs are worth incurring over that scale in the long term," adds Shrikhande.

HOW THE MIRAGE OF GST REFUNDS HAS LEFT EXPORTERS IN DIRE STRAITS

Textile traders in Kolkata striking in protest against GST in 2017; Debajyoti Chakraborty/NurPhoto via Getty Images

It all started on July 1, 2017, as the government rolled out the goods and services tax (GST). Things were supposed to be simple and seamless with not too many taxes — at least that’s how the story was sold. Firms exporting goods from India were told to pay GST on the products they exported and later claim a refund. They also in the value of exports across the spectrum. The worst hit industries are textiles, apparel, and gems and jewellery. But then, these sectors are highly unorganised and have always had a bad track record of tax and regulatory compliance. This leaves us with another unanswered question: Where will the GST mess leave the government’s war cry — Make in India?

CAN TATA CHA DO WHAT TATA STARBUCKS DID IN INDIA?

The Tatas are back in the tea-room business after a shuttered foray a decade ago. This time, they will be up against Chaayos and Chai Point, which have built the market up from the ground. Here's an early report.

Shabori Das

Friends, banter, and meetings. That's how we perceive coffee shops, or at least did when Café Coffee Day started to change India’s coffee culture in the early 2000s. Almost 20 years on, and six years after the world’s biggest coffee-shop chain Starbucks entered India in partnership with the Tatas, these joints have become as popular as venues to talk in this area. "Tata Cha may have entered late, but what will work in its favour is its store design," he says. "Furthermore, Tata's tea is consumed by everyone in the country. We know the taste. It's consistent with what we expect from our tea. Combine that assurance with an ambience to match, and the footfalls will follow," Francis says.

UNILEVER HAS A FOOD PROBLEM

The company’s recent move to club its foods and refreshments businesses may not yield much, considering the intense competition in those categories. While it is trying to change the game around, there are significant challenges ahead for reorganising the business.

Sanjiv Mehta, managing director and CEO, Hindustan Unilever Limited; timescontent.com

Last week, India’s largest packaged consumer-goods firm, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), recombined its foods and refreshments businesses, just about two years after separating them. Both decisions were prompted by the global parent Unilever. Both HUL and its parent firm have had trouble with their foods business, and the ongoing restructuring shows that the company is currently depending on better-entrenched, foods and refreshments business will help HUL increase organisational agility and better serve local consumers while harnessing the advantage of global scale," an HUL spokesperson says via e-mail. "Our foods business continues to deliver strong volume growth focusing on core categories. We have successfully landed innovations which will be critical to tap into a fast reshaping landscape of packaged foods."

If you sell fast fashion in India, nothing spells the kiss of danger quite like your target customer recoiling from you because you are "expensive".When global faves Zara, Forever 21, and H&M came to India — the first two in 2010 and the last in 2015 — the Indian fashion buyer was jubilant. Fast fashion, it seemed, was tailor-made for India. Trendy . With retail behemoths like Amazon and Walmart throwing their might behind their own labels, fast-fashion companies might be in for a long, hard pricing squeeze.(An earlier version of the story stated that H&M India had declined comment. The company had, in fact, shared its financials for the story, though it declined our request for a detailed interview.)

At the peak of India's consumer boom, around a decade after liberalisation, talk of two countries-in-one became common in business circles. One was India, living in the cities and enjoying the fruits of a more open economy and the foreign investment it brings. The other was Bharat, the forgotten rural hinterland that still relies on unstable monsoons for income and on listed consumer firms published on April 5, equities brokerage firm Jefferies recommends investing in consumer discretionary stocks over those of consumer staples. Jubilant Foodworks, owner of the Domino’s quick-service restaurant franchise, and Asian Paints, India's largest paints firm, are getting their nod over major consumer staples firms like Britannia and Colgate-Palmolive (India). The reason? These stocks are still overvalued.

SUBSCRIPTION RETAILING, THE NEW (OLD) CHANNEL FOR REPEAT SHOPPING, IS BLOOMING IN INDIA. BUT IT MUST WATCH OUT FOR DANGEROUS TURNS.

From diapers to sanitary napkins and juices to luxury products, there's a subscription box for everything. The Indian customer is slowly getting hooked and companies are gung-ho. But they would do well to heed the cautionary tales from more advanced markets.

Raw Pressery

Don’t underestimate the power of diapers. In April 2016, Amazon quietly launched its popular Subscribe and Save store in India. A key customer segment it guns for is the newly minted urban family — think busy first-time parents whose biggest horror is to wake up in the middle of the night and discover an empty diaper packet."My wife opted for that talisman of modern retail: Jeff Bezos. Amazon’s other subscription service, Amazon Prime, which bundles economical delivery of products and its video-streaming service, is a big hit in India. "Prime added more members in India in its first year than any previous geography in Amazon's history,” Bezos wrote in the company’s annual report.Bring on the juice bottles.

OASIS IN A DEAD MALL: THE DECATHLON PLAYBOOK

Several of the sports-goods seller’s humongous warehouse-type showrooms are in malls. How does it manage to bag such sprawling real estate? The trick lies in finding a ‘dead’ mall, taking up a huge anchor space at a discount, and reviving the mall itself in the bargain.

A THORNY GST REGULATION IS HURTING FMCG COMPANIES. HOW FAIR IS IT?

Victoria 1/Shutterstock

What is happening? One of the more contentious provisions in the goods and services tax (GST) framework is coming home to roost: See-sawing GST rates from last year have created a shadow of “profiteering” on India’s consumer-goods companies. The government has begun asking firms to pay up for having made undue profits by not lowering the prices of several ” off lower tax rates. This is because, as noted above, the anti-profiteering law does not specify how and by when prices should be dropped after taxes are lowered.However, companies seem to have reconciled to the regime for the time being — most have already made back-of-the envelope calculations on how much they might owe in “profiteered” margins, this source says.

WHY VIDEOCON GIVING UP PHILIPS AND ELECTROLUX MAY BE TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE

Sean Gallup/ Getty Images

What happened? Last week, the Economic Times reported that beleaguered consumer-durables firm Videocon is mulling giving up its licence to make and sell televisions under Dutch brand Philips and appliances under Swedish brand Electrolux in India. An e-mail questionnaire and text messages sent to Videocon managing director and CEO Venugopal Dhoot did not get a response. We will update the with banks,” he adds. Bottomline? Videocon is trying, as banks drag their longstanding NPAs to court under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. In January, the promoter group sold some shares of Videocon Industries, held by associate companies, in the open market. But just like the return of these licences, that too barely made a dent in the company’s troubles.

POLIO VIRUS TO INDIA: THE NEWS OF MY DEATH HAS BEEN GROSSLY EXAGGERATED. HELLO AGAIN!

Bio-Med supplied 150,000 doses of a polio vaccine tainted with a deadly strain of virus that was eradicated in 2016 after decades of effort. The result: a silent contagion that could play out over the years. There has been no public advisory from the government, as if to say: Keep calm and carry on.

Health ministry should get ready to call him for another tour of duty because the old foe (of Indian childhood) seems to have returned. All because of gross negligence by one company that makes polio vaccines.SP Garg, the founder and managing director the manufacturing of vaccines says the bulk actives or raw materials of the vaccines are imported and processed or reformulated into smaller packs in India. In the case of Bio-Med, the type 2 virus may have been left undestroyed or had stayed in an impure form. Later while processing of the final packs, this strain may have moved into the packing.

One of the messages exchanged among executives of drug companies said, "It is not about Sun Pharma, Indian pharma has done. In the future it will have to take up much more complex manufacturing in biosimilars and innovative drugs. The world will source from India only when it knows that the medicine is what the doctor ordered. And to get there, Indian companies will have to ensure 24x7 readiness for a surprise visit by the USFDA investigator.

And Nuziveedu Seeds, a relatively tiny hybrid-seeds company another disruption. The setting here is much like the pharmaceutical industry about a decade ago.

NSEL investors stage a protest outside the office of the Economic Offences Wing; NSEL Investors' Forum via Facebook

It's five years to the day that the payment crisis at the National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL) broke out. Probes by investigative agencies and judicial proceedings have followed since, but investors have received little relief. Against over INR5,300 crore of investor funds still stuck with defaulters, only about INR19 crore has reached the escrow account formed to route payments to of time and effort. It is therefore proposed to adopt the approach taken by Forward Market commission which directed NSEL to distribute money to investors through whom the investors had made the initial investment.”Though NSEL has obtained decrees against many defaulting members, enforcing these and recovering the funds amid multiple investigations is likely to take its own sweet time.

"All places in the country have one Diwali. Beas has unnees (19) Diwalis," says Ved Prakash Batra, a key functionary of the Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB).

INSIDE THE RADHA SOAMI SATSANG

ET Prime travelled to the sect’s Dera in Beas, exploring it beyond the themes of spirituality and religious belief. What we found was a mini city with well-laid houses, hostels, a shopping mall, an airstrip, and a hospital – managed by one of the largest landlords in the country.

"Genuine Leather Stores" says the sign on shop number 115. It is a nondescript place on the first floor of Yashwant Place in Delhi. The shopping complex has small eateries selling sizzlers, momos, Tibetan food, and chhole bhature. The iconic Chanakya movie hall has taken a new avatar as the towering PVR ECX, adding a tinge of glamour to the old Dhillon, the wife of Gurpreet Singh Dhillon and daughter-in-law of the master, used to own two-thirds of this company. She has since sold the Vichitra shares to the Godhwani family. In a reverse move of sorts, two satsangis, Bhagwan Bhojwani and Sonu Motwani, became directors in Arctic Investments. The registered address of Arctic Investments till recently? Shop number 115, Yashwant Place.

On October 24, 2016, Cyrus Mistry, the then chairman of Tata Sons, had a visitor, Ratan Tata, his predecessor. It was a surprise visit. What Tata had to offer Mistry that afternoon was even more surprising. It was a devil’s alternative: quit or get sacked. This set off a board game. In the following weeks, Mistry was ousted from the board in corporate governance."In the Tata-Mistry battle, irrespective of the outcome, there will be a dash to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal for an appeal. Though lawyers feel there will be something in the judgment for the minority shareholders, which might revive faith in the system, they wonder how strong this would be. Today those answers should be forthcoming.

When the Pope dies, cardinals lock themselves up in the Vatican and start the tortuous process of electing the next one. The anxious public waiting outside learn the outcome from smoke coming out of a chimney. Black smoke: no result. White smoke: Hallelujah.For Fortis watchers, the process of finding an owner for the troubled hospital chain has been no of Fortis. Fortis has denied the charge. The company has also received four notices claiming total financial liabilities worth INR253.44 crore, which it has denied. The matter is pending in court. Fortis is yet to make provisions for potential losses arising from the above. Till it puts all this past itself, expect more smoke, even if it does change colour.

There's a mini battle brewing at Bharti Telecom, the holding company of telecom major Bharti Airtel. Its plan to "extinguish”the shares of nearly 5,000 small shareholders has drawn the latter's ire.In a relatively rare corporate manoeuvre, the privately held Gurugram-based company has issued a notice for postal ballot/e-voting, open till the end of this month, seeking shareholder approval capital reduction to provide an exit opportunity to small shareholders following several requests from them.Holding on to shares that are perceived valuable against odds is perceived as a virtue among small investors. This development will make them question whether staying invested for the very long term, especially defying the larger plans of a promoter-dominated company, is a wise idea.

Clearly, a lot.
