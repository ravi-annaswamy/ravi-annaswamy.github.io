PS4 Pro

The latest console from Sony, the PS4 Pro is the most powerful console on the market right now and can output both 4k and HDR Video thanks to its upgraded GPU. Critics describe its improvement on the PlayStation 3 as significant, particularly highlighting the amount of high-speed memory and the impressive graphic technology.

While it doesn’t feature a 4K Blu-ray drive, much to the disappointment of loyal fans, its 1TB hard drive more than makes up for it. The PS4 Pro also supports Remote Play, Share Play and streaming at up to 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second – that’s seriously fast.

The Independent's technology editor Andrew Griffin, and avid gamer, has weighed in to explain the major differences, and help you choose the most suitable console for you.

Nintendo Switch v The Rest

To get this out the way: the Switch is an entirely different proposition, but one that’s not worth ruling out.

The games are incredible, the console is packed with fun, and Nintendo have pulled out a stroke of genius all around. It has its downsides – the graphics and performance are nowhere near as futuristic and powerful as the other bigger consoles – but that’s what you get for it all fitting in a box you can throw in your bag and play on the move.

Ultimately, you’re probably not deciding between a Switch and other consoles; but if you’re deciding whether to buy a Switch, then you should.

Instead, this guide is about whether you should buy an Xbox or a PlayStation, and which of those you should buy. Here’s everything you should think about.

Console Exclusives

First, have a look at the various console exclusives that each platform has. If you want to play any of the Halo games, for instance, you’re going to want to get an Xbox; if you’re really into Final Fantasy, then you’ll need a PlayStation. But remember that almost every big game comes out for both consoles, so unless there’s something you’re especially keen on then that might not necessarily sway your decision.

Special Features

Second, think about exclusive features and products. The PlayStation for instance has virtual reality features, and good ones; the Xbox hasn’t got round to that yet. On the other hand, the Xbox allows you to play games on the PC, too, and the Kinect is still clinging on. But ultimately this comes down to VR – if you’re interested in getting your hands on a headset as soon as possible, the PlayStation wins out.

What Are You Used To?

Third, have a think about the different controllers, and what you’re used to. This, in my opinion, is the big thing that’s underappreciated about the differences between the Xbox and the PlayStation – which is strange when you consider that it’s the thing that’s most obviously different, about something that sits in your hands the entire time you’re playing. The Xbox controller is bigger, tougher and more comfortable; the PlayStation one is smaller and some people find it to be a little more agile. This ultimately comes down to what you’re used to, so if you’ve played one console through all previous generations then it might be worth sticking with what you know.

Branding And Design

And last of all comes the wooliest of all considerations – but the one that will probably make a difference. Think about the branding, design and look of the consoles, both hardware and software. From the outside, the PlayStation is a little less sleek, all tumbling lines and curves; the Xbox is significantly more square and a little more contemporary. Once you boot it up, the PlayStation is more of a swirl of colour and beeps; the Xbox is a little more practical and down-to-earth.

PRINCESS EUGENIE RELEASES UNSEEN PHOTO FROM ROYAL WEDDING

Princess Eugenie has released a never-before-seen photo from her wedding day to Jack Brooksbank, showing the pair in a loving embrace after exchanging their vows.

The couple married on 12 October at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, the same location where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were married five months before.

Princess Eugenie shared the photo on Instagram yesterday just over a month after her wedding, with the caption: “#tbt to THE greatest day of my life.”

In the photo Princess Eugenie can be seen wearing her ivory wedding gown, which was designed by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos.

The dress featured a neckline that folded around the bride's shoulders and a low back design at her request.

Princess Eugenie specifically chose to wear a dress with a low back for the royal wedding so that the scars on her back that she acquired after having an operation at 12 years old to correct her scoliosis would be visible.

She spoke about her decision to have her scars visible prior to her nuptials, explaining that she wanted to raise awareness for the condition.

"It's a lovely way to honour the people who looked after me and a way of standing up for young people who also go through this," Princess Eugenie said during an interview on ITV's This Morning.

"I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it's really special to stand up for that."

A number of people have been expressing their admiration for the newlyweds under Princess Eugenie's Instagram post.

"What a gorgeous photo!!!! You two are simply beaming with happiness," one person wrote.

"You looked absolutely stunning on your special day! But more than that, your happiness was visible," another well-wisher commented.

"Congratulations and [wishing you] a lifetime of friendship, health, happiness and love."

ONLY HALF OF MEN SAY A KISS COUNTS AS CHEATING

Cheating means different things to different people.

For some, it’s a flirty encounter or a lusty text, while others have far more liberal approach, seeing only the most blatant forms of adultery as valid, like sleeping with someone else.

According to new research, it seems that half of young men fall into the latter category because, unlike 73 per cent of women, they don’t class kissing as cheating.

The same number also said they didn’t think cyber sex counted either, compared to 75 per cent of women, who did.

Dating coach James Preece suggests that the findings might be in line with the different ways men and women typically broach intimacy.

“There's no way round this though,” he tells The Independent, explaining that regardless of your gender, if you kiss another person and don't think you’re cheating, it indicates a fundamental lack of respect for your partner and the relationship itself.

“If you don't care enough about your actions or how your partner will react, then you are with the wrong person,” he adds.

The survey, conducted by BBC Radio 5 Live, included data on 2,066 British adults.

True to what one might it expect, it found that 91 per cent of people would consider sleeping with someone other than their partner as cheating.

But the lines become blurred when it comes to more nuanced forms of intimacy, such as browsing on a dating app, which 40 per cent of respondents said counted as cheating.

The survey also asked people for their views on sex education, which is set to undergo its first revamp in 17 years, with no mention of cyber-bullying, LGBT+ issues, consent or pornography included in the current syllabus.

Clearly, it’s time for an update as 47 per cent of people said their school sex education didn’t prepare them for their sex lives.

5 Live’s Anna Foster said the findings shed light on the importance of improving sex education and tackling some of the taboos surrounding certain issues.

“Whether it’s the stiff upper lip or the ‘no sex, we’re British attitude’, as a country we’re just not comfortable talking about sex,” she said.

The findings come the same day the radio station launches its #sextakeover, when Foster will be joined by celebrity guests, including activist Munroe Bergdorf and TV star Vicky Pattinson, to discuss contemporary attitudes towards sex and dating for a special two-hour show.

“We’ll be talking about sexual health, relationships, sex and society and the future of sex,” Foster added.

“We’ll be joined by some big names, a live audience and special guests to get the conversation going.”

BARACK OBAMA SURPRISES WIFE MICHELLE WITH FLOWERS AT HER BOOK TOUR SHOW

Michelle Obama was in for a treat when her husband Barack made a surprise appearance at her book tour, presenting his wife with a beautiful bouquet of flowers on stage.

Michelle’s book tour for her new memoir Becoming has seen the former first lady go into great detail discussing her life with notable individuals including Oprah Winfrey, Tracee Ellis Ross and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

During the most recent stop of the tour on Saturday night, Michelle ventured to the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC to sit down for an in-depth conversation with former Obama White House advisor Valerie Jarrett.

As the pair began discussing Michelle and Barack’s relationship, Jarrett informed the sold-out audience that a special guest would soon be arriving on stage.

Lo and behold, the former president of the United States then emerged holding a bouquet of pink flowers for his wife, much to the delight of the crowd.

“You know when Jay-Z comes out during a Beyoncé concert?” Barack said as he walked out onto the stage, according to The Hill.

Jarrett then questioned the couple about the beginning of their relationship, asking them to describe their first meeting in 1989 at Chicago law firm Sidley Austin, during which time Michelle was assigned the role of Barack’s mentor.

“You know when you meet somebody and you feel like they get it?” Barack explained to the audience.

Many have wondered whether Michelle would ever follow in the footsteps of her husband by running for office in future, especially considering her eight-year residency in the White House and the enormous success of her book tour.

Television host Jimmy Kimmel decided to pose the question to her during her latest appearance on his show, with the former first lady providing him with an emphatic answer.

“It’s not something that I’m interested in or would ever do. Ever,” she said.

Michelle stressed her decision even further in her memoir, writing, “I’ll say it here directly: I have no intention of running for office, ever."

HAILEY BALDWIN APPEARS TO CONFIRM MARRIAGE TO JUSTIN BIEBER ON INSTAGRAM

Hailey Baldwin has seemingly confirmed that she and Justin Bieber have married by changing her name to "Hailey Rhode Bieber" on Instagram.

Following a brief romance from December 2015 to January 2016, Baldwin and Bieber began dating again in May 2018.

The American model and Canadian singer announced their engagement a couple of months later, and have now allegedly decided to take the next step by exchanging their vows.

In September this year, CNN reported that the couple had gone to a courthouse in Los Angeles to obtain their wedding licence.

While rumours began to swirl at the time regarding whether or not the couple had wed, both Baldwin and Bieber have now left clues hinting that they have in fact tied the knot.

"My wife is awesome," Bieber wrote in a caption on Instagram yesterday to accompany a photo of the pair holding hands, with Baldwin writing: "That's my babe" in a comment underneath.

In October, TMZ reported that Baldwin had filed to trademark the name "Hailey Bieber", while also claiming that the couple married in a secret ceremony in New York the day that they obtained their marriage licence.

However, in a now-deleted tweet from 14 September, Baldwin stated that she and Bieber hadn't wed at the time.

"I understand where the speculation is coming from, but I'm not married yet!" she tweeted, according to Bustle.

Numerous people on social media have been responding to the news of the couple's alleged nuptials.

"I'm so happy for them," one fan wrote on Twitter, with another writing: "You two are too cute ... I'm glad you found 'your person'," on Instagram.

SINGLES DAY: WHAT IS THE MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR CHINESE CELEBRATION AND WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

Every year on 11 November, thousands of people around the world celebrate Singles Day.

What started as an anti-Valentine’s Day celebration invented by young Chinese singletons has gone on to become the largest shopping day in the world.

In 2017, Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba generated a record $25bn (£19bn) in sales on the day itself, far exceeding similar annual shopping events, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

Here The Independent examines the phenomenon.

What is it?

An unofficial holiday that is primarily celebrated in China, it was created in 1993 as an antidote to Valentine’s Day, giving young Chinese singletons the chance to celebrate at events across the country and meet one another.

Major retailers quickly caught on to the fact that they could target young consumers by offering discounts across their stores and online.

It always takes place 11 November, a date which was chosen because of the sequence of 1s, which represent single people.

How did it start?

Thought to have originated at Nanjing University, it was initially only celebrated by men.

But the day soon became popular among young and single Chinese people, who saw it as an opportunity to meet other singletons and began organising events and meet-ups to mark the event.

It became the global shopping event it is today in 2009, when e-commerce giant Alibaba, who make the majority of its sales via apps, began offering special discounts on the day.

How much money does it generate?

Last year, Alibaba generated more than $25bn in sales, which is significantly more than in previous years.

This means the event is now almost four times larger than America’s biggest shopping days, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

CURVING IS THE LATEST DATING TREND YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT - AND IT MIGHT JUST BE WORSE THAN GHOSTING

From ghosting to benching, dating trends describe all the weird and woeful ways people behave in the realm of romance. Now, there’s a new term to worry about.

Introducing “curving”: when someone rejects you in a way that is so sneaky, you probably won’t even recognise it as rejection.

It's a way of letting someone down without actually telling them you're no longer interested.

Like most buzzy dating terms, it’s a form of behaviour most singletons will be familiar with, only now there's a word for it.

Curving can take many forms.

For example, one person may conduct their insidious curving habits via texting. Maybe they take days, or even weeks, to reply to your last WhatsApp message.

But instead of leaving you hanging (note: this is ghosting), a curver will reply, but their responses will be sporadic and often apologetic e.g. “I’m so sorry for the delay, I’ve just been really busy with [insert predictable excuse here]”.

Of course, they really might have been too occupied with work, family, friends, or the washing up to take a minute out of their day to craft a message to you.

But when this kind of behaviour becomes habitual, and you find yourself spending more time waiting for this person to reply then actually engaging in conversation with them, you know they’re taking you for a ride, and a curvy one at that.

Another crafty breed of curving is when someone goes one step further and convinces you that they really want to see you, but cancels at the last minute.

They’ll say things like: “I would love to hang out with you on Saturday, but I’ve got this [insert predictable excuse here] thing that I really can’t get out of. Let’s definitely do something soon though”.

So, you twiddle your thumbs and wait for “soon”. But, dear singleton, with a curver, “soon” will never come, and the longer you wait around for them, the more disappointed you’ll be when you realise they actually had no intention of ever seeing you.

“Curving is certainly a major problem that many of my dating coaching clients experience,” explains dating coach James Preece.

“Deep down, they know that the other person isn't that interested but they still hold out hope. They convince themselves that they are just having a bad day/week/month. If they can say the right thing they'll magically become keen again.”

When a person curves you, it’s usually their way of trying to cool things down without explicitly saying so, Preece tells The Independent.

“They don't want to talk to them but they don't know how to end it. It's easier to have short, boring interactions rather than directly state they don't want to see them. This is a lack of respect and only leaves the other person feeling sad and confused.”

Dating psychologist Madeleine Mason adds that people who curve often behave in this way to boost their own ego, because continuing to brush off someone who is romantically interested in them makes them feels more desirable.

But, she tells The Independent, ultimately it boils down to the person being curved to put an end to this behaviour.

“The person who keeps texting and accepting poor quality responses is at fault,” she says, advising anyone currently being curved to have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to behaviour, which can be both cruel and manipulative.

CONTROVERSIAL 'CONSENSUAL' SEX ROBOT BROTHEL CLAIMS TO BE WORLD'S FIRST

Since their conception, robot sex dolls, many of which are eerily realistic, have raised concerns about whether they could erode the accepted importance of consent.

Now, a company is attempting to address those concerns by creating the world’s first "consent-focused" sex robot brothel - where customers have to engage in conversation with the robots before having sex with them.

The brothel, which will be named Eve’s Robot Dreams if it opens, is currently in the crowd-funding stage, according to its Indiegogo page - but plans to open in California by 2019.

And the point, according to founder Unicole Unicron, a robot ethicist, is to “build a world where robots are treated with the respect they deserve, thus not contributing to a potential robot rebellion in the future.”

To ensure a harmonious relationship between visitors and their bionic partners, guests are required to get to know their robots before “spending time in a private setting” - either at Eve’s or before they arrive, via an app.

“Guests can begin building a relationship with their new companion by downloading the Realbotix app on their phone,” the site reads. “When they visit Eve’s they can either interact with the companion bot that they have already started to get to know, or with one who they haven’t met yet.”

If a customer prefers to flirt with their robot in person - prior to having sex with it - they can do so in the brothel’s cafe.

Once a “relationship” exists, however, the brothel will function like a typical one - with a private session costing customers $122 (£93) to have sex with a robot, or $10,000 (£7,600) if a customer wishes to be the robot’s “first.”

Dolls which cannot interact are also available for $60 (£45).

Despite the "consensual" aspect of the brothel, there are still concerns - especially with the virginity option, which has been referred to as "creepy" on Twitter.

But according to the campaign, the brothel’s “main concern” at the moment is sanitation and cleaning - as the robots must be properly sanitised prior to each new guest by staff.

To ensure cleanliness and safety, guests can also purchase their own vaginal or anus insert to place in the robots that is “theirs and theirs alone.”

As for the types of robots that guests will be able to have sex with at Eve’s, they represent the “current male-centric desires in the field of sex dolls,” according to Unicole Unicron, with Harmony, the robot face of Eve’s, created based on “the most commonly ordered body and face style at Real Doll.”

However, there will be various female "inert silicone sex dolls with robot heads" to choose from when Eve’s opens, according to the campaign, in addition to robots that have a female form and a penis.

Currently, the campaign for consensual android sex has raised just $2,634 (£2,009) with the help of nine backers - one per cent of the $155,000 (£118,265) goal.

PRINCE HARRY OPENS UP ABOUT ASKING PRINCE CHARLES TO WALK MEGHAN MARKLE DOWN THE AISLE

Prince Harry has revealed the heartwarming response that Prince Charles had when he was asked to walk Meghan Markle down the aisle, saying that his father agreed without hesitation.

Prior to the royal wedding in May, Kensington Palace announced that the Duchess of Sussex would begin the bridal procession at St George’s Chapel in Windsor on her own, before being joined by her future father-in-law.

When the Duke of Sussex asked if his father would escort Meghan down the aisle, Prince Charles apparently had no reservations about taking on the responsibility in Thomas Markle’s absence.

“I asked him to and I think he knew it was coming, and he immediately said ‘yes, of course, I’ll do whatever Meghan needs and I’m here to support you’,” Prince Harry says in a BBC documentary being released to mark Prince Charles’ 70th birthday.

“For him that’s a fantastic opportunity to step up and be that support, and you know he’s our father so of course he’s gonna be there for us.”

On the day of the nuptials when Meghan joined Prince Harry at the end of the bridal procession, the groom could be seen mouthing words of gratitude to his father.

“I’ve been brought up well, you’ve gotta say thank you,” Prince Harry says in the documentary.

“Just because he’s my father that doesn’t mean I can just sort of go, ‘OK, that’s all, I’ll take it from here.’ Err, no!

“Though that is what I wanted to say but I was very grateful for him to be able to do that.”

The original plan for the royal wedding was to have Meghan's father, Thomas Markle, walk his daughter down the aisle.

However, Mr Markle was unable to attend the wedding after reports emerged that he'd undergone heart surgery in the US following an alleged heart attack.

The statement released by Kensington Palace in May explained that Meghan had personally requested that Prince Charles walk her down the aisle following the news of her father's ill health.

"Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George's Chapel on her wedding day," it read.

"The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to the royal family in this way."

Prince, Son and Heir: Charles at 70 will be showing on BBC One on Thursday November 8 at 9pm.

MYSTERY COUPLE IN YOSEMITE PROPOSAL PHOTO IDENTIFIED AFTER VIRAL SEARCH

The US photographer who captured the viral snap of a mystery couple getting engaged at Yosemite National Park in California says he has finally identified them.

Matthew Dipple had stopped off at the famous landmark with his friend Josh as part of a road trip to Los Angeles when he spotted the proposal happening from afar.

He didn’t see any other photographers nearby and, as he already had his camera set up to take photos of Josh, decided to document the intimate moment in the hope that he could give the snap to the couple.

After taking the shots, Dippel rushed to Taft Point, where he’d seen the couple, but they had gone by the time he arrived.

The 24-year-old promptly shared the image on Twitter in a bid to track them down, writing: “Idk who these two are but I hope this finds them.

“I took this at Taft Point at Yosemite National Park, on October 6th, 2018.”

Now, after the tweet was retweeted more than 171,000 times, Dippel has found the couple, who have been identified as Charlie Bear and Melissa.

“Everyone meet, Charlie and his fiancé Melissa the happy happy couple that was out on the point in my Taft Point Proposal [sic],” he wrote in a tweet posted on Saturday.

“I’m glad I finally found you to share this special moment with you, thanks for being so awesome, maybe one day we will finally meet in person!”

Speaking to CNN, Bear said Melissa had come across the photograph on Instagram and quickly got in touch with Dippel.

The young photographer was initially sceptical because by that point, he’d already received thousands of messages from people falsely claiming to be the couple in the image: so, he asked for proof.

"They sent me over iPhone screen shots of some of their friends that were up on that point that day, and they are wearing the exact same thing, and the photos are timestamped on the exact same day and the same time that I was there," Dippel said.

"It just perfectly matched up to Charlie and Melissa."

Both Bear and Melissa have now posted the image to their respective Instagram accounts with captions thanking Dippel for tracking them down.

“We can’t thank Matt enough for all of his efforts in trying to find us!” wrote Melissa.

“I’m still trying to comprehend all of this and half of me still doesn’t believe this actually has gone viral online! We love you all!!

“Now off to wedding planning!”

The couple are due to wed in April in Malibu, California.

TAIWAN GAY PRIDE: BEST PICTURES FROM THE 2018 TAIPEI CELEBRATIONS

Thousands of people took to the streets of Taipei to march in the annual Taiwan Gay Pride Parade.

This year’s LGBT+ event took place a month before a historic vote on same-sex marriage, which is due to take place in the country on November 24.

The government ruled that same-sex couples had a legal right to marry in May.

It said that the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the state would come into effect after two years.

In February this year, an organisation who oppose the notion of same-sex marriage proposed that a referendum be held on the issue.

In the list of questions devised by the group, they ask voters to answer whether they think marriage should be defined as being “between a man and a woman.”

In response to the questions put forward by the organisation, a group who are in favour of same-sex marriage also put forward their own question to be included in the referendum.

Their question asks whether votes think the Civil Code should be amended in order to allow same-sex couples to marry.

The referendum will ask voters to answer a total of 10 questions on topics including LGBT+ rights, same-sex marriage, nuclear power and coal power.

In order for a referendum to pass in Taiwan, at least 25 per cent of the voters must vote in favour of the question.

There were approximately 137,000 people at the Taipei Gay Pride Parade, according to the event’s organisers.

Civil rights rights activist Chi Chia-wei was among those in attendance.

In 1986, Mr Chi became the first person in Taiwan to come out as gay on national television.

He made the announcement at a press conference, where he spoke about his sexuality and the importance of AIDS and HIV awareness and prevention.

The first pride march in Taiwan was held in 2003.

HALLOWEEN 2018: 18 OF THE BEST COUPLE COSTUMES TO WEAR WITH YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER

With Halloween just around the corner, now’s the time to put your creative hat on and start thinking about who or what you’re going to transform into for the spookiest night of the year.

While you could go it alone and devise a look that’s best suited for an individual, if you’re in a relationship, then why not opt for an inventive couple costume instead? It’s often said that two heads are better than one, after all (especially on Halloween).

Here are 18 of the best couple costumes to wear with your significant other during the annual ghostly celebration:

1. Carl and Ellie from Up

Carl and Ellie are officially one of the sweetest and most endearing couples in the history of cinema, so dressing up as them for Halloween could be a great way for you and your partner to demonstrate your love for one another.

Admittedly, this costume isn’t very scary, but it’s a winning costume idea for any avid Pixar fans.

2. Eleven and Mike from Stranger Things

Take a leaf out of the book of Modern Family’s Sarah Hyland by dressing up as the telekinetic Eleven and the adorably sweet Mike Wheeler from hit show Stranger Things.

With the second season of the show being released in October last year, many dedicated Netflix binge-watchers will likely be holding out hope for a third season to be released soon.

3. Hawaiian punch

Who doesn’t love a good pun?

Show some love for the English language (in addition to affection for your partner in crime) with this witty and undeniably cheesy costume.

4. The Doctor and the Tardis

Fans of Doctor Who have been showing the programme a lot of love since its triumphant return with Jodie Whittaker at the helm.

Among the Doctor’s many companions throughout the show’s 55-year history, one of the most popular pairings of the show is the Doctor and the time traveller’s faithful Tardis.

5. Tetris pieces

“You complete me,” Tom Cruise told Renée Zellweger in the 1996 film Jerry Maguire.

If you feel the same way about your other half, then show it by dressing up as pieces from the addictive 1980s arcade game.

6. Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction

Ever since Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction was released, couples have taken Halloween as the perfect opportunity to dress up as John Travolta and Uma Thurman and to recreate their famous dance scene from the 1994 film.

While this costume may be overdone, it’s a classic and very easy to replicate.

7. Baseball bat

Another punny costume, this time in the form of a popular American sport.

If you think your significant other is a catch, then this is the couple costume for you.

8. Katy Perry and Left Shark

While the media relishes writing about Katy Perry’s relationship with Orlando Bloom, one of her most iconic partnerships came in 2015 when the singer performed at the Super Bowl halftime show.

One of the most memorable moments of the performance came when a backup dancer, fondly known as “Left Shark”, was spotted dancing in an uncoordinated manner on the stage, spawning a myriad of memes.

9. Morticia and Gomez Addams

If you want to truly go peak Halloween, then donning the glad rags of Morticia and Gomez Addams of the Addams family is your best bet.

This couple has stood the test of time, first appearing in a television series in the 1960s.

10. Kelly and Yorkie from 'San Junipero'

'San Junipero' is one of the most highly rated episodes of science fiction series Black Mirror, winning two Primetime Emmy Awards in 2017.

Take inspiration from the 1980s by dressing up as the episode’s main characters Kelly and Yorkie, portrayed by Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Mackenzie Davis.

11. Jack and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas

In 2017, Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum succumbed to their daughter’s wishes by dressing up as Sally and Jack for Halloween, from Tim Burton’s stop-motion animated musical The Nightmare Before Christmas.

Considering Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King of “Halloween Town”, this costume is undoubtedly the epitome of the festive occasion.

12. Barbie and Ken

Two years ago, Beyoncé and Jay Z decided to dress up as Barbie and Ken for Halloween.

If this costume is good enough for one of the most influential couples in entertainment, then it’s good enough for you.

13. Harry Potter and the Golden Snitch

In Quidditch, the Golden Snitch is the most prized ball of them all, worth 150 points if caught by the team’s Seeker.

If you have no idea what any of those words mean, then this probably isn’t the costume for you and your significant other. However, if you’re a diehard Potterhead, then this look is definitely a Keeper.

14. Sully and Boo from Monsters, Inc.

Take a trip down memory lane by dressing up as Sully and Boo from Pixar’s Monsters, Inc.

All you need is some pink and blue clothing, some hair bunchies, some purple spots and some horns. Simple.

15. Harley Quinn and The Joker

Harley Quinn and The Joker have been a very popular comic pairing ever since Harley Quinn was introduced into the DC Comics universe in the 1992 animated Batman series.

Embrace the eccentricity of their relationship with this villainous Halloween costume.

16. Chuck Noland and Wilson the volleyball from Cast Away

In 2000, Tom Hanks was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Chuck Noland in the survival film Cast Away.

Wilson the volleyball, Chuck’s only companion while stranded on a desert island for four years, was received so well by film audiences that it has its own IMDb page.

17. Netflix and chill

Yes, this couple’s costume has been done a million times over and is unequivocally cliché.

However, if you’re lost for ideas, it’s a safe bet and very easy to create from scratch.

18. Marty McFly and Doc Brown from Back to the Future

Pay tribute to one of the most beloved films of the 1980s by dressing up as Marty McFly and Doc Brown from Back to the Future.

While the time-travelling adventure may have been released more than three decades ago, one of its stars, Christopher Lloyd, hasn’t ruled out another film in the franchise.

“I’d love to be in a fourth film if they could come up with the right idea that extends the story and does it as well as the first three,” he told Phoenix New Times earlier this year.

WHY STIS ARE ON THE RISE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE

They’re incredibly common, they rarely cause symptoms, and yet sexually transmitted infections (STIs) carry a notable stigma in contemporary society.

More than just an everyday taboo, research has found that the culture of shame surrounding STIs is preventing people from getting checked and leading to an increase in the spread of infection.

Now, data from Public Health England reveals that a young person is diagnosed with either chlamydia or gonorrhoea every four minutes in England.

Cases of gonorrhoea also rose by 22 per cent from 2016 to 2017, which experts put down to the emergence of a new strain of the infection which is resistant to antibiotics.

But the ubiquity of STIs warrants more than just a medical explanation: according to sexual health experts, there are a number of social factors at play too.

Despite being the only safe, non-hormonal form of contraception that protects against STIs, many people eschew condoms, with the SKYN Condoms 2018 Millennial Sex Survey revealing that just 56 per cent of men regularly use them.

Speaking to The Independent, Sarah Welsh, co-founder at condom company HANX, explains that men and women may be reluctant to use condoms because they feel embarrassed or awkward.

“Our research has found that people also worry condom use reduces pleasure and intimacy,” she adds. “Women in particular worry that they are seen as promiscuous if they use condoms.

“Others are put off by the tacky smell of regular condoms.”

Another key problem is the social stigma we attach to STIs themselves, explains Alix Fox, ambassador for Brook young people’s sexual wellbeing charity.

“Young people still believe that they’ll be able to tell if someone is carrying an infection just by looking at them,” she tells The Independent.

“They assume there will be discharge, a smell, lumps ‘n’ bumps, or some other visible clue that something’s up with a partner’s down-belows. Yet many STIs are masters of disguise.”

Indeed, the majority of STIs are symptomless, making it all the more important for people to get regular check-ups.

“People can look and feel A-OK for a long time whilst carrying an STI,” Fox continues, “and if they’re left to fester undetected, infections can lead to major health issues including pelvic inflammatory disease, reactive arthritis, infertility, swollen testicles, and a higher risk of miscarriage or stillbirth in pregnant women.”

The Unexpected Fluids host, who is also the face of ONE condoms, adds that a lot of people choose not to use condoms because they think any STIs they may contract will be easily-treated with a single pill.

“Whilst broad-spectrum antibiotics can treat certain STIs [such as chlamydia], other types cannot be cured, and can have effects for life.

“In addition, antibiotic-resistant strains are becoming increasingly worrisome. Prevention is always better than cure – especially when there may not be a cure.”

Meanwhile, other people may think they’re protected from STIs if they are using other forms of contraception, like the coil or the pill.

“Then there’s the still horribly prevalent belief that STIs – particularly HIV – are simply 'something that happens to other people’,” Fox continues.

“Nope. They can and do happen to anyone who isn’t practising safer sex.”

As for what can be done, Fox advises encouraging young people to become “condom confident” while raising awareness for the amount of free condom programmes that exist in the UK for under 25s, such as the C-Card scheme, which gives you free condoms in high street shops and chemists.

“Highlighting ways to make condoms feel better during sexual activity is crucial, too,” she adds, “as is letting people know about new design developments that bring bonuses such as increased sensation and comfort.

“Condoms can be so much more than a necessary-but-annoying chore; they can genuinely bring a host of benefits to the bedroom.”

HOW TO ESCAPE YOUR CONTRACT EARLY WITHOUT PAYING THE PRICE

Last week Ofcom announced it had fined two major mobile and broadband providers a combined £13.3m for misleading consumers over exit fees.

Virgin Media and EE were made to pay the sum after overcharging customers who wanted to leave their contracts early.

Such substantial fines may warn telecoms businesses against charging more than agreed without the watchdog stepping in. But consumers might not be convinced that they can switch contracts without facing unfair penalties.

So what are your rights if you want to escape a contract early, whether that’s broadband, mobile, utilities or even a gym? Is it ever possible to ditch a deal once you’ve signed up without paying substantial fees?

Rights and responsibilities

Customers do have rights to row back on contracts immediately after signing up. Stewart Croft, solicitor at QualitySolicitors AcklamBond, says: “Sometimes our plans for the gym can be a little too ambitious, which is why we can be thankful that all contracts entered into over the phone, online or at your home can be cancelled within a cooling off period of 14 days.

“After this cooling off period, it can be difficult to terminate a contract early unless a certain exemption applies.”

Those exemptions may include if the terms of the contract are considered unfair or if the service or product was mis-sold. But it could also be that the terms and conditions have changed.

But that relies on you noticing the change in time. Take broadband contracts, for example. Vix Leyton, from broadbandchoices.co.uk, says: “If you have a price rise that is above inflation and not within the terms of your agreement then you can typically exit without penalty, but to do this then you must pay attention to your post.

“They will notify you and give you a time period to switch, make sure you use that time effectively to shop around and vote with your feet.

“If with broadband, or any contract, the reason you are leaving is because you’re unhappy with the service then the first step is to talk to the provider. Lay out your problem rationally and follow the procedure they set out to you. If you follow these rules and are still unsatisfied with the outcome then you can open a conversation about leaving and negotiate terms. But give them the chance to rectify it – if it’s rectifiable.”

Keep talking

There’s not always legal recourse to escape a contract, so what if you need to leave because of a change in your personal circumstances?

Leyton says: “It is worth picking up the phone and having a conversation as you may be able to negotiate on a buy-out or move to a lower price package.”

It’s also essential to remain calm. Croft says: “Telephone the business to express your concern and ask what would be required to terminate the contract. Remember that this is a first conversation and, despite any existing reasons you may have to want to terminate, you should remain amicable. The cancellation team will usually ask why you wish to cancel and, more often than not, they will offer a cheaper or alternative package that might better suit your needs.

If you believe the cancellation terms are unfair or the charges excessive, you should write to the business, set out your detailed reasons for wanting to cancel the contract and make it clear that you will refer the dispute to trading standards if required.

“You should keep records of all correspondence as this may be necessary if you cannot come to an agreement. If you’re unsure about your consumer and contractual rights, you can also seek legal advice to find out what options may be available to you.”

Jonathan Compton, partner at city law firm DMH Stallard, says: “If there is a service failure on the part of the provider then complain and keep escalating the complaint.”

“If the service failure is serious and continues for a long period of time, the consumer may have a right to terminate the contract ‘for cause’. If there is no service failure, then read the contract you entered into and there may be a contractual right to terminate early.

“If there is no contractual right to terminate or this right is limited then consult a lawyer as there are legal provisions preventing unfair terms in consumer contracts.

“Whatever you do, do not just stop paying the bills. You will be on the wrong foot when dealing with the provider or the court. If all else fails, get in contact with the provider and cut a deal.”

Vix Leyton agrees: “Whatever you’re trying to exit, do not be tempted to just cancel your direct debits and hope for the best, this may end up resulting in collection agencies further down the line and damage to your credit rating. Have the conversation.”

To borrow from another telecoms business – it’s good to talk. Because then you can negotiate.

MILLIONS OF HOMEOWNERS WILL STILL BE PAYING OFF MORTGAGE AFTER RETIREMENT, RESEARCH WARNS

A fifth of the UK’s homeowners will still be paying off their mortgage after they stop earning, according to startling new figures that reveal the legacy of interest-only loans and delayed first-time buying.

Around 3 million people now expect to still be repaying their home loan after the current state retirement age of 65, research from online broker L&C Mortgages has found, in a break from the historic and often assumed norm.

High house prices, interest-only and part interest-only borrowing, and getting on the housing ladder later than previous generations all play their part in delaying the day homeowners pay off the last of their debts.

The average first-time buyer property is now over 40 per cent more expensive than it was just six years ago according to separate data from The Money Charity.

Today a third of mortgage holders believe they will be older than they had expected by the time they clear their debt – often because they’ve had to prioritise covering the costs of raising and supporting a family.

Creeping costs

Most worrying, almost 60 per cent of those who will still have an outstanding home loan in retirement have no plan for paying off their mortgage once they stop earning. It could leave huge swathes of the UK’s older generations facing a stark choice – try to find a new deal or risk losing their home.

The news comes in the wake of creeping pensioner poverty and despite a rising state retirement age.

A report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that almost 2 million pensioners are living in poverty alongside millions of those in work and those with young families.

“Over the last 20 years, the UK has dramatically reduced poverty among people who had traditionally been most at risk – pensioners and certain types of families with children,” the foundation reported. “But that progress is beginning to unravel; poverty rates for both groups have started to rise again.”

Understandably, anxiety among would-be retired mortgage payers over their long term financial security is running increasingly high.

Loan for life

In fact, one in 10 of those over 55 don’t think they’ll ever be mortgage free.

“The fact that people increasingly have to work beyond their standard retirement age to pay off their mortgage is a concern,” said David Hollingworth from L&C.

“Many will see a dip in income post-retirement which could pose affordability issues for older borrowers. Although homeowners will, and should, continue to aspire to pay off their mortgage before retirement, the reality for many could mean having a mortgage for longer.

“It’s clear that homeowners will shift their priorities depending on family needs. For example, so many first time buyers are reliant on the Bank of Mum and Dad. However there still needs to be a clear focus on the repayment of the mortgage, to avoid reaching a point that could force the sale of the family home.”

He added: “It’s not all doom and gloom however and people should assess their options and use the time before retirement to make a plan. The good news is older borrowers have more choice than ever, as the industry continues to innovate and cater for an ageing population.

“Lenders have become increasingly flexible in their approach to older borrowers and the retirement interest-only mortgage market is one that is only likely to see more growth.”

Interest-only ignorance

Almost 40 per cent of all those currently on an interest-only or part interest-only mortgage don’t believe they will be able to pay the remaining sum once their term ends.

When former interest-only mortgage holders have managed to pay off their loan, almost half relied on endowment policies and a third used savings or investments to do it.

These days though, stretched household incomes mean UK consumers are saving less than at any time in the last 50 years. With real wages still more than 5 per cent below the 2008 peak, millions of people have less than £100 in savings.

And yet the average outstanding mortgage among the over-65s alone – those who might expect to have the lowest levels of outstanding borrowing after a working lifetime of repayments – is £86,000. It’s up 13 per cent in the last three years, according to data from the Centre for Economics and Business Research.

But there may still be options out there. “Repayment of an interest-only mortgage that once seemed a million miles away may now be looming large for those that haven’t set capital aside,” adds Hollingworth.

“That may force the need to refinance and extend the mortgage term. Mortgage options for those that can demonstrate ongoing affordability are growing in number so it makes sense to seek advice sooner rather than later.”

THREE-QUARTERS OF BRITONS WORRIED ABOUT FINANCIAL SITUATION, SURVEY CLAIMS

Three quarters of people polled for a new survey were worried about their current financial situation.

One in five of the 2,000 respondents said they have no savings to fall back on in emergency situations.

Two thirds said they were worried about how they will cope if they lose their job or receive an unexpected bill.

“Money worries affect 40 per cent of UK employees," said Asesh Sarkar, the chief executive of Salary Finance, which commissioned the study. “For those that are already living payday to payday, the idea of something unexpected happening, such as a job loss or a large bill, can be a large source of stress.

“Saving for a rainy-day fund is difficult for many people, if it wasn’t everyone would have one. However, it can really take some of the pressure off and help avoid high cost loans, especially if something does go wrong, and reduce your financial worries.”

The study also found that one in four respondents thought they would struggle if they faced a long period of unpaid or statutory sick leave and 23 per cent would not be able to cope with the expense of a broken boiler.

Others were concerned about how they would pay for an unexpected car repairs bill (26 per cent), a large utility bill (22 per cent) or Christmas (17 per cent).

However, less than 14 per cent of respondents said they have less than £100 put aside for emergencies, while 39 per cent have less than £1,000 in their rainy-day funds.

The study also found that employed adults believe their savings would last them around five weeks if they were to lose their job.

One in 20 said they would struggle to last a week without being paid. But half of those polled say they have previously needed to rely on their savings to get them through a difficult period, with their funds lasting for 38 days on average.

A third say they been "caught out" by a large bill in the past, and did not have enough money set aside to cover it.

Over 30 per cent of the survey's respondents said they don't have a back-up plan in case they find themselves with little or no income.

Instead, 14 per cent said they use their overdrafts if they need extra money, while almost one in 10 said they use their credit cards.

Over 20 per cent said they ask for a loan from their parents or friends in emergency situations and over 30 per cent said they sell personal possessions at car boot sales or auction websites.

However, some of the survey's respondents said they also take money out for luxuries such as holidays. More than half said they thought they needed to make more effort to boost their rainy-day fund and 46 per cent said they "regret" not putting more money into their emergency fund.

While 29 per cent of those polled described themselves as a "saver", 17 per cent said they are a "spender".

If they had spare money, 37 per cent said they they would save it for when they really needed it, while 14 per cent said they would immediately "splash out" on something they wanted.

More than a third said would rather enjoy their money now than save it for something which might not happen.

HIGH HOPES FOR RENT-TO-OWN CLAMPDOWN BUT EXPERTS WARN UK’S POOREST WILL STILL STRUGGLE

The lowest income families could be protected from unfair contracts with rent-to-own businesses after the Financial Conduct Authority announced plans to cap the cost of goods, credit and add-ons sold “on the never-never”.

Following a successful campaign against payday loan companies that saw the number of these high cost credit businesses plummet, the FCA this week proposed a price cap that could save the UK’s most vulnerable consumers almost £23m a year.

Long criticised for charging up to four times the average cost for essential goods as well as eye-watering interest rates on the credit to pay for them, from next April rent-to-own (RTO) firms will have to benchmark the cost of products against the prices charged by three other retailers.

Businesses including BrightHouse, which was fined almost £15m last year by the regulator for failing to be a responsible lender, will also be prevented from charging more than the product’s value in credit charges.

The other lucrative side of the RTO industry – selling extended warranties alongside the products – will be subject to a two-day cooling-off period, which the regulator claims will effectively ban firms from selling these policies at the point of purchase from February 2019.

“Today’s measures are designed to bring down very high prices in the rent-to-own sector, which is used by some of the most financially vulnerable in our society,” Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said.

“A cap will prevent firms charging over the odds for essential everyday items like cookers or washing machines. We believe a cap is the only intervention that will effectively tackle the highest prices. If implemented it will save consumers up to £22.7m a year from excessive charges.”

But critics warn the measures fail to include late payment fees that can quickly spiral out of control.

“The measures are long overdue and will help, but you have to question whether a 100 per cent mark-up is acceptable,” added Andrew Hagger, personal finance specialist at MoneyComms.

“By comparison, the best personal loan rates for up to £2,000 are currently around 6.9 per cent.

“It’s a big shift in the right direction but, in essence, customers can end up paying double the retail price which still seems excessive.”

Fears remain for RTO customers whose circumstances regularly exclude them from the lower charge credit and cost of goods than mainstream consumers have access to.

Around two thirds of accepted RTO customers and declined applicants aren’t employed. They live in households with incomes of less than £18,000 a year and have precious little access to ready cash.

The FCA’s own study of the RTO market found that half struggle to keep on top of their bills and credit commitments with a quarter missing some form of non RTO payment, such as council tax or utilities bills in the last six months.

Most feel they have no other option available to them when it came to replacing essential items like cookers. Those that do are more likely to sell something else or borrow elsewhere to fund their purchase than use to a debit card or cash.

Only one in 10 RTO customers looked at alternative payment methods for goods before buying through an RTO scheme.

“The most financially vulnerable households cannot be left with no choice but the highest price on the high street,” said Peter Tutton, head of policy at debt charity StepChange, who welcomed the move.

“Fundamentally, we also need better alternatives for households who struggle to afford household needs, such as the cost of mending or replacing necessary household appliances.”

As consumer debt across all UK households hits the highest levels “in history”, debt charities and personal finance experts are now pinning their hopes on a government plan to introduce a no interest personal loan modelled on an established Australian product known as the “Good Shepherd” scheme, which has helped four out of five of its users avoid high cost payday lending.

Announced in the Budget last month, the UK’s version will be piloted next year, aiming to help the one million people who turned to high cost credit to cover basic living costs in 2017.

Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, added: “We also hope to see further action from the FCA in other areas of high-cost credit, including on logbook loans following the government’s disappointing decision to shelve the goods mortgages bill.”

HOW TO FIND YOUR IDEAL CURRENT ACCOUNT THIS NOVEMBER

Most of us take it for granted - the ability to access and manage our cash in a range of different ways, instantly. With household finances still firmly on the squeeze, we all need to make our money work harder for us, how ever we use it.

The current account is the bedrock of the UK's consumer, or retail, banking world but its place as the foundation of our financial lives makes us forget about it... those that can get an account that is.

Though the number excluded from this most fundamental of financial tools has dropped from a staggering 25% of low-income households in the 1990s, today around 5% still don't have access to a bank account.

If you're lucky enough not to be one of them, the chances are you've never moved yours in your adult life. Regardless of how impressed (or not) Brits are with the service, fees or rates on offer by our bank or building society, we just don't do it.

If it even occurs to us to shift our business, we fear lost direct debits, failed transactions and a paperwork nightmare. And yet, 99% of current accounts were switched in 7 days or less last year.

But its an expensive habit. Complacent providers are safe in the knowledge that their customers won't vote with their feet. And that makes for uncompetitive products that offer precious little benefit in return for decades of unwavering loyalty.

So how can you go about securing the best current account for your everyday money needs? As with so much in life, it really depends on what you’re looking for.

Current accounts defined

A current account is the most straightforward financial product available to British customers. It is held with a bank or building society and allows the account holder to access their money with the minimum fuss.

Facilities include the ability to withdraw money at no notice, deposit money simply and easily in cash, cheque or electronically, and set up consistent ways to pay bills and costs via direct debits and standing orders.

Not having one can dramatically restrict your ability to access and use your money - even earn it in some cases.

Comparing current account deals

They may have long been a necessity in modern UK life, but in 2018, having the best current account can be the difference between punitive charges and some lucrative gains, particularly when it comes to rewards for switching.

The Bank of England's base rate may have risen slightly from its historic lows finally this year, but nobody appears to have told the personal finance industry that.

You'll still struggle for a decent interest rate on your in-credit balance.

Cashback current accounts

That means the best way to earn cash on your current account is through switching.

The best deal for current account switchers is HSBC's Advance Current Account, offering £150 and a 6 month interest and fee free overdraft. There's another £50 up for grabs after 12 months when you register for mobile or online banking within 60 days.

You'll have to switch with two direct debits or standing orders to prove your commitment and deposit £1750 or more a month.

If that sounds like too many hoops to jump through there's always NatWest's Reward Account with its £125 cashback offer if you switch by 3rd December. There's also 2% cashback on household bills if they're paid by direct debit.

Receive a further payment of £50 after 12 months when you register for Mobile or Online Banking within 60 days of account opening.

Meanwhile, First Direct has gone down a slightly different route by offering switchers with at least £1,000 a month its 1st Account 'gift' worth 'up to £150' ranging from Fitbits to Amazon Echos and Polaroid cameras, even online courses.

Though if its cold hard cash your after, you could always open First Direct's regular savings account paying 5% AER.

Elsewhere, the best interest paying current account is the Nationwide FlexDirect account, which is the much talked about 5% interest rate for 1 year, on balances between £1 and £2500. After 12 months the interest rates drops to 1%.

Whoever you bank with, be sure your money is protected by checking the provider is part of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

All figures correct on 13/11/2018.

BEST CREDIT CARD DEALS AND INTEREST FREE CREDIT CARDS FOR OCTOBER

There's a month until Christmas and Black Friday is already upon us with its much-hyped spending frenzy.

You can almost feel your blood pressure rising, especially if you're already carrying an existing credit card balance into the festive season with you.

At a time when personal debt levels are at a record high it feels counter-intuitive, almost financially suicidal, to reach for a new credit card application. But you may be missing a trick.

Many debt-free die-hards consider them the devil’s best weapon in driving you into insurmountable debt, and around 18m people do indeed receive a default notice on their credit card bill each year.

But if used very carefully, credit cards could help manage your finances better thanks to interest free periods and balance transfer offers that operate like an interest free loan as long as you play by the rules.

Meanwhile, buying something with a credit card can afford you more protection than buying using a debit card or cash. Some credit cards are even designed to help those with bad credit to improve their credit rating, helping open the door to a whole range of other financial products they may not have otherwise been eligible for.

So where on earth do you start?

Credit cards explained

Long gone are the days of simply using a credit card to buy goods and services. Now, it’s all about working out the best credit card deals for your personal circumstances and needs. The best way to do a credit card comparison is to decide what you want from the offer and work backwards.

New purchases

If dipping your toe into the credit card pool is about funding a specific buy, you need a card offering the longest 0% interest free period on new purchases to give you every opportunity to finish paying for those expensive one-offs.

And that period can be more than two years.

Sainsbury's Bank is currently the best card for new purchases with a 29 months interest free deal on its Dual Offer Credit Card, though it reverts to 19.95% after that. The dual offer refers to the 2 nectar points you'll get for every £1 you spend on Sainsbury's shopping and fuel, plus 750 points every time you spend £35 in the first two months, as well as 1 point for every £5 spent elsewhere.

Or there's Barclaycard's Platinum Purchase Offer - which had topped the leader board until recently - with 0% interest on purchases for 27 months before charging 19.9% a year.

Clearly, if you've got specific spending plans, there are gains to be made - as long as you're religious about paying the balance off by the end of the interest free period.

The watchwords here are ‘paid off’ though. If you think it’s unlikely that you’d clear the debts even over two and a half years, you'll either need to be quick to transfer the debt at the end of the interest free period or else seek out the best long term low rate deal.

For some time now, MBNA’s 48 month offer at 4.9% interest for both purchases and balance transfers (with a low balance transfer fee of 0.5%) has been the best long term deal. Plus the interest rate rises to 'only' 8.9% at the end of the period.

Best credit card rewards and cashback cards

There's no doubt that big spenders who consistently pay off their balance either every month or at least by the end of the interest free period could be quids in by opting for a credit card that offers the best cashback deal or rewards.

If it’s cash you’re looking for, the American Express Rewards Low Rate Credit Card doesn't exactly have a catchy name or any interest free period, but it does come with a long-term interest rate of 9.9%, 5,000 'Membership Rewards' points when you spend £500 in the first three months worth £25 and 1 point for every £1 you spend on the card.

But if your rewards of choice don’t need to be all about the money in your pocket and can be more specific, such as Nectar points or M&S vouchers, they can be worth more than the cash return on your credit card spending.

For the best credit card rewards, it's all about the supermarkets. M&S, Sainsbury's, John Lewis/Waitrose, Asda and Tesco Bank credit cards offer rewards points when you shop with them, so your weekly shop could start giving you something back if you select wisely.

The best rewards out there at the moment come from the John Lewis and Waitrose Partnership card, offering 0% on new purchases for the first 9 months and giving new customers 3000 points worth £30 when they transfer a balance of £250 or spend £250 within the first 90 days.

It also offers an ongoing 1 point per £1 spent at John Lewis or Waitrose and 1 point per £2 spent everywhere else. Every 500 points you earn is worth £5 in gift vouchers to spend at either John Lewis or Waitrose.

Watch out though, the cost of debts remaining on the card after the 9 month introductory period rises quickly to 18.9%.

With all these reward or cashback cards, maximising your rewards is all about spending big but paying the balance back in full. If not, the interest and fees very quickly outweigh the benefits.

Whatever you do with these purchase cards, just don't get sucked in to the pricey position of having a long term debt sitting on the card.

If you do, it's time to transfer, and quickly.

Best balance transfer cards

Picture the all too common scene - the one credit card providers dearly hope you'll slip into.

You’ve already run up the debts and despite your best efforts to drive down your borrowing, have come to the end of your 0% interest deal before you've paid it off. Then it’s all about transferring the balance for as low a fee as possible, usually with the longest window of opportunity to kill off the last of your debt.

The truth is that you could have secured longer deals until recently, but with the powers that be scrutinising the way credit card providers target and deal with their customers, those days are probably over.

The good news though, is that the cost of switching your debt to the best interest-free deals - the transfer fee - appears to be plummeting among the top products.

Right now, the best balance transfer deal for those who need as much time as they can get their hands on to repay is the M&S Transfer Plus Offer Credit Card. It offers 0% interest on balance transfers for 32 months before reverting to 19.9%. Your transfer will only be subject to a 0.99% charge though.

Alternatively, and potentially cheaper depending on the balance you're transferring, is the Virgin Money 31 Month Balance Transfer Credit Card. The 0% deal on this card runs for 31 months before reverting to 19.9% but only carries a 0.85% balance transfer fee.

There's also Santander's 30 month deal with no balance transfer fee at all and even a 0.5% cashback deal. Climbing to 20.9%, the sting in the tail is that the whole thing comes with a £3 monthly fee, which could swiftly wipe out the benefits if you're not careful.

Best credit cards for bad credit

Credit card eligibility can keep you awake at night, but there are cards out there serving the same balance transfer and new purchase needs of those with bad credit.

This month, the best deal for those with a less than sparkling credit rating. is the Barclaycard Platinum Balance Transfer card. It includes a 0% transfer offer for 18 months, and a 0% deal on new purchases for the first three months, though it comes with a 2.99% balance transfer fee and is followed by a slightly alarming 24.9% interest rate at the end of the introductory period.

No matter what your circumstances, credit card preferences or spending plans, the golden rules are to be realistic about what you can afford to spend and ultimately repay, be disciplined about repayments by setting up a direct debit every month, and remember that credit card providers are out to make money, not solve your financial problems for you.

Always check the small print, especially annual charges, fees, and their rules on the order of repayments. Failing to do so could turn the best credit card deal out there into a very expensive affair indeed.

MONEY-SAVING EXPERT SHARES NINE TOP TIPS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BLACK FRIDAY

One of Britain's top money-saving experts has published a series of Black Friday hacks to help the country’s shoppers take advantage of the biggest deals.

Retailers are expecting a cash bonanza this weekend as Black Friday rolls into Cyber Monday - but there are ways shoppers can “beat the system”.

According to savings expert Emma Bradley, placing products in your “basket” the day before and clearing your internet browser history guaranteed maximum savings.

Ms Bradley also urged Britons to “know their rights” regarding the terms and conditions for Black Friday purchases.

Mainly focusing on tech products, due to the massive deals available, was also on her list of tips.

Ms Bradley, of mumsavvysavings.com, worked with AO.com ahead of their Black Friday sale to share some of the secrets behind the deals.

She said: “It may have started as a tradition in the US, but Black Friday has crossed the pond and is here to stay.

“The day has become an integral part of UK retailers’ marketing strategy to get us spending more, sooner.”

Ms Bradley suggested shoppers should fill their online basket the day before Black Friday, as this will often reserve items to stop them selling out.

She added: “The basket will also update the following day with the new reduced prices.

“Some retailers have gotten wise to this and empty baskets after a period of time but it could still be worth a try if you are researching the night before.”

She also stressed shoppers should know their rights if they change their mind about a purchase.

Ms Bradley said: “Under the Consumer Contracts Regulations, you can cancel an online order up to 14 days from the time the goods are delivered to you, therefore if you do change your mind you are still protected.''

Tech was the sector where the biggest deals were to be found, as people stock up on the latest phones and tablets for Christmas gifts.

Finding out when the best deals are about to go live was also recommended to make the most of the day.

“If you are doing your Black Friday shopping online, familiarise yourself with the times at which your chosen outlet releases or refreshes their deals,” Ms Bradley said.

“Once you are aware of the frequency at which the deals are updated you can set yourself a timer or alerts on your phone to come back at specific times if there is something you really want.”

However, she encouraged shoppers to stick to a budget and “manage the hype” on the day.

“I would encourage shoppers to plan ahead and create a list of what they are looking to buy to moderate their spending,” she said.

“Buying online can feel a bit too easy, as if we are not spending actual money, especially if our debit cards are automatically stored and we don’t even input the details. It is only when the money has left our banks that it feels real.''

BLACK FRIDAY: 90% OF DEALS ARE CHEAPER AT OTHER TIMES

You’re nobody’s fool. You won’t get sucked into the Black Friday hype.

You’ve got plans to purchase one or two particular items and then you’ll get the hell out of those online or high street stores as fast as humanly possible.

Except that even someone like you could still be duped by the consumer phenomenon that threatens to overshadow long-standing discount events like the Boxing Day sales. (Remember those? The ones that actually started on Boxing Day?)

The numbers involved are astonishing.

We’ll spend an average of £165 per household on Black Friday alone this year – around £4.5bn nationwide.

With spending plans up by 53 per cent compared with this time only last year, we’re especially looking for clothes, toys, games, small electrical items like food processors and coffee machines, and smartphones and tablets, according to research from GoCompare.

But if you add in Cyber Monday – the traditionally ‘online only’ sales day that has lost its distinction now that only a fifth of sales hunters will go to physical shops next weekend – our spending could reach almost £430 each over the four day sales weekend, according to a study by digital commerce platform Koomo. This year, with so many sales starting a week early, more than half of that will be spent before Black Friday even dawns.

Things have become so intense that half of those who plan to shop on Black Friday and Cyber Monday will take some time off work to do it. A quarter of shoppers are opting for a long weekend, and even those of us who are at our desks will still steal 20 minutes of company time deal searching.

Planned purchases

With a fifth of British consumers delaying a major purchase until next week’s sales events, half of us will shop Black Friday with a list, but a third admit they will ‘simply buy whatever deal seems the best, regardless of what the item is’, according to Koomo’s data.

Men are most committed to Black Friday, parting with £532 compared with only £312 for the average woman. By age group, millennials – splashing out an average of £650 each – will spend the most.

“Anyone who has seen news footage featuring someone with a trolley full of TVs and no real idea of what they’re going to do with them has seen what Black Friday can do to even the most sensible of shoppers,” says Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst for Hargreaves Lansdown, who notes that almost 60 per cent of us will overspend on Christmas this year.

“Most of us will overspend on Christmas, and for many people it starts with poor decision-making on Black Friday. It offers the perfect conditions to ensure we spend more than we want or need – creating a sense of urgency that leads us into poor decisions that cost a fortune.

“More than one in four people will put some of their overspending on a credit card. And while this may shield us from the true horror of our overspending for a month, when it eventually bites, we’re unlikely to be glad we spent more than we intended on things we didn’t really want.

“If your Christmas overspending gives you a £1,000 credit card bill (at 18.5 per cent) and you repaid at £50 a month, it would take two years to repay, and cost £185.

“If you fall into the credit card trap on Black Friday, there’s a good chance you’ll be ready to upgrade your technology purchases long before you’ve paid for them.”

Psychology of the spend

The more figures that emerge, the more ridiculous Black Friday spending becomes. In fact, we’re sucked in by five key features of this consumer event.

First, the hype surrounding Black Friday makes us predisposed to make a purchase. According to McKinsey, even before we have any idea of what’s on offer, 30% of us plan to buy something on the day. It means we’re more likely to spend money, even when there’s nothing really suitable on offer.

Then there’s the pressure inflicted by the artificial sense of urgency, limited deals that psychologically encourage us to place a higher value on a seemingly scarce item, and the fact that many items are ‘luxury goods’.

By having an expensive item on offer, and no cheaper discounted alternative, shoppers will persuade themselves that for a little extra cash they can trade up. This leaves them spending more than they intended, so they don’t actually save any money at all, according to Coles.

Above all, the time limit involved prevents us from shopping around to gauge whether the price on offer really constitutes a good deal or not.

In fact, what retailers really don’t want you to realise is that a staggering nine out of 10 of the most popular types of products are cheaper at other times of year.

A year-long investigation into pricing data and consumer demand across more than 21,000 products by shopping comparison site Idealo suggests that if shoppers can wait until Christmas Eve, more than four in 10 products will be cheaper than they are during the late November rush.

Of the top 10 product categories, Idealo found that only laptops were cheapest on Black Friday.

1. Drones – £149 cheaper on 26 September

2. Headphones – £37 cheaper on 17 August

3. Lego – £31 cheaper on 17 July

4. Laptops – lowest price on Black Friday

5. Smartphones – £72 cheaper on 5 August

6. DSLR cameras – £160 cheaper on 5 September

7. Games consoles – £65 cheaper on 25 October

8. Vacuum cleaners – £29 cheaper on 23 April

9. Tablets – £70 cheaper on 24 May

10. Washing machines – £60 cheaper on 27 October

Source: idealo.co.uk

And in the four-week run-up to Black Friday, 58 per cent of categories including Lego and games consoles are at their most expensive.

The average adult with children forks out £2,795 for Christmas – and a typical Briton puts in 75 hours of overtime to afford it all – according to myvouchercodes. So being in the know on Black Friday is “make or break” in more ways than one.

SHOULD YOU BUY A NEWBUILD HOME?

We’re finally building more homes in Britain. Not enough – the government says it wants to see 300,000 new houses built every year by the mid-2020s – but construction has really stepped up.

Recent data released by the National House Building Council (NHBC) shows that more than 43,000 new homes were registered between July and September this year, that’s the highest figure since the global financial crisis. So there’s a definite hike in housebuilding.

And a lot of the money to pay for those new homes is coming from the government’s help-to-buy equity loan scheme, which is to continue running until 2023. The scheme allows people to buy a newbuild home with a deposit of just 5 per cent and a government loan of up to 20 per cent.

However, there’s no clearcut case that buying a newbuild is comparable to buying an older property. Some people argue it’s worse; an overpriced and risky investment that may be a struggle to sell. Others say it’s a wonderful way to own a home, where the buyer can tweak and perfect the house and make it truly their own.

With so many first-time buyers and second-steppers being encouraged to look at newbuilds thanks to government support and the shortage of properties on the market, we’ve been asking if they are a good or bad investment.

The good

Jonathan Stephens, managing director of Surrenden Invest, says there are strong financial incentives to buying a newbuild, and they can make a real difference to how affordable homeownership is.

“Developers are often happy to offer a larger discount than private vendors,” he says. “For those buying in London and the surrounding area, the government’s help-to-buy scheme can also be particularly useful for first-time buyers.

“Newbuilds also come with peace of mind, in the form of the NHBC (or equivalent) 10 year warranty, which covers everything structural – from plumbing and wiring, to the roof. The appliances will also have their own warranties, usually for at least two years.”

And, of course, a new home is rather pleasant. It’s clean, it’s fresh and there’s no urgent need to spend even more money as soon as you move in chucking out the avocado bathroom suite. If buyers begin the process before the home is finished, they can even personalise how it’s decorated.

It’s also important to remember a newly built home benefits from all the latest energy efficiency technology, usually making them far cheaper to run than older housing stock.

Research carried out by the Home Builders Federation shows that more than eight out of 10 newbuild properties have the top A or B energy performance certificate rating, compared with just 2.2 per cent of existing properties.

That means newbuild homeowners will spend an average of £443.30 a year on energy and heating, less than half the £1,072 a typical older home costs to heat and power.

The bad

While there are some strong financial incentives for buying a newly built home, there could also be a significant downside.

Elliot Castle, CEO of Webuyanyhome.com, says: “Newbuild homes are as attractive as their computerised brochure images, however they come with a premium price tag. Just like buying a brand new car, the price of a property depreciates the minute you move in and they tend to only hold their price if you live in them for long enough.”

A common complaint with newbuilds is that the rooms are small, as developers work hard to include price-boosting amenities and a greater number of bedrooms.

Research from LABC Warranty published earlier this year showed that newbuild living rooms are almost a third smaller than similar homes built in the 1970s, and a study carried out by the University of Cambridge recently found that 55 per cent of UK dwellings fall short of the accepted internal space standard.

In fact, the UK has the smallest homes by floor area in Europe; the average newbuild home in this country is just 76 square metres compared with 137 square metres in Denmark.

Sam Mitchell, CEO of online estate agent Housesimple.com, says: “Developers are looking to maximise their profits, and that means bedroom and living room spaces are likely to be squeezed. Newbuilds often have smaller gardens, so that more properties can be packed onto a development.

“As for the hassle-free side of buying new, that doesn’t mean when you move in things won’t go wrong. It’s not unusual to end up with quite a long snagging list – such as cracks in plasterwork, appliances not working, loose bathroom tiles – to hand to the developer to sort out.”

The ugly

It was recently revealed that the government will launch a “Building Better, Building Beautiful” commission to ensure new developments are attractive and fit in with the character of existing communities.

But some commentators aren’t convinced. Writing in the publication Building Design, Julia Park, head of housing research at Levitt Bernstein, commented: “According to the government, ‘The commission will raise the level of debate regarding the importance of beauty in the built environment’.

“What it didn’t say is that alongside this they intend to get as many new homes built as possible without imposing any constraints on how they look, how they work or whether communities want them.”

As the country struggles to build the homes it needs, there’s certainly an argument that such concerns as size and character may be sacrificed for the goal of getting more units to market, without a focus on quality as well as quantity. But then existing properties could need more work and may well have higher energy bills.

Whether it’s a newbuild or an existing property, there’s an awful lot to keep the buyer on their toes.

BREXIT: WHAT THE LATEST FURORE MEANS FOR YOUR MONEY

It has been a riotous 24 hours in the corridors of power with deals done, resignations tendered and more than a few pointed pieces to camera by wannabe leaders.

By now the rest of us have realised something that the population of the House of Commons seems still unwilling to grasp – that this isn’t actually a game.

There are consequences not just for our individual financial affairs next March, but right now.

As the headlines erupted, markets stuttered, exchange rates choked and independent experts across the country sat back and took stock.

Here’s what they think all this means for your money.

Market reaction

The stock exchange was closed when the prime minister announced the Brexit agreement last night, but by Thursday morning, the biggest impact was clearly on UK focused housebuilders, banks and retailers, with vocal opposition to the deal and ministerial resignations putting downward pressure on these share prices.

“The market has taken a big red pen to stocks which are heavily exposed to the UK economy like the banks, retailers and housebuilders. These sectors were already under pressure, but the potential for an orderly Brexit to unravel in the next few days is causing further distress to be manifested in share prices,” says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst for Hargreaves Lansdown.

The pound held around $1.30 until early on Thursday morning, though ministerial resignations had pushed it down to below $1.28 at the time of writing, prompting governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney to summon the UK’s biggest banks to a call to discuss market turmoil.

But because so many of the biggest firms registered in the UK are heavily invested overseas, the drop is actually helping to keep these international organisations buoyant. That’s because they are making money in dollars, euros and yuan, which are now worth more in sterling terms.

“However if sustained, a weaker pound spells bad news for a retail sector which is already struggling, as it hikes up the price of imported goods and at the same time squeezes consumer incomes,” Khalaf warns.

“We can expect continued volatility in financial markets while political uncertainty swirls around Westminster. However it’s best to keep investment decisions detached from politics, as the EU referendum amply demonstrated. In febrile market conditions investors will be well served by avoiding kneejerk reactions and focusing on the long-term prospects for their portfolio.”

Knock-on effects

“Another interesting issue is how the Bank of England will react. Perhaps it will now take a cautious stance, meaning that the interest rate rises we were expecting will have disappeared, and this will do nothing for helping bank’s net interest margins,” says Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre.

“In my 20 years in the City, I have never seen such polarised movements on a single day between UK and non-UK focused stocks in the main index.

“Obviously, uncertainty has increased but this brings about the possibility of two polar outcomes, either a no-deal exit or the possibility of another referendum or general election.

“A no-deal Brexit is bad enough but a general election and the possibility of Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister could be a worst-case scenario for many businesses.

“This leaves UK investors in a conundrum; the stock market still offers attractive long-term returns but they will now need to focus even more so on what underlying exposures they have. Since the referendum, the international giants have fared rather well and we take the view that this will probably continue.

“Even if the global economy is slowing, there is growth nonetheless, and overseas earnings will be much more valuable as the sterling falls.”

What now?

“The message for investors is to leave any strong convictions at the door,” warns Will Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Smart Investor.

“The crucial point remains that the UK formally agreed to the draft withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU. However, the politics is complicated to say the least.

“Our hunch remains that the potentially dark unknowns of a hard Brexit will incentivise compromise of one sort or another. If such a compromise is not found, we should be prepared for both the UK economy and its related assets to be subjected to a more hair-raising time for a while.

“Nonetheless, the intrinsic value of the stocks quoted on the UK’s exchanges tends to have little to do with the UK economy.”

But that’s not all

The other issue, especially those trying to plan their retirements for example, is the yawning political vacuum left whenever a minister exits the building.

“Esther McVey’s departure after just 10 months in her position is unsettling, particularly since she evidences the lack of faith in Theresa May’s leadership. Who will replace her and how long they will last is anyone’s guess, particularly given the growing risk of a no-confidence vote,” says Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at Quilter.

“Leadership at the DWP has been about as stable as a mobile home in a hurricane as a parade of ministers have picked up the baton only to fling it away. Setting retirement policy and ensuring we have a well-functioning state pension system is a long-term project which is put at risk if the minister responsible for the DWP changes from one year to the next.

“Those planning ahead for their retirement need certainty and stability when it comes to government policy so that they can make informed financial planning choices,” Greer adds. “There are some big ticket issues that cannot be ignored for much longer, such as the future of the state-pension, gaps in auto-enrolment and the pension dashboard among many others.

“However, it seems all this will continue to be on the back burner as Brexit sits centre stage at Westminster.”

GENDER NEUTRAL STATE PENSION STARTS IN UK

From this week, and for the first time in 70 years, men and women will receive their state pension at the same age.

At first glance it seems like a sensible, positive move to put everyone on an even footing.

Beginning on 6 November, men and women will receive their pension from 65 for those reaching that age between now and 5 December. From then on, the state pension age – for everyone – increases to age 66 and then age 67.

But there’s a problem. Actually there are a few. And they’re big problems.

First is the fact that in the 25 years between plans for pension equalisation being announced and being realised, precious little communication was afforded to those whose retirement date would drift, with potentially huge knock-on implications for their finances.

Campaigners, including the vocal and determined Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) group have even sought compensation for failures to adequately inform women about decisions made by successive governments over when and how to balance the retirement age.

In a bid to save money, a rapid acceleration to the female state pension age caught out huge groups of women, particularly those born in 1953. Depending only on when you were born in that single year, the age you received your state pension as a woman could vary by as much as a year and nine months.

It meant a difference of thousands of pounds and, for those who weren’t expecting a shortfall, placed some women in severe financial straits.

But don’t make the mistake of wondering if this is just a small group of people complaining that they don’t get to put their feet up as early as their friends.

The historical gender difference in state pension age had gone some small way to alleviate the other, much bigger, issue around women’s pensions that isn’t going away any time soon.

Europe-wide, pensions consultancy Mercer calculates that the gender pay gap is about 16 per cent, but its knock-on effect on women’s retirement savings means the pensions gender gap is 40 per cent.

As Sarah Pennells, founder of women’s finance website SavvyWoman.co.uk, puts it: “Even if women had been given the full 15 years’ notice of a rise in their state pension age, it would have only helped those who could afford to save extra to make up the difference. And many of these women couldn’t.”

Maike Currie, investment director at Fidelity International, warns: “The pension system is relatively equal if people follow the same working pattern from age 20 to retirement, but they don’t.

“Women are more likely to have fragmented careers, be self-employed or work flexibly during their working life as they continue to bear the brunt of the childcare or take a career break to care for sick or elderly relatives.

“Of course, these factors are increasingly affecting men too, however, the average women’s pension pot is already much lower than the average man’s so women need to have the ability to catch up. As the Cridland report pointed out, in the first year of retirement women are expected to have 25 per cent less income than their male counterparts.”

Few would argue that eliminating gender discrimination, including by equalising the state pension, is anything but positive. But the change will undoubtedly make the gender pension gap worse.

By the time women reach the age of 50 they have an average of just half the private pension savings that men do – about £56,000 compared with £112,000, according to research from Aegon.

To catch up, a 50-year-old women would have to pay in an extra £360 every month until retirement.

Even at age 30, women need to contribute an extra £21 a month to close the gap on men. It’s little surprise that half of all women aren’t sure they will be able to retire comfortably, compared with only a third of men.

By coincidence, all this is happening in the same week as equal pay day. Saturday marks the hypothetical day in the year when women stop earning in like-for-like comparison with men’s salaries, according to the Fawcett Society.

“While limited progress is being made to close the gender pay gap, other factors impacting women’s ability to save adequately for retirement including career breaks to raise a family or to care for elderly parents, aren’t going anywhere,” says Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon.

“The equalisation of state pension age, and future planned increases are a further prompt to women to think about how much they’ll need to save privately for a comfortable retirement.”

Currie adds: “As women, we might not always have much control over things like the gender pay gap or equal pay day, and we can’t always control whether we could get that elusive pay rise or promotion. But we do have control over our personal finances.

“Make sure your savings are working hard enough by taking the appropriate level of risk. And whatever you do, save into a pension. Our research found that if a woman contributed an extra 1 per cent of her salary to her pension than she could close the gender pension gap by retirement.

“It’s worth remembering that tax rules dictate a limit to how much you can put into a pension each year. While ‘carry forward’ rules mean you can take forward any unused pension allowances from previous years, you can only contribute as much as you’ve earned in a given year up to a maximum of £40,000.

“So while you’re in work and earning, it’s important to put as much of any spare cash you have into your pension to ensure you don’t spend your golden years in poverty.”

THE OPEN BANKING REVOLUTION THAT NEVER WAS

At the start of 2018 open banking launched in the UK.

A secure way to give financial providers permission to access your financial information, enthusiasts predicted consumers would finally be able to use their own data to their own financial benefit while worriers wrung their hands over what it would mean for data safety including our much-targeted personal information.

Few would have said that by the end of the year the whole thing would have somehow sunk from view.

In fact, fewer than one in four of us has even heard of open banking. A new report from Splendid Unlimited, a company that helps retailers and banks design and build new digital platforms, suggests that just 9 per cent of people have used open banking services and four out of five don’t know what it means or entails. Brave new world this isn’t.

“Overall, open banking providers are failing to address the lack of trust, privacy and security concerns, and ignorance of the benefits of using their products,” warns Paul Bishop, founder of Splendid Unlimited.

“These findings highlight a number of key challenges open banking service providers must now address and offer key lessons for the effective and successful rollout of other new technology-driven service innovations – notably, the further and more widespread introduction of blockchain technology – both in the financial services sector, and beyond.”

But that doesn’t mean you can’t gain advantage from open banking and, predictably, a range of fintech firms are offering open banking-enabled products.

Here are a handful of the current options, but as awareness and demand grow there are likely to be more. Perhaps this particular revolution is more of a slow burn.

Yolt

Its name may sound more like a probiotic yoghurt but this app is actually very smart. It syncs all your accounts and credit cards so that you can see them all in one place, combining the data in order to provide clear information on spending, as well as upcoming debits.

That data analysis allows you to see a “smart balance”, which is how much cash you have left to spend after bills have come out. Users can set goals and budgets and track their progress.

After launching in June last year, it now has half a million registered users, mostly in the UK. The app is free to use but it will offer financial deals and products it considers suitable and earn a commission if you sign up.

Chip

When a customer gives Chip access to their current account it uses an algorithm to analyse their spending and work out how much they can afford to save each month. Then it siphons that cash away into a savings pot.

A small amount of cash is transferred out every few days, the idea being that this is easier for most people to budget around. It’s saved into a Barclays instant access account and you can earn up to 5 per cent on that cash by inviting friends to sign up. Until you do so it pays 0 per cent.

It also has a “chirpy” chatbot interface that lets you know when it’s taken money and how much.

Connected Money

This app allows customers to see all their accounts in one place, assess where their money goes and see how much cash they will have to spend once their bills have gone out.

It’s powered by HSBC but can access data from 21 different banks, including savings, current accounts, mortgages, loans and credit cards.

To access this app, however, you do need an HSBC current account.

Bean

Another whimsically named app, Bean bills itself as “the future” of bill payments and allows you to compare deals on all household bills, cancel unwanted subscriptions and track payments across every account using a simple dashboard.

It’s like a bill management system and comparison website mashed together.

Bean can also cancel direct debits, allowing customers to stay on top of their recurring payments. As with other options it’s free and the company earns a fee if you use it to switch any services.

Plum

Using an artificial intelligence and communicating via a Facebook chatbot, Plum enables customers to save money out of their current accounts and begin investing it.

It connects to your current account or accounts and monitors spending patterns, setting aside an amount of money every few days that it has worked out is affordable for each user. Depending on the income of the account holder it typically saves between £25 and £200 a month.

Then there are investment options available if they want to move that money out of savings. On top of that it also helps customers compare and switch their bills to better deals.

MoneyBox

Several open banking apps promise to use clever algorithms to whip away affordable amounts of money every few days and save them. This app does something slightly different.

With MoneyBox, users invest their spare change by rounding up the cost of payments. So, when a customer pays £2.40 for a coffee, it rounds it up to £3 and invests the extra 60p into a pre-agreed investment account.

Customers have clarity about how much is being taken from their accounts and invested, because it consistently rounds up the small everyday payments we all make. The founders hope it will help make investing possible for people who have very little spare cash, through a series of micro-payments.

MILLENNIALS FAIL GCSE FINANCIAL SKILLS TEST ACED BY BABY BOOMERS AND 16-YEAR-OLDS

Four years after the introduction of financial education in English secondary schools, 16-year-old leavers today have better money management skills than most adults.

That’s according to results from an experiment designed to test the effects of compulsory money lessons on the country’s youngest earners and highlight the potential issues for those left behind.

As part of the investigation, 1,000 people of all ages took a mock GCSE financial literacy exam based on guidance from the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Financial Education for Young People.

More than two in five of the 16-year-olds who sat the exam achieved an A grade, suggesting that financial education in schools is indeed having a positive effect.

Nicholas Amoui, 16, from Portsmouth, said he did a financial education course at school and really enjoyed it.

“I’ve always liked maths, so when it was applied to real-life situations it made a lot of sense,” he said.

“I recently went to the US, and the financial skills I had learned came in useful when I needed to exchange currency. There are a lot of deals around and sometimes it can be difficult to tell which one really is the best.

“Having that financial knowledge gave me a lot of confidence.”

It’s a boost that could benefit more than just those teenagers too. Several international studies examining strategies for relieving poverty over recent years have demonstrated that providing financial education to a school-aged child regularly improves the whole household’s money skills.

Meanwhile, fresh from the school of life, baby boomers also performed well. In fact, they aced the test, according to data from free credit report provider Noddle, which conducted the experiment.

Almost 60 per cent of 50- to 65-year-olds achieved an A or above, the consumer group that finds financial decision-making the least daunting of any age group.

The mock paper used in the research looked to gauge people’s understanding of key financial principles, as well as test their grasp of basic maths in the context of typical money scenarios.

Questions included calculating the best interest rates, analysing the impact of inflation, understanding the difference between good and bad debt and picking the right multi-buy deal in a supermarket.

In other words, this wasn’t a paper testing whether we can calculate compound interest or correctly interpret a fund fact sheet. It was a paper assessing the very basics of financial knowledge and applications that we come up against every day – knowledge that could mean a fortune lost or gained over a lifetime.

And yet millennials got just half the questions right on average. If it had been a real exam, a third would have failed. A quarter would have got the very lowest grade possible – an E – or below compared with less than a fifth of 16-year-olds.

Almost two thirds of the 19- to 39-year-olds assessed couldn’t correctly answer a question on what a credit score was. This is despite 46 per cent saying that their education taught them about credit scores.

“At secondary school, I didn’t get any financial education,” said Thomas James, a 30-year-old from London. “I think the mentality back then was this was something you learn about once you leave school. I’m glad to hear that the government has changed this, and financial education is now on the curriculum.

“My lack of financial understanding has caused me problems. I’m not great at budgeting and putting money away for a rainy day. These days I do a lot of reading online to try to better myself in personal finance. I’m looking to buy a house in the next year, so I want to be in a position where I know I’m making the best financial decision.”

In fact, more than half of millennials say they find it hard to make financial decisions.

Already facing costs and debt levels that far exceed their predecessors, it’s clear millennials are trying to pursue their financial aspirations with one hand tied behind their backs.

Separate research out this week shows three quarters of millennials are actively putting money into savings, for example, and that, as a generation, they save the highest proportion of their income of any adults.

But while many millennials save hard, the cost of assets – especially property – means that no matter how hard they save many won’t be able to establish the lives they want without assistance. Some have given up on saving – one in 20 18- to 34-year-olds feel that major life goals, such as home ownership, seem so unachievable that it has discouraged them from saving. More than one in 10 also feel uninformed about the amount of money they should be putting away.

“Once young people leave school or university and enter the working world, it’s important that they feel inspired and empowered by earning their own money for the first time," says Liz Alley, divisional director, financial planning, for Brewin Dolphin.

"For many, it’s a time of life when they start thinking about their longer-term goals and this can feel quite overwhelming. Money will be an important part of achieving these goals, and so thinking of the two together is important.

"To make this a less daunting prospect, young adults can think about breaking this down into different areas, creating separate savings pots for different goals to make it more manageable.”

UNDER-45S EXPECT £1.2 TRILLION IN INHERITANCE, BUT PARENTS DON’T TRUST THEM WITH IT

We may not be comfortable admitting it – to ourselves or others – but millions of us are banking on being left or given a chunk of cash to get by long-term.

More than 11 million 25-45 year olds – around two-thirds of the entire generation expect to receive inheritance from parents or grandparents. Of these, almost half believe they’re on course to receive £50,000.

In fact, today’s youngest adults anticipate an average of £233,000 each over the next 30 years, according to research from investment firm Sanlam.

Inheritance, or generational wealth transfer has always played a part in our long-term money management, but the handover currently under way is from the wealthiest generation in modern Britain to some of the most stretched.

But the latest data from the Office for National Statistics out this week shows the distribution of this transfer is far from consistent.

Individuals with the most income and wealth to start with are most likely to receive the largest gifts and loans.

The least wealthy and youngest individuals receive smaller inheritances, on average, but those transfers make up a much larger proportion of their total wealth.

The money received by people in the poorest fifth of the population typically makes up 44 per cent of their total wealth.

It’s clear this kind of windfall has the potential to change the recipient’s life – one that alters the way we deal with our financial affairs long before we receive the money.

Around a third of those expecting a substantial inheritance admit to putting off saving and “living in the now” because they have the windfall coming, the Sanlam figures suggest.

A similar number say they will be reliant on their inheritance for their future financial security. And yet huge swathes of them haven’t ever had a conversation about the money from the people they expect to receive the money from.

“Given that 25-45 year olds are expecting to receive more than £1.2 trillion in the next 30 years, conversations around the intergenerational transfer of wealth are becoming increasingly necessary,” says Carl Drummond, senior wealth planner at Sanlam UK.

“While it’s often not an easy conversation to have, it’s an important one. Many younger people are relying on inheritances to pay off debts or avoid saving for later life and if their expectations exceed the windfall they receive, they are at risk of making unrealistic long-term financial decisions.

Meanwhile, nearly half of those planning to leave an inheritance to the younger generation are concerned about how they will use the money.

Nor is this just about the discomfort of addressing the nation’s two most taboo subjects – money and death – as they coming crashing together.

“The average age at which people get assistance from their older loved ones is getting later and later as government policy encourages people to pass on wealth on death,” says Rachael Griffin, tax and financial planning specialist at Quilter.

“The age that people can expect to inherit is now edging into their mid-sixties, while those aged 25 to 34 are most likely to get gifts or loans from family, consistent with the rise of the bank of mum and dad as one of the prime lenders for first-time buyers.

In 2018 people are living longer and retired households are at historic highs in terms of the wealth they hold relative to the working-age population. One way to ease the pressure on the younger generations is to allow wealth to filter down more easily. There’s also a small matter of inheritance tax, which could wipe up to 40 per cent off the amount being passed down without careful planning.

All of this means it’s high time for an honest intergenerational discussion. But where to start?

5 tips for good inheritance chat

Before you have a family discussion about inheritance, you need to have a good idea of your financial position and your intentions:

1. Who do you want to receive your wealth?

It sounds simple enough, but our study, The Generation Games, has shown that potential beneficiaries don’t always realise they will be sharing their inheritance with others, such as grandchildren, charities or friends. While this may result in a difficult conversation, at least you will be helping your beneficiaries be more realistic about their financial future.

2. Establish how much you are likely to pass down

This is quite complex, and it’s worth seeking advice from a financial planner. Firstly, you should write down the total value of your assets, where they are held and how they are invested. (As an aside, it may be worth considering consolidating accounts to minimise paperwork and administration for you.) Then you need to calculate how much you think you will need for the future. Obviously, this is hard to predict as you don’t know how long you will live and how healthy you will be, but it’s good to make some predictions. Lastly, you need to consider how you would fund possible care expenses if the need arises.

3. Gift now or leave for later?

Once you have been through this exercise, you should have a better idea of how much money you have, how much you will need, and how much you could potentially gift now.

4. State your wishes

Do you want to have a say on how the assets are spent or used? Are you happy to provide an outright gift with no conditions attached? State your intentions now so that your beneficiaries know what to expect.

5. Plan to minimise inheritance tax (IHT)

With the help of a financial adviser, work out your IHT position (in total) and on each asset (individually) you have. Once you have this information, you can start considering how you can reduce your inheritance tax by reviewing all the different allowances and options available. You should also fund your expenses from assets that are subject to IHT, as this will help reduce your taxable estate.

HOW TO TRICK YOUR BRAIN INTO PAIN-FREE SAVINGS

We’re not saving enough in the UK. Savings in relation to household disposable income are at the lowest levels since 1963, while 16.8 million people have under £100 in emergency money.

People who want to lose weight can try crash diets that rarely work for long or they can change their lifestyle and mindset to improve their nutrition on a day-by-day and meal-by-meal basis.

It’s the same with savings. If you want to build a buffer then extreme money-saving plans risk putting you off.

But small, regular, pain-free top-ups to your savings account build over time into something valuable and, more importantly, sustainable. Just because it doesn’t hurt doesn’t mean it’s not working.
