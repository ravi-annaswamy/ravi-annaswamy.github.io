So, here are a few ways to save that could be pain free.

Save your tax cut

In his latest Budget speech, the chancellor announced that from April next year, 12 months sooner than planned, the personal income tax allowance will rise from £11,850 to £12,500. At the same time, the threshold at which people will begin to pay the higher rate will rise from £46,350 to £50,000.

Everyone’s tax affairs are slightly different but this should mean that people who pay basic rate tax will see an extra £130 stay in their pocket each year while those earning above £50,000 could gain an extra £730 on top of that too.

Yorkshire Building Society has suggested savers take that extra cash and put it into savings rather than absorbing it into their spending.

Tanya Jackson, head of corporate affairs at the society, says she urges workers who can afford to, to save their tax breaks. “A basic-rate taxpayer who had deposited the money they’d saved from changes to the personal allowance since 2010 would now have an extra £5,434 in their savings account.”

Of course, it’s important to mention that if you’re struggling to balance your current budget and you find yourself getting into debt simply through the cost of living, then saving any tax break you get doesn’t make sense.

Everyone needs some emergency cash in the bank but after that, if you’re in debt then it makes sense to pay that down before building savings up.

Take the easy wins

It’s not just tax breaks; if you suddenly increase your income – maybe through a pay rise at work or because you’ve finally cleared a debt – then it’s worth trying to simply save that extra money.

You’re not used to having it anyway so there shouldn’t be any pain involved in giving it up.

Turn to tech

One of the best ways to save money without any pain is to squirrel away regular, small but affordable amounts.

The trouble is that thinking and planning that much is not exactly pain free and it’s easy to forget. But fintech firms understand that and it’s possible to make use of a digital savings assistant app that will assess your spending, work out how much money would be affordable for you to put into savings and move the cash into a savings account.

You don’t need to do anything but these apps tend to send notifications when they move the money, so you can see your savings build without feeling the pain of transferring larger sums each month.

Apps that offer this service include Plum and Chip; they have slightly different offerings so it’s worth taking time to review which will work best for you.

Try a savings challenge

When so many people don’t have even £100 in savings, any extra will help. One way to trick yourself into saving more is to gamify making savings. Challenges work when it comes to getting fit, they might also help you get your savings into shape.

There are a few different savings games, some more affordable than others. There’s the 52-week challenge, where you save £1 in the first week, £2 in the second, £3 in the third and so on.

Stick with that and by week 52 you’re saving a potentially painful £52 but you’ve also saved almost £1,400 in a year.

Another savings game spreads the amount more evenly across the year. It’s generally known as the 365 savings challenge and requires you to save £1 on Monday, £2 on Tuesday and so on, right up to £7 on the Sunday.

That is £28 a week or £112 a month, so it’s not affordable for everyone. The money saving commentator Skint Dad suggests a more affordable option would be to save simply a penny more each day; 1p on the first day, 2p on the second and so on throughout the year until you’re saving £3.65 on the last day at the end of the year.

Hit that target and you’ll have £667.95 saved.

Spend less without cutting your lifestyle

One of the best ways to save money without feeling any pain or pinch is to cut back your bills so that you spend less on the same level of lifestyle.

That means comparing and switching household bills, it means finding a cheaper supermarket, it means looking for a better deal on the products and services you use.

By making sure you skim off the money you save and put it into savings, you can save money without noticing a difference.

Find a new income stream

If you can find a new source of income and siphon off all that extra money into your savings account then you can watch your emergency fund grow without noticing any difference.

You could even ensure that extra income is paid straight into a savings account so that there’s never any temptation to keep it and spend it – that really would be pain free.

Adding a new income stream doesn’t mean you need to take on an evening job necessarily. That would be far from pain free! But you might be able to rent a room to a lodger: under the Rent A Room scheme you can let out a furnished bedroom and earn up to £7,500 a year tax-free.

Yes there are costs associated with a lodger but many people can earn significant sums by agreeing to share their home.

If that doesn’t appeal or if you can’t do it then there are other ways to make extra cash; you could rent out loft space as storage or even your drive. Look for ways to earn more but be regimented about setting it aside – it’s all too easy to incorporate it into your daily spending.

BUDGET 2018: THE DEVIL IN THE DETAIL

The hammed-up circus that is the chancellor of the exchequer’s Budget statement is full of dreadful jokes, political point scoring and a field full of rabbits from hats.

It bigs up the giveaways, breaks and pro-active actions that the government wants us to focus on.

But released alongside this frustrating and socially awkward one-man show, the tome that is the Budget document itself (and its reams of supporting paperwork) is obliged to include the details, decisions and unpalatable fiscal swerving that the government is desperate to sweep under the nearest threadbare carpet.

Here are the bits of this week’s Budget that Hammond et al didn’t really want to admit to.

Giving and taking away – income tax

The big news in Hammond’s much anticipated speech was the increase in the income tax thresholds for lower rate and higher rate taxpayers from April 2019.

In fact, the chancellor has been far less generous to millions of higher earners than appeared at first sight, according to detailed study of Budget papers by mutual insurer Royal London.

In his speech, Hammond announced that the starting point for higher rate income tax would increase from £46,350 to £50,000. This will reduce the income tax rate on the slice of pay between £46,350 to £50,000 from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.

But a detailed paper published alongside the Budget says the upper earnings limit for national insurance contributions will be increased in line with the rise in the increase in the floor for higher rate tax.

This means that instead of paying an NIC rate of 2 per cent, workers will pay the full rate of 12 per cent on this same slice of earnings, an increase of 10 per cent.

So the 20 per cent income tax cut is tempered by a 10 per cent increase in the NIC rate by 10 per cent.

“The chancellor is well within his rights to increase the bands over which the full rate of NI contributions is payable,” says Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London.

“But as this wipes out half of the income tax gain for higher earners, he should have come clean and mentioned this in the Budget speech rather than leave it in the Budget small print.”

Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, warns: “Scottish residents face a worse situation.

“The Scottish government sets its own threshold for higher rate tax, which is currently £43,000. We will need to wait until the Scottish Budget on 12 December to see if they will unfreeze this. But the changes to national insurance apply across the UK. This means someone in Scotland earning £50,000 will pay an extra £30.41 in NI without saving anything in income tax.”

Freedom to tax – taking £400m more from pensions

The pensions industry heaved a sigh of relief that retirement savings had seemingly dodged a tax raid this week after years of fundamental and confusing upheaval.

But one document – published alongside the Budget - reveals a significant upgrade in the estimate pension freedoms tax take for this tax year.

Coming to light on page 113 of The Office for Budget Responsibility’s fiscal outlook is the revelation that the Treasury will net an extra £400million in tax as a result of people paying tax on their retirement withdrawals.

Based on the Spring Budget 2017 costings – which factored in a tax take of £900million in 2018/19 – this suggests a near 50 per cent increase in revenue raised from the policy this year to £1.3billion, taking the total tax generated by the policy to £5.5billion.

“The OBR says this is because older retirees ‘are drawing down their pensions for longer’,” says Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell.

“This could be explained by the fact buoyant stock markets have allowed savers to take income from their pensions for longer than expected. Alternatively, the OBR’s initial guess may simply have been wrong.

“Either way, there is no doubt the policy has been hugely successful from the Treasury’s perspective, both in boosting the attractiveness of pensions and raising additional tax revenue.”

Foreigners forfeit – penalising property buyers

Then there’s the next latest tinkering in a desperate bid to grab the reins of an unruly property market.

“Buried within the ‘Red Book’, the Chancellor has pledged to publish a consultation in January 2019 on a Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) surcharge of 1 per cent for non-residents buying residential property in England and Northern Ireland,” notices

Ashley Osborne, head of residential at real estate business Colliers International.

“Introducing a 1 per cent surcharge for overseas buyers will only put further pressure on housing supply, as foreign demand enables many developers to build more homes.

“The government continues to push the false belief that foreigners are buying up homes in the capital in droves and leaving them empty, despite the fact there is almost no evidence to suggest this is the case. The sub £600,000 price bracket – already popular with domestic investors and Help to Buy purchasers – will become even more overburdened by an increase of foreign buyers looking for lower priced properties in order to reduce their exposure to higher levels of SDLT.”

Charlie Wells, managing director of buying agency Prime Purchase, adds: “On the one hand, the government claims to champion social mobility and diversity but on the other, it is saying that if you are foreign you are not welcome. There is no logic to it.

“If this government thinks that penalising the people at the top, particularly foreigners, will revitalise the economy and get things going, then it is very wrong."

Moving on – the divorce disaster

The Budget contained two key proposals to the way we’re taxed when selling our main residence.

The first, which he set out in his speech is to effectively abolish the £40,000 ‘lettings relief’, which applies if you let out your property. It can be worth as much as £11,200 in Capital Gains tax (CGT).

But the second, which wasn’t mentioned so clearly, is the proposal to half the amount of time you have to sell your main home after you move before you are hit with CGT.

If the proposal is adopted, you will have to sell your main home within 9 months after moving out – a potentially huge and expensive problem for divorcing couples, for example, or accidental landlords.

But believe it or not there were also some details, omissions and confirmations in this year’s Budget that could also make a huge and positive difference to our money.

What’s on your dashboard?

The pensions dashboard is a huge piece of work currently being undertaken by the pensions industry and government to provide Brits with a single point to review pensions savings that are often all over the place and forgotten.

In response to widespread confusion over how much we need to save for retirement, the plan is that a consumer can log into their personalised pensions dashboard and check the details, values, charges and other aspects of every pension pot they have to give them a clear idea of how much their total savings are worth – including their state pension.

“Although the Government’s commitment to the dashboard appeared to waiver earlier this year, the announcement of £5m to consult on the design of the dashboard is a positive step, and confirms Westminster’s commitment to it,” says Alistair Wilson, Zurich’s head of retail platform strategy.

“With the Government seemingly firmly behind the dashboard and state pension information also likely to be included on it, this should increase the pressure on providers who have so far been reluctant to sign-up to it.”

Social care clarity, or lack of it

One of the greatest demands on our personal and national funds for the future will be the cost of an ageing population.

The current funding gap is so concerning, and so many individuals have faced such problems and financial hardship arranging the care they or their loved ones need, that it has become hugely political – an issue that could sway general elections.

So it’s a relief, but not a surprise that this week’s Budget included measures to help curb the crisis, or at least pay it lip service.

“The Chancellor’s announcement of an additional £650 million to help English councils meet social care costs will be welcome,” says Tom McPhail, head of policy at Hargreaves Lansdown.

“However it’s disappointing the government still hasn’t published its paper setting out plans for a coherent long-term strategy to address the financial and social challenges of caring for an ageing population.

“The government urgently needs to set out its policy on how much individuals should have to pay themselves, and under what circumstances. The last Conservative manifesto flirted with a comprehensive care policy, before retreating in disarray. The sooner they address this pressing issue, the better.’

Other long-term problems playing out in the personal finance have also been acknowledged.

In this week’s Budget the government has finally confirmed it will bring forward regulations to ban cold calling around pensions - welcome news in the fight against fraudsters.

And the DWP will publish a paper this winter setting out the government’s ideas on boosting pensions savings among the millions of self-employed workers left out in the cold by the workplace pension.

All in all, the ramifications of this week’s Budget should keep us going until the spring, when, Phil suggests, we could see a Budget event resurrected as Brexit kicks in. Which could be even more fun.

BUDGET 2018 TAX TABLES: WHAT THE GOVERNMENT’S CHANGES MEAN FOR YOU

The winners in this Budget are readily identifiable. First: middle and high earners. Those earning less than £100,000 will benefit from a higher personal allowance of £12,500 and increased basic rate tax band of £37,500 – and so will not pay 40% tax until earnings reach £50,000. An individual basic rate taxpayer will be £130 better off as a result of the higher personal allowance.

Entrepreneurs will also gain. Despite calls from some quarters to abolish the £10m entrepreneurs’ relief allowance, the chancellor decided to revise the provision to increase the minimum holding period from one year to two years. The increased timeframe is unlikely to affect many, as most entrepreneurs recognise that it takes more than two years to establish a successful business that they will sell.

Businesses generally could gain. There was speculation that the proposed corporation tax cut to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020 could be scrapped – but this has remained. In addition, businesses will benefit from a temporary increased “Annual Investment Allowance” of £1m (from the current £200,000), which provides a full deduction on capital expenditure.

As for losers, let’s take top earners. When someone earns more than £100,000 of income, they start to lose their personal allowance by £1 for every £2 of income they earn over this threshold. This creates an effective rate of tax of 60 per cent. The increase in the personal allowance means the 60 per cent effective rate of tax remains in effect for longer than before – between £100,000 and £125,000. However, because the chancellor, unexpectedly, left tax relief on pensions contributions alone, someone in this position could make a substantial contribution to their pension pot to bring themselves back under the £100,000 mark (if they have the scope to do so under the pension relief rules).

Then there are homeowners. The chancellor has proposed two new changes to main residence relief, when selling your home. The main proposed change is to shorten the current 18-month exemption to nine months, meaning a shorter period for people to move house and not be subject to capital gains tax. The second proposed change effectively relates to abolishing the £40,000 “lettings relief”, which applies when someone lets out their home. “Lettings relief” can be worth up to £11,200 in Capital Gains Tax.

Last, in contrast to beer, sprits and cider drinkers – wine connoisseurs. While duty rates on beer and spirits will be frozen, the duty on wine will increase in line with inflation. Those who enjoy a glass of their favourite red should do so before 1 February 2019, when the higher duty applies (but they should drink responsibly of course).

BUDGET 2018: WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOUR WALLET

It could so easily have been another damp Budgetary squib for us mere mortals.

As Chancellor Philip Hammond promised an extra £20bn for the NHS with one hand and had to batten down the economic hatches as we ride into a still unknown Brexit with the other, there was a chance today’s announcement would have few big headlines that would make any difference at all for most of us.

And for the majority of his big speech in the House of Commons, or rather the Office of Ways and Means, this afternoon, it was just that – plenty of broad economic predictions, complex business chat and jokes that fell absolutely flat. Just like any other Budget speech in recent history.

And then he started pulling out the Budget Bunnies – the rabbits from hats that he claimed had largely escaped early. While we had certainly heard about a few in advance he still managed to keep plenty under wraps.

Far from the usual dull Budget speech, this one may have been the longest in a decade, but it was full of surprises.

So what were they? And how will they affect you? Here’s our Budget Briefing for your wallet.

By far the biggest headline will be reserved for the new Income Tax threshold of £12,500 a year for basic rate tax payers and £50,000 a year for higher rate payers from next April.

There had been rumours of bringing this giveaway forward, but with such a big financial gap to fill for the health service, few took it seriously. In fact with ministers indicating that the NHS hole would have to be filled in part by a tax increase, there were real fears for the nation’s workers.

Instead, if their salaries remain the same in April, basic rate tax payers – approximately 32 million people - will see their take home pay rise by around £132 a year.

Crucially, the allowance will then rise in line with the rate of inflation.

Minimum wage

Income tax isn’t necessarily the biggest win though, especially for those earning the least.

A minimum wage increase to £8.21 for adults over the age of 25 equates to around £690 extra pounds a year on average, though that is of course subject to income tax – see above.

Benefits

The PR car crash that has been the Universal Credit roll out got a desperate cash injection of £1bn from Philip Hammond today, which may or may not assist the millions of people struggling to navigate the complex application system and facing dire financial straits while doing so.

But with horrifying numbers of families with at least one working parent struggling on the breadline, the increase of £1000 in the amount you can earn before your benefits begin to be removed could be a lifeline. The Chancellor claims 24 million working families with children will gain £630 a year from this measure alone.

Property

Then there are the policies whose effects may not be so obvious.

The £5.5bn cash injection into the Housing Infrastructure Fund will, Hammond claims, equate to 650,000 extra houses to help ease the housing crisis.

Whether it will depends on where those properties will be built, if planning policy will allow them to be erected in the right areas and, crucially, what time period we’re talking about here.

Given that the UK requires 250,000 extra houses every year to start to ease the supply and demand bubble, it will need to be fast.

Elsewhere, news that 500 neighbourhood planning systems will help local people buy property at a discounted rate to prevent them being priced out of the area they grew up in could work. Or it could make things worse if restrictions on selling those properties on aren’t in place.

“There was also some welcome news for first-time buyers in today’s Budget,” says Daniel Hegarty of digital mortgage broker Habito.

“The Chancellor announced that stamp duty relief will be extended to those who purchase properties up to a value of £500,000 through the shared ownership scheme – which will no doubt be received positively.

“This policy will be backdated to the last budget so that anyone who has purchased a property through the scheme since 22 November 2017 will be entitled a refund.”

With few first time buyers falling into the £300,000 - £500,000, even in the nation’s biggest cities, the Office for Budget Responsibility believes the cost to HMRC will only be £5m in total – hardly transformative.

Debt

It wasn’t included in the typically raucous speech today, but we already know that the government is investigating the possibility of a no-interest loan to try to assist those with problem debt.

Against a backdrop of runaway personal debt levels around the country, StepChange Director of External Affairs Richard Lane said:

“Having campaigned for years for a no-interest loan scheme, we’re looking forward to working with the government and the banks to bring it to life. Over a million people turned to high cost credit last year to meet basic living expenses, which is counterproductive both for households and the economy. If finances are tight and your fridge breaks down, the last thing you need is expensive credit - what you need is simply a replacement fridge.

“By taking away the additional high cost of borrowing, the new scheme will demonstrate how no interest loans can act as a realistic and better alternative to short term high cost credit. It can only be a good thing to reduce the risk of households building up problem debt as a result of trying to meet their basic needs.”

Also in the extensive Budget document itself is reference to a new ‘breathing space scheme’.

Akin to a Scottish policy already in place, debt charities in other parts of the UK have been calling on the Government to give all individual debtors a period of time during which interest, charges and enforcement action is stopped while they seek regulated debt advice.

The Government is now considering increasing the gap from the six weeks originally proposed to a total of 60 days. Joanna Elson OBE, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said:

“The government’s planned Breathing Space scheme has the potential to be a game-changer for the fight against problem debt – but only if the scheme provides a genuine ‘breathing space’ covering all kinds of debts, including those owed to government. Anything less would be a missed opportunity.

“If Breathing Space protections apply for 60 days instead of six weeks that should be a positive step, and will give people in financial difficulty more time to start to resolve their debt problems. There will still be some people who will need longer to do this – and we will continue to argue for this period of protection to be extended at the discretion of an expert debt adviser.”

Conspicuously absent

There’s plenty to talk about but several fiscal targets have gone unplundered by the Chancellor yet again, despite real fears that Pensions tax relief in particular would be overhauled in a so-called cash ‘raid’.

It hasn’t happened. Yet.

Mr Hammond opened with the claim that this was a Budget for the strivers, grafters and carers, though his evidence for this remains limited, especially carers.

Nor was this Budget one for savers – long or short term. And while many in the pensions industry will be heaving a sigh of relief that seemingly endless upheaval and massive regulatory changes are being allowed an extended period of bedding in, the risk remains that confused consumers still trying to grapple with changes including early access to pension funds without punitive tax charges are sitting ducks for fraudsters.

Meanwhile, the Lifetime Allowance for pensions – the amount of money a saver can set aside over their entire working life before incurring extra tax charges - will rise by only £25,000 to £1.055m in 2019-20.

Tim Holmes, managing director of financial adviser Salisbury House Wealth, says:

“The increase in the Lifetime pension Allowance is only in line with inflation – it does not go far enough by a long stretch.”

“Many ‘ordinary’ public sector professionals such as GPs and teachers will be facing substantial tax charges as regular contributions from their salaries may exceed the limit, which is just far too low.”

“In previous years the Lifetime Allowance has been chopped back too aggressively, dropping from £1.8m in 2011-12 to a low of £1m in 2017-18, and has just started to recover. The damage done by this is only just beginning to show – with thousands being hit by the punitive tax charges.”

And while we shouldn't ignore the fact that we've been spared the introduction of yet another Individual Savings Account (ISA), the limits for 2019-20 will remain unchanged at £20,000. The annual subscription limit for Junior ISAs for 2019-20 will be uprated in line with the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation measure to £4,368.

“The ISA limit has remained the same, which further inhibits savers,” Holmes adds.

“The Government want to encourage people to save so that they don’t become a burden on the state – but they disincentivise the people who are able to afford to do this. This could make them a burden on the state in the future.”

BUDGET 2018: THE EXPERT WISH LIST

It’s the eve of the most important Budget in Philip Hammond’s career as chancellor of the exchequer.

And with the last major throw of the financial dice before Brexit, “Spreadsheet Phil” may be forgiven for taking advantage of the special dispensation he has to have a drink while delivering his plans for a post-EU UK.

So what measures are experts urging Hammond to adopt for the sake of the nation? And what shouldn’t he meddle with?

“Having our major fiscal event thrown in among a calendar of critical Brexit talks is far from ideal,” says Stella Amiss, head of tax policy at PwC.

“It’s no surprise that the chancellor seemingly wants things done and dusted as soon as possible. But the continued uncertainty means there is some difficult terrain to navigate if he wants to make any significant policy changes.

“After committing to just one major fiscal event it seems more likely the chancellor may have to break his pledge and earmark another Budget in the spring once we have a better idea of the fiscal landscape. That leaves the prospect of an autumn Budget that’s more likely to contain a couple of headline grabbers, with measures of real substance stored up until the spring,” she adds.

“As has been the case for recent Budgets, the unsettled political landscape in which the chancellor is operating leaves little room for manoeuvre. But having committed an extra £20bn a year in NHS funding, he now faces the conundrum of how to raise taxes in ways that won’t be too unpalatable to the electorate.”

Benefits

When it comes to tax and benefits, the biggest story in the last year has certainly been the almighty hash the switch to universal credit has become.

Claimants have been left destitute as their accounts have been streamlined from a series of different benefits to this single source of support, compounding the effects of cuts announced in the 2015 July Budget that meant 3.2 million households will be around £50 a week worse off on universal credit compared with tax credits – most of them families with children.

As new research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation reveals almost three million children are locked in poverty despite living in a working family, the charity has urged the government to put £2bn back into universal credit to boost the living standards of almost 10 million parents and children in working families.

“As Britain prepares for Brexit, we need to make sure working families have a firm foundation from which they can build a better life,” warns Campbell Robb, chief executive of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation who points to the work allowance – the amount working claimants can earn before their benefits are stopped. “Reforming universal credit by increasing the work allowances for families with children is one step that would help address the rising tide of in-work poverty.

“The work allowance is over five times more effective at getting money into the pockets of low-income working families than increasing the personal tax allowance,” he adds. “The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates it will cost £1.4 billion to raise the personal tax allowance (PTA) to £12,500 and the higher rate threshold to £50,000 in 2020. This money would be better spent helping to pay the lion’s share of increased work allowances.”

Personal finances

Coming into the Budget announcement with some broadly positive economic news at his back means the chancellor may take a slightly more relaxed approach to certain spending commitments, suggests Richard Stone, Chief Executive of The Share Centre.

“The economic outlook for personal investors has improved in recent times too, most notably with the return to positive real wage growth after years of negative real wages. This should increase consumer spending power, but should also enable individuals a little more headroom to save and invest.”

The Household Savings Ratio published by the Office for National Statistics – the proportion of our income that we set aside – has fallen to a level around 4 per cent, not seen for more than 50 years. “Indeed the rate is less than half that experienced over the last 50 years. This needs to recover and government needs to do more to encourage savings and investments,” Stone warns.

“We therefore call upon the chancellor to take action in three specific areas in his forthcoming budget: improve financial education by promoting a Financial Awareness GCSE using child trust funds; increase public participation in capital markets, and; continue to encourage savings and investments.”

Pensions

It is rumoured the UK Treasury has a small red box on the wall, with a glass lid inscribed “In case of Budget emergency, break glass”. Inside it keeps the UK’s pensions tax relief.

With spending promises for the NHS and elsewhere to be honoured, the tax reliefs handed out to pension savers are once again under scrutiny. Hammond has called out the pension system in his recent speech to the IMF conference in Bali, so he clearly has a tax raid in mind.

His targets for pension tax relief savings could include scrapping the higher rate tax relief or moving to a flat rate, reducing the tax-free lump sum allowance and reducing the annual allowance for all pension savers.

“There are plenty of ways the chancellor can raid our pensions to help balance his Budget,” warns Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown.

“His ideal formula would be something which is easy to implement, doesn’t upset many people, raises lots of money and doesn’t seriously erode the long term retirement savings system.”

“The change which would potentially raise the most revenue is something targeted at the underlying assets in the pension system, similar to Gordon Brown’s infamous advance corporation tax raid in 1997. There’s around £2.1 trillion in the pension system so even a very modest transaction charge of some description could raise serious revenue.”

“Unfortunately the mood music suggests the government is quite willing to carry on raiding from this country’s financial future to shore up the spending plans of today. Tax charges on the money people have put aside for their retirement solves a short-term problem, however it means a more impoverished retirement for millions in the future. This is not a pain-free solution and constant tinkering undermines investors’ confidence in the system.”

Property market

The latest data from the stumbling housing market has made estate agents jittery, especially as they eye the economic unknowns of the post-Brexit market.

Add the continued dampening of landlord enthusiasm thanks to a flurry of tax changes and the days of endless price rises regardless of the wider economy seem firmly in the past.

It’s no surprise that agents are crossing their fingers that the chancellor won’t do anything silly when it comes to property market or taxation tinkering.

“The government needs to reverse home ownership decline and improve rental conditions as one third of ‘Generation Rent’ may never buy,” says Jeremy Leaf, an estate agent in north London and a former residential chairman for Royal Institution for Chartered Surveyors (Rics).

“Persuading landlords to buy or not to sell or, if so, with tax breaks for sales to long-term ‘sitting’ tenants, can satisfy both and reduce upward pressure on rent.

“This will help aspiring first-time buyers. Mandatory three-year tenancies would probably also be acceptable to many landlords provided rents can be increased and tenants falling into arrears or damaging property can be removed more easily than under the current fault-based method.

“Better enforcement of existing planning regulations would increase new housing supply and housebuilders need stricter ‘use it or lose it’ rules to prevent landbanking even when sales are slow – without compromising SMEs further.

“Social/affordable housing has the potential to provide the infrastructure from which the economy can benefit. There should be more financial incentives for social and affordable housing, Build to Rent and shared ownership.”

Sole trading and small businesses

“Questions have been raised about this government’s commitment to sole traders and small firms. Monday is its chance to set the record straight,” Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) National Chairman, Mike Cherry said.

“VAT is the most time-consuming levy for small business owners to manage. A small registered firm loses six working days a year to VAT compliance on average, draining their productivity.

“Speculation about a drop in the £85,000 turnover threshold for registration is very concerning. Suddenly dragging more small firms into the VAT regime would be incredibly damaging, placing a huge admin burden on thousands of businesses and bringing them into the scope of ‘making tax digital’ by stealth.

“The chancellor should maintain the current VAT registration threshold until 2022. At the same time he should consider a smoothing mechanism – as recommended by the Office for Tax Simplification – to address the issue of small firms bunching around the £80,000 turnover mark. Doing so would incentivise small business growth rather than stifle it.”

WINTER DEATHS: THE TRUE COST OF SPIRALLING ENERGY BILLS

Saturday 27 October may or may not be an immediately significant date in your house but it’s the day millions of us start sliding helplessly into the clutches of extortionate charges at the hands of a small group of massive companies.

Why? Because it’s the day the average home flicks on the heating.

And after 18 months of relentlessly rising energy prices, this weekend – as the clocks go back and temperatures plummet – could be the start of the most expensive winter for years.

Overall energy prices have risen by 6 per cent over the last year and more than a third of Britons – about 9.5 million households – will delay switching on their heating for as long as possible in a bid to save money, according to new survey data.

“Since the latest round of energy price increases began in March 2017, the big energy companies have all raised their dual fuel standard tariffs at least once,” notes Amanda Cumine from switching service weflip.

“According to the energy regulator, Ofgem, the average yearly household energy bill is now £1,194. And yet millions of loyal energy customers are still stuck on their providers’ most expensive tariffs – where they could be paying around £352 a year too much.”

In fact, households on the big energy suppliers’ default tariffs would have to postpone switching on their heating by 18 days this winter if they wanted to keep their energy bills in line with last year. Those same households would need to brave the chill until mid-December to keep their energy bills level with those on the best fixed energy prices.

But as reports declare that the UK has one of the worst rates of excess winter deaths in Europe, in large part because thousands of people can’t afford to heat their homes, critics warn that the latest energy price cap plans have simply given the Big Six a target to aim for when it comes to bumping up those paying less than the £1,136 limit.

Ofgem, the energy watchdog, recently announced new restrictions on the maximum amount energy companies are able to charge dual-fuel customers paying by direct debit alongside prepayment and vulnerable customers. The move, which comes into effect this winter, is designed to save a total of 11 million customers currently paying the most expensive bills about £75 a year.

But since the announcement of a cap on energy prices, most energy providers have increased the price of their cheapest tariffs by 21 per cent, according to data from Moneysupermarket.

The 30 best annual dual-fuel tariffs on the market are on average £178 more expensive than the cheapest 30 were in May, rising from £864 to £1,042.

Only four of 89 tariffs are now available for under £1,000 per year.

“When Ofgem announced that they were implementing a price cap, it was immediately apparent that a cap was a defunct solution for the scale of the problem,” says Jane Lucy, chief executive and founder of The Labrador, an energy tracking and switching service.

“Price caps promote lethargy and consequently make consumers mistakenly believe that they are getting the best deal, when this is not the case. To hear that many energy providers have increased the price of their cheapest tariffs by 21 per cent succeeding the cap should not come as a surprise.

“We cannot simply introduce a cap that limits peak pricing. A range of cost options need to exist to promote a truly competitive industry that protects the loyal, the savvy and the lower income families. The only way we can ensure a competitive market is not solely with a price cap, but by enabling customers to switch energy providers with ease.”

Since the energy price cap was introduced…

British Gas increased its standard variable tariff for the second time in October, rising prices by 4 per cent, making a typical dual-fuel bill £1,205 a year.

EDF raised its standard prices for the second time in August to take its typical standard dual-fuel bill to £1,228 a year

E.on pushed up its standard prices by 4.8 per cent in August making its typical dual-fuel bill £1,208 a year

Npower hiked its standard variable tariff by 5.5 per cent in June; the typical dual-fuel bill is now £1,230 a year

Scottish Power hiked its standard tariff for the second time in October by 3.7 per cent, increasing the price to £1,257 a year

SSE raised its prices by 7.8 per cent in July. Its standard tariff is now £1,196 a year

HOW TO BEAT RECORD HIGH MORTGAGE FEES

Mortgage lenders are locked in a battle for new customers, tempting them with low interest rates.

It sounds like a win-win for homeowners, and the Bank of England base rate rise earlier this year spurred an avalanche of homeowners into remortgaging to escape higher standard variable rates or fixing their way out of painful future increases.

But research from the website Moneyfacts.co.uk shows that, while many lenders are cutting their headline rates, the mortgage arrangement fees that come with these deals are soaring.

The average mortgage fee currently stands at £1,005, according to the site, which is the highest it has been since July 2013.

“Despite the Bank of England increasing the base rate twice since November 2017 – from 0.25 per cent to the current rate of 0.75 per cent – mortgage rates are still far lower than providers’ costs,” says Charlotte Nelson, spokesperson for Moneyfacts.co.uk.

“The average two-year fixed rate only stands 0.16 per cent higher than it did in November 2017, increasing from 2.33 per cent to 2.49 per cent. By increasing fees, providers are making a small attempt to recoup some of this extra cost.”

Daniel Hegarty, founder of online mortgage broker Habito, says: “The lowest interest rates and seemingly cheapest deals are used by banks and lenders to market to customers, but they typically have larger fees, some over £1,000, which increase the overall price of the mortgage.”

Unfortunately for borrowers, high fees and low rates can simply muddy the waters further when it comes to finding the best deal. After all, for homeowners and first-time buyers who need to borrow larger sums then a low rate/high fee offer could be more competitive than a deal that has a higher rate but no fee at all.

But for borrowers who need to borrow less, a high fee can end up costing more than the low rate will save them over the term of the mortgage.

Hegarty adds: “It is better to look at the total cost – taking into account any associated fees and special offers, as well as the rate, to get the cheapest deal overall.”

Finding the best deal

But it can be hard to assess the entire cost of some deals, particularly if they come stacked with freebies.

“Many mortgage products now come with free valuations, no legal fees, the promise of cash back and more. But these usually come with higher interest rates – so can still work out as more expensive overall compared to a product that has a lower rate but higher fees and no free services or cash-back rewards,” Hegarty warns.

“Be savvy and look at the cost of legal fees versus cash-back offers to see which is the bigger incentive. With some cashback products paying as much as £500, you could be better off taking the money and still spending on associated fees.”

Nelson says: “As providers start to diversify into different sectors and types of products, the arrangement fee element of the deal allows them greater flexibility on not just the rates they offer, but the incentives they add as well.

“However, with all these extra elements, borrowers must be careful to pick the right product when choosing a mortgage.”

One real risk is that the complexity of working out which deal is best will put potential remortgagers off moving. Delaying switching to a better deal and languishing on your lender’s standard variable rate can mean spending more unnecessarily.

Hegarty adds: “It can take time to switch on to a new mortgage rate so you should start looking roughly 14 weeks to three months before your current rate expires. Planning ahead will save you being automatically transferred onto a more expensive variable rate mortgage.

“Likewise, if you switch too soon, some mortgage products will include an early repayment charge. This charge can be as much as 5 per cent of your outstanding loan, which can add up to several thousand pounds. If there is a charge, arrange for the remortgage to start the day after the penalty period ends on your current deal.”

Slowing showing

The number of customers remortgaging has started to slow, according to the latest data from UK Finance. But that could mean banks are even more keen to attract those who choose to do so.

According to the industry body, the number of mortgages approved by the main high street banks in September was 9 per cent lower than last September.

That will mean lenders could end up competing even harder to attract remortgagers, throwing in cashback and low rates and freebies and potentially offsetting them with high fees.

Nelson concludes: “For the average borrower who remortgages every two years, the fees can soon add up. The additional cash could be far better spent overpaying the mortgage.”

POINT OF SALE CREDIT – THE LATEST ROUTE TO DEBT

Ten years ago, applying for credit was a laborious process often involving reams of paperwork.

Now, technology platforms allow people to submit their application in moments and receive a response within seconds.

In this brave new fintech world, finance options such as credit and store cards are starting to look dated. Instead we’re turning to one-off credit agreements, often made at the point of purchase using services such as Klarna.

And this kind of quick application credit is being deployed at shop counters to help motivate sales.

Tony Smith, managing director of insolvency firm Company Debt, says these methods of delaying paying are soaring: “Short-term credit solutions are increasingly popular, as evidenced by the stratospheric growth of brands like Klarna and the rise of Paypal Credit.

“Klarna is reputedly one of the fastest growing companies in Europe, tripling their profits in 2017, and now serving some 70 million customers. It is fair to say short-term credit is now deeply embedded within online payments culture and used widely.”

Certainly Klarna is one of the best known providers of at-till, short-term credit. It’s been possible to spread the cost of a payment online for years; Amazon and PayPal have both offered the chance to defer or spread payments over a longer period with a simple few clicks. As the high street competes with the internet, many retailers are now offering similar opportunities to buyers.

A spokesperson for Klarna told us that this kind of frictionless transaction is becoming essential for brands that need to compete with online retailers. “Fintech has brought welcome choice and set a new benchmark on customer experience for payments, which in turn is a differentiating factor for merchants in a very competitive environment – helping them build customer loyalty,” they said.

“Shoppers today expect an intuitive and personalised user experience that is available when they need it, irrespective of time, location or what channel. They move freely between online and offline contexts and their expectations are for a consistent service.

“Pay later, for example, bridges a clear delta between online and offline shopping experiences, by giving consumers the flexibility to see and try on items before they decide to commit to purchase, similar to how they would in-store.”

Ubiquitous credit

It’s not just high street shopping that competes to offer buyers fast finance. Businesses ranging from colleges to vets are doing the same. Peter Mansfield, chief executive at payment technology provider Deko, says many different sectors are working to offer credit to their customers.

“Consumer credit needn’t be confined to retail,” he says. “We support merchants in a number of different sectors to help their customers access the things they need or want, when they need or want them.

“Such sectors include training, healthcare and travel. Payment plans range from one to three years and, generally, short-term credit wouldn’t work for these types of purchases.

“Looking to healthcare, pet-owners often face hefty bills for surgery and other treatments. In these cases, the offer of a payment plan could genuinely be the difference between life and death.”

Such credit options are often successful. Research by Deko shows that 65 per cent of customers who have used a retail finance platform say they only made the purchase because finance was available and more than a third say they are more likely to spend with a company that offers point of sale finance options.

Yet we are a country still stung by the financial crash of 10 years ago, a crash made possible in part because of all-too-easy access to credit. As fintech firms and retailers scramble to out-do each other in frictionless transactions and convenience, some analysts are concerned we’re making debt too easy and too normal.

Too easy

Moira O’Neill, head of personal finance at Interactive Investor, says she is worried about high levels of debt becoming simply part of shopping.

“‘Buy now, pay later’ schemes are essentially unsecured debt and people should be cautious about using them,” she urges.

“As a generation we are living with more debt than ever, with the average UK household debt, including mortgages, just under £60,000 and overall in the UK people owe nearly £1.6 trillion, up from £1.55 trillion last year. Shoppers who succumb to using these schemes need to be careful – they can become crippling if not addressed or looked after.

“Those who use it responsibly will find it a useful tool but some users may find it leads to bad habits.”

Certainly retailers on and offline are aware that by offering easy credit options at the till they are more likely to make a sale. In this tough climate, that’s a big benefit for businesses.

Just this week, Game announced it had partnered with Experian and Close Brothers Retail Finance to allow customers to text a number displayed in store to find out quickly and easily if they are likely to be accepted for finance on consoles and other major gaming products.

That doesn’t make it easier to be accepted for credit but it does remove a further barrier, namely the awkwardness of applying for credit in the store in person, without knowing if it’s likely you’ll be accepted.

Certainly Abby Vickers, credit risk director at Close Brothers Retail Finance, believes this will boost sales: “This self-serve facility offers a seamless experience to in-store shoppers and can help boost consumer confidence by giving an indication of their likelihood of acceptance for credit before they apply.

“This offers a great experience for shoppers and in these tough market conditions this can help retailers to reach new customers and fuel much needed growth.”

Yet if seamless shopping experiences that boost consumer confidence when applying for credit mean greater numbers of people applying for credit then, O’Neill says, that risks storing up future problems for a lot of current shoppers.

“In the past, there was a psychological barrier involved of people being embarrassed about being in debt, but for younger generations, I worry that this may be changing,” she explains.

“A little bit of extra debt on top of your car loan, like these buy now pay later schemes, may not seem like a big deal but this is where people are going to get into trouble.”

Yet others argue that this form of fast, low-cost, at-till credit is simply helpful for shoppers. Gary Rohloff is the founder of Laybuy, an online and in-store credit provider that automatically takes repayment weekly over the following six weeks.

He says millennials, in particular, have been turned off traditional credit and store cards for fear of spiralling debt but that this short-term credit provides one-off borrowing options.

“These new, more transparent relationships are giving shoppers confidence and greater control of spending limits; a brave new world that can – and is – being embraced by wise millennials,” he says.

“For retailers battling through troubled waters, promoting a store credit card to someone in their twenties isn’t likely to result in a positive action and could actually turn them away from a brand altogether. Providing shoppers with alternative ways to pay, whilst also giving them control and reducing any risk of piling up huge debts helps engage millennials and increase their brand loyalty.”

Whether easily applied for credit is an issue for consumers or not, fintech advances and a high street that’s increasingly desperate to secure sales means we’re likely to see more and more credit options as we shop.

FIVE MONEY MANAGEMENT RULES TO LIVE BY

Money management in the 21st century is a noisy business.

Everywhere you look, everything you read, the advice on how to look after your assets seems complex and contradictory.

And yet the stakes are increasingly high. Get it wrong, fail to act, have faith in the wrong businesses or people and you’ll lose your money we’re frantically told.

Scams abound, stock markets are jittery and the financial products we think we can rely on have small print exemptions that require you to be an expert to successfully interpret.

But if you step back from all that, as well as the PPI claims adverts, funeral plan free gifts and shouty social media millionaires promising to show you how they make thousands of pounds a minute from a lilo in their pool, the best advice consistently boils down to a few key rules.

Here they are.

Assume nothing

New research from Which? this week, suggests thousands of people could be due additional PPI compensation because their bank only checked the policies the customer named in their claim, rather than everything in their name.

Then there’s the news that banks will finally be checking the name of the payee when you make a transfer to ensure the details all match up – in other words making sure that you haven’t hit a single digit incorrectly and instead of sending cash to your beloved six-year-old niece in Wolverhampton, you’re unwittingly boosting the current account of a 40-something telecoms engineer from Edinburgh.

The correct response to these developments is, of course: “Why isn’t this already happening?”

But there are thousands of common sense gaps like this across the endless number of financial, business and government processes that we interact with throughout our lives.

Assume nothing can be left to some vague notion of communal common sense in any transaction, application or complaint. Check everything, then check it again. Keep a record of any important to-ing and fro-ing you have to make, including dates and times of calls or meetings, who you spoke to and what you discussed. And follow up with everything. Just in case.

Assumption goes both ways though. Billions of pounds worth of benefits goes unclaimed every year, for example, often because people simply believe they’re not entitled to them. Be sure before you make decisions based on what you believe is the case.

Take your time

As the Financial Conduct Authority rolls out new adverts in its war against pensions scammers this week, the most pertinent advice for anyone making a financial decision – prompted by others or not – is to slow everything down.

Most of us aren’t city traders who have to make split-second decisions on a minute-by-minute basis, so regardless of how much pressure we feel under, there are, in fact, very few occasions when we have to make a snap choice.

As more and more people become victims of fraudsters who often use pressure techniques to panic people into making snap decisions, the authorities regularly urge consumers to step back and think carefully about whether they’re being told the truth.

Nor are these “act now” messages restricted to illegal activities, as you’ll know if you’ve ever shopped for, well anything. From financial providers to auction sites, clothes to holidays, we are constantly bombarded by those trying to cash in on our £1.06bn impulse spending habit every year.

Don’t fall for it. There are virtually no genuine retail finance decisions that have to be made by consumers that fast.

You’re in the position of power – with fraudsters, with salespeople and with financial providers. Use it by stepping back and assessing the situation objectively and rationally. The world definitely won’t end while you do.

Take control

But that doesn’t mean it pays to do nothing either. (Unless you’re an investor with twitchy fingers wondering if you can “time” the stock market and make an extra few pounds. You can’t.)

Yet more data out this week shows the cost of personal finance “paralysis” costs UK consumers almost £19bn every year.

Not switching to a more competitive mortgage rate costs us £2.5bn a year, failing to consolidate credit card debts leaves us £10.5bn worse off and leaving personal loans where they are brings with it an unnecessary bill of £5.7bn.

Overwhelmed by choice, the research from fintech lending platform Freedom Finance found it takes an average of 21 minutes for a consumer comparing personal finance options to feel overwhelmed by the process and give up.

A quarter of consumers said a fear of missing out on “a better deal out there” has stopped them from making important personal finance decisions.

Don’t give up. It pays to persevere.

Keep track

It sounds obvious, but huge swathes of society are losing their own money because they can’t find their policies and accounts or the organisations can’t find them.

Last month, we reported that the government is struggling to track down millions of child trust fund recipients because their addresses are out of date.

Fears are also growing over the fraud risks to the consumer bank balance when we move house and fail to change our details.

Around seven million people admit to losing track of their finances, NS&I has warned this week.

And now, research by the Pensions Policy Institute for the Association of British Insurers has discovered that about £19.4bn worth of pension savings have been lost – roughly £13,000 per pot.

“Losing track of £13k sounds like a pretty challenging thing to do, but it’s worryingly easier than you think when it comes to pensions, particularly, for the current working generation who are switching jobs frequently and likely to be auto-enrolled into a company scheme each time,” warns Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at Quilter.

“It’s important to keep track of your pensions, but even if you don’t, all is not lost. One of your first steps as you approach retirement should be to track down all your pension funds. The government provides a free online pensions service, which allows you to search for lost workplace pensions or a financial adviser can help.

“Once you’ve tracked down all your funds you should consider whether it is worth combining all your pensions into a single plan. This may provide you with a clearer picture of how best to plan for the rest of your retirement; means you only have to manage one pot rather than several and may also mean your fees are lower.”

Be responsible

We don’t mean to come over all Daily Mail on this one, but it is clear that the level and scope of state support is migrating permanently towards a new leaner model. But our expectations are not going with them.

When it comes to retirement and social care in particular, endless pieces of research show a huge discrepancy between what we expect the state to provide, the quality of life that provision will give us, and how much we need to have saved ourselves to live the life we look forward to after working.

Most of us believe £100,000 in retirement savings should do it and more than a fifth of adults believe they only need up to £50,000 for their pension pot, totalling approximately £3,333 a year, according to the latest data from personal finance comparison site, finder.com, out this week.

That’s dramatically below the recommended pension pot required for a comfortable retirement.

As the current state pension sits at just £8,767.20 per year, the recommended pension pot is from £260,000 to £445,000, depending on whether you’ll still be renting or paying a mortgage in retirement.

If you want financial security these days, you’re going to have to pay for it.

Feel free to stamp your feet over generational inequality or the shortcomings of the welfare state all you like, but put as much cash aside as you can in the meantime or revise down your big retirement dreams.

IS FINANCIAL FEAR 'REMODELING' YOUR BRAIN?

If life’s under control right now, don’t bother reading any further.

If you’re worried, you’re not alone.

We know we have a debt problem. We know our relationship with credit is now as high as it was before the financial crisis.

In fact, debt plays such a big part in many of our lives that a third of us don’t believe we’ll ever be debt free.

One in 10 don’t even believe they’ll be able to reduce the amount they owe in their lifetime, according to figures from Equifax.

Then there’s our lack of savings as we face down the economic no man’s land otherwise known as Brexit – whenever that actually happens.

A third of working Britons have a month’s salary or less stashed away and depending on whose data you believe anything from one in seven to one in four have no savings at all. Their experience of money varies wildly from the people who can and do save. They put away an average of £310 a month per person, making the average savings pot around £10,500, a study by employee benefits business Neyber has found.

And yet most of us have experienced difficult, and often financially damaging situations. Over the last two years a fifth of us have been made redundant, one in 10 have had a serious accident and 14 per cent have got divorced.

No wonder financial fear has reached epidemic proportions. More than 80 per cent of British adults say the wake up at night worrying, often at least once a week, according to a new study that examines the financial fortitude of consumers and its knock-on effect on mental health.

How to make money last until payday, debt, and their salary not supporting both the long-term and dependents are among the biggest financial worries facing consumers.

More than a third of adults say they are not financially robust, says Zurich UK’s Cost of Resilience report. As a direct result, almost half of us don’t feel in control of our lives. More than a quarter are already feeling negative about their future, even before experiencing any number of very common financial “shocks”.

The study also found that more women – as many as 90 per cent – than men say they wake up at night worrying. And the older you are the more likely you are to miss out on sleep because of stress.

The most common worries facing UK adults

1. My health – 37 per cent

2. The health of my partner, family, friends etc – 32 per cent

3. My relationship with my partner, family and friends – 23 per cent

4. How to make my money last until the next time I get money – 19 per cent

5. Debts – 17 per cent

6. The security of my job – 10 per cent

7. Looking after elderly relatives – 10 per cent

8. My salary is enough to support me in the long-term – 10 per cent

9. If my salary is enough to support me and my dependents in the long-term – 9 per cent

10. How to afford a new home – 8 per cent

Source: Zurich UK

But a lack of sleep isn’t just about dark circles and short tempers, warns neuroscientist Dr Jack Lewis: “Worrying too much can negatively impact our ability to get a good night’s sleep, which is vitally important because sleep gives our brains the opportunity to do a variety of essential tasks, from consolidating memories to removing toxic metabolic waste.”

If people regularly wake up during the night, these functions are compromised. And in the long run that’s really bad news for the brain. Chronic stress is potentially damaging to a person’s health even if it doesn’t affect their sleep.

“The stress hormone cortisol is released into the bloodstream and travels around body and brain to help release the extra energy and resources that help us to deal with the stress,” adds Lewis.

“Constantly worrying about finances means having chronically elevated cortisol levels, which gradually wears us down. In extreme cases, it can actually remodel certain brain areas.”

Of course, businesses including Zurich, which sells insurance products, urge us to buy products that will alleviate the financial effects of a sudden “shock” event like becoming seriously ill, losing our jobs or our relationships breaking down.

Of these, though life insurance is most common, income protection can be especially useful as it will pay a monthly amount until retirement if necessary, though very few people have this kind of cover.

Don’t confuse income protection with highly controversial payment protection insurance (PPI) though – the subject of that infamous misselling scandal – which only covers you for a short period and typically only for a single payment, such as your mortgage.

Meanwhile, mental health charity Mind suggests a two-pronged approach to overcoming stress and anxiety, working to overcome the external pressures while building up emotional resilience. Find out more here.

PAYDAY LENDERS MUST OFFER COMPENSATION FOR MIS-SOLD CREDIT, SAYS FCA

Payday lenders should offer compensation to customers who may have been mis-sold expensive loans, even if it threatens the company with bankruptcy, the City watchdog has said.

The Financial Conduct Authority said payday lenders should contact customers about potential compensation if creditworthiness assessments were not compliant.

Lenders should inform the regulator to immediately if they may be unable to meet their financial commitments due to the cost of reimbursing customers.

The warning comes after the collapse of Wonga in August. The lender had been one of the most well-known providers of high-cost credit but a crackdown by the FCA and a large rise in complaints made it unprofitable.

The lender said its struggles were due to a “significant” industrywide increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

It blamed claims management companies for the rise, but said it was making progress against a transformation plan set out for the business.

The FCA said it was particularly concerned about chains of loans, where an individual borrows repeatedly over an extended period.

It also follows the failure of payday lender Wonga in August, which collapsed following a jump in customer compensation claims after a crackdown on the sector in Britain.

MOST CAR-SELLERS RECEIVE LESS THAN THEIR INITIAL VALUATION, NEW RESEARCH WARNS

They’ve never enjoyed a squeaky clean reputation, but used car dealers are being accused of widespread “price chipping” after a new study found only 40 per cent of sellers receive the full valuation initially offered online.

An in-depth investigation into online used car sales by Motorway.co.uk has found that some instant car-buying websites quote unrealistically high car valuations online to attract customers, but then offer significantly less on the actual day of sale.

The car-selling comparison site argues the practice, known in the industry as price chipping, has become so commonplace that six out of 10 car-sellers received less than their original online valuation on the day of sale.

The investigations revealed that prices were “chipped” by 6 per cent on average – slicing around £600 from a vehicle worth £10,000.

To collate its figures, Motorway analysed more than 4,000 completed sale transactions through instant online car-buyers featured on its website, supplementing this data by surveying customers that sold to other car buyers that don’t feature.

Motorway compared the actual sale prices received for each car sold with its original online valuation. It found that while cars valued above £5,000 were chipped down by 6 per cent on average, for those below £5,000, the average “chip down” was as high as 11 per cent.

A 6 per cent chip down on a high-end car valued at £35,000 would mean a £2,000 reduction in the price at the point of sale. On a car valued at £4,550, an 11 per cent reduction would see the valuation reduced by £500 on inspection.

But Motorway’s data showed that not all car-buying services take the same approach. Some do offer realistic valuations online, which rarely change by much at all on the day of sale, while others have an average chip down rate of up to 14 per cent.

“Many sellers simply don’t have time to wait for offers on classified sites or to drive between car dealerships to negotiate a good price,” says Alex Buttle, director at Motorway.

“It’s why the instant online car-buying industry is growing at around 15 per cent a year.

“But speed and convenience should not mean consumers have to accept unnecessary price reductions as part and parcel of selling online.

Not all buyers routinely inflate their online valuations, but sadly chipping has become so widespread that many consumers have already accepted it as common practice.

“Unrealistic online valuations could really damage the reputation of this growing industry if it’s not tackled head-on.

“Price transparency has transformed every other e-commerce space, it’s about time the car industry embraced the inevitable transition to a consumer-first, data-led experience.

“Car-sellers deserve to be empowered with technology and should never be treated like ‘valuation victims’.”

Why are prices reduced on the day of sale?

Professional car-buyers have to make reasonable assumptions on the condition and history of a vehicle in order to generate an instant valuation online, and this is notoriously difficult. If a buyer assumes that a car being valued is in “fair-to-good” condition, they should expect the car to have some wear and tear consistent with its age and mileage and present a valuation that reflects this.

While some changes to online prices are inevitable, some buyers assume all used cars valued are in perfect showroom condition despite their age – and very few are. This leads to significant reductions for typical vehicles when light scratches, dents and other normal wear and tear is revealed on the day of sale.

Motorway found that sales were much less likely to fall through when buyers priced realistically.

But dealers dispute the comparison site’s findings.

A spokesperson for webuyanycar.com said: “Motorway are a comparison website rather than a car-buying service and their statements do not match our experience. As their comparison data does not include damage adjustment it is not truly reflective of a vehicle’s actual market value and is potentially misleading motorists.

“At webuyanycar.com we guarantee to give the price we quote, if however there is damage on the vehicle that hasn’t been declared, then the price will be adjusted in line with this.

“Webuyanycar.com provides a convenient service which allows motorists to sell their car often within a matter of hours, free-from the hassles and risks associated with a private sale.”

'SHOULD I SHRED MY BANKSY?' AND OTHER ART INVESTMENT QUESTIONS

It was a beautiful moment.

A print of Banksy’s famous Girl With Balloon sold for more than £1m at a Sotheby’s auction last Friday, only to immediately pass through a concealed shredder within the frame, provoking gasps and horror from the audience.

The new owner presumably at least gasped and probably swore, but they shouldn’t have worried.

Shortly after the event, it was estimated by several art dealers that the painting had probably increased in value by between 50 per cent and 100 per cent.

Then, as if the performance itself wasn’t bizarre enough, My Art Broker tweeted to ask Banksy owners to resist shredding their own works.

The warning came too late for one of their would-be customers. Ian Syer, co-founder of MyArtBroker.com, said a potential customer had approached them, having shredded the bottom of their limited edition of Girl With Balloon in the hope of enhancing its value.

“What this person today seems to have done is needlessly ruin a print worth around £40,000 and reduce its value to almost nothing,” he said. “We strongly recommend nobody else takes valuable art and tries to cash in on what history will judge a simply brilliant stunt.”

It’s a great story that you have to hope was just the owner joking around. Few of us are fortunate enough to own limited edition Banksy prints, let alone be stupid enough to copycat shred them.

But more people are buying art, especially younger people. Investing in art is not just for older, wealthier people. Research carried out by US Trust, the private wealth management division of Bank of America, shows that baby boomers are the dominant generation of art collectors but that millennials are the fastest-growing segment, with ownership up 8 per cent year-on-year.

The Deloitte Art and Finance Report revealed that 5 per cent of collectors are now consequently purchasing art with an eye for long-term investment.

Quick tips for would-be investors

Know the risks

Susan Eyres, owner of the Gateway Gallery in Hale, Greater Manchester, speaks to lots of would-be art investors and says there’s lots of interest in art as an alternative investment.

But she warns: “Art is an unregulated market. In the financial investing world, the consumer is protected by the Financial Conduct Authority or the Financial Ombudsman. There are strict rules on misselling and you have to be qualified and approved to offer advice to clients.

“Even in this regulatory environment, examples of financial scandals and misselling are too numerous to list. None of this applies to the art market – it truly is buyer beware.”

Be aware of bubbles

Anita Choudhrie, founder the Stellar International Art Foundation, warns: “Bubbles can emerge and this should not be forgotten. A global art market index published by the University of Luxembourg discovered that prices for contemporary and post-war art fell by 21 per cent and auction sales declined by 29 per cent, despite more paintings being sold in 2016.

“These concerns have been somewhat alleviated by record breaking sales in 2017, but the fact that reputable artists like Bacon and Rothko suffered 20 per cent falls in price is cause for caution.

“Any engagement with the global arts markets therefore necessitates careful consideration of volatile trends, extreme diligence and a reasonable degree of luck. Art needs to be invested in like a monetary asset if it is to act like one.”

Ask for help

Mary Claire Boyd, fair director of the Winter Art and Antiques Fair Olympia, says it’s vital you never feel stupid for asking questions, especially about the price of a piece.

“Don’t be intimated by an art dealer’s knowledge – learn from it, use it,” she says. “They have probably been studying their area for over 20 years and are happy to talk about the history of a work and why it is special. This will help you understand the price.

“Pricing can seem mysterious as every piece is unique so has to be priced as such but it will be affected by rarity, materials (oils paintings are more valuable than prints), craftsmanship and, like so many other things, current taste and fashion.”

Invest for the long term

Eyres adds: “Our rule of thumb is that you have made a good investment if you hold a painting for about seven years and can get back for it what you paid‎. After this period you should, given all the above, be moving into profit.

“We recommend a minimum holding period of 10 years. This might seem, on its face, a little unexciting – but it actually represents a good return on your money.”

Watch the market

Artist Kate Brinkworth says: “If you have a good eye and a good hunch that it is a quality piece of work both in its ideas and its execution, then it stands a chance that it will be a wise investment for your own satisfaction and the chance that someone else will think the same if you wish to resell.

“But it also depends on your reasons for owning art, for investment, for collection, for your own love of the piece? The market is fickle, goes in fashions and cycles.

“One hint for the moment is investing in women’s art. Galleries such as the Uffizi are including more women to their collections and recent sales in New York of female artists are at a high.”

Buy originals if you can

While Banksy prints may be worth a fortune, it’s good to invest in originals when you can, especially when it’s with newer artists whose work might be more affordable. For the better known artists, of course, a print might be the only affordable way in.

Lucinda Costello, fair director of the Affordable Art Fair, says: “Invest in original art. Buying art can be a great investment for the entrepreneurial collectors out there, who get a thrill from finding up-and-coming artists, perhaps at recent graduate shows, and just having a hunch that they’re going to make it big.

“Or, you may be keen to invest in an artist who is already established: many Affordable Art Fair artists are now household names, so picking up a sought-after Mark Quinn or Damien Hirst print is a great way to invest in a well-known artist, whilst still being on a budget.”

Buy what you love

Ian Weatherby-Blythe, group managing director of Washington Green Fine Art and the Castle Fine Art network of galleries, said: “In recent years, the global art market has hugely increased in value, leading some to see art as a huge investment opportunity.

“Buying art is a very personal thing – I think you should always buy a piece of art because you love it, not to make money from it. However, a lot of people do buy art as an investment and do very well out of it.”

Educate your eye

Buying what you love is probably the best advice out there, but art collector Victor Benady recommends taking time to learn about art so you can really find what it is you love best.

“You need to work out what it is you actually love and that comes down to research and training your eye,” he says. “Instagram is a pretty good starting point but can be misleading as most people on there have an agenda, so download a mobile app like Artland.

“[That] allows you to explore the collections of more experienced collectors and of your generation and what galleries are offering them. Develop your critical perspective and take that out in to the real world so that you can begin to filter the huge amount of noise out there.”

Buying what you like can pay…

This isn’t the first time Banksy has riffed off the commercialism of art. Back in 2014, the artist erected a pop-up art stall in New York’s Central Park and flogged a series of original signed prints for $60 (£45).

No one realised who the seller was and so only people who genuinely loved the work bothered to buy it. Two of those canvasses later sold for £120,000. So maybe buying what you like really is key to investing in art. At least then you can enjoy owning it no matter what happens to its value.

WHAT’S NEXT FOR GENERATION RENT?

Back in 1996 more than 90 per cent of young adults would have been able to buy a home in their local area. Today, even with a significant deposit, only around 60 per cent would be able to borrow enough to buy even the cheapest properties where they live.

After adjusting for inflation, average house prices in England have risen by 173 per cent since 1997, compared with increases in young adults’ real incomes of only 19 per cent. It means the share of 25- to 34-year-olds who own their own home fell from 55 per cent to 35 per cent in the twenty years to 2017, according to new figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

Numerous government schemes have been launched in those years to try to deliver on the expectation that we can all own property. Few have had any effect other than to push prices even further out of arm’s reach.

So is it finally time to turn our backs on ownership? And if you know you won’t be in a position to buy, what does your financial future look like?

The bad news

Not forking out a huge lump sum won’t leave you any better off, in fact one of the reasons for pushing home ownership at a policy level is that you will pay far more for your rent over the rest of your life than you’d pay in mortgage costs, with no asset at the end of it.

There’s also the small matter of trying to find rent each month after you retire.

Over a 50 year lifetime, renting in Virginia Water, Surrey, will set you back almost £2.5m. In Ascot it’s around £2m.

Even in the most affordable locations in the country, such as Annan in Dumfries and Galloway, a lifetime’s renting will still come in at around £200,000 in today’s prices according to a new online tool that shows users what rent for the next 50 years will cost in their postcode compared with owning.

Nor are costs likely to get cheaper.

Average rents across the UK rose by 1.7 per cent in September 2018 compared with the same month last year. It makes the average monthly rent now £943. Excluding London, where the average rent is now £1,640 – up 3 per cent last month, prices still come in at £780 a month.

“Rental prices have for the large part, continued their upward trend although this muted rate of growth will at least be welcomed by the nation’s tenants,” says Adam Male, director of lettings at urban.co.uk.

“However, this week’s second reading of the tenant fee bill along with the current political climate and previous restrictions on the buy-to-let sector is creating a recipe for increased turbulence in the UK rental sector.

“Brexit aside, the perseverance of the government to re-level the lettings playing field in favour of the tenant is going to exacerbate the current friction point rather than reduce it.

“We’ve already seen a mass migration of landlords leaving the buy-to-let sector and if this continues, a drastic reduction in rental stock will lead to a sharp uplift in rents.

“Couple this with the potential, additional costs passed on by letting agents through no default fees in order to sidestep a fee ban, and the rental sector looks set to become even more unaffordable.”

Any good news?

Believe it or not there are a few positives.

“As a renter you have none of the ongoing costs of owning property, including maintenance – often forgotten in renting versus purchasing comparisons,” says Annabel Speakman, independent financial adviser at Amicus Wealth. “Any issues go straight to your landlord.

“Yes, in the long term a mortgage is cheaper but rates are incredibly low right now. In the 1980s mortgage rates were in double figures so the cost of borrowing was significantly more expensive. That’s a worrying precedent for homeowners that could push their costs sky high in future if we saw such high interest rates again.”

There are no costs associated with trading up either. Ranging from solicitor, estate agent and new mortgage fees to stamp duty, the process of buying, selling, and moving home comes in at an average of £12,000 each time, according to new research from Lloyds Bank.

“It’s also important to remember that good tenants are in the driver’s seat, so it’s worth negotiating a better, or long-term fixed rental price,” adds Speakman. “Don’t forget that as a renter you’ll be much more flexible when it comes to school catchment areas or career relocation.

“You can focus on building up cash for other opportunities and there’s always the potential to look at buy-to-let investments in cheaper areas.

“But without the chance to downsize your home to access pension or care funds, Generation Renters will need to be very aware of the need to build up long term assets to safeguard their future.”

YOUNG ADULTS IN 2018 FINANCIALLY WEAKER THAN TWENTY-SOMETHINGS IN 2008

Today’s young adults own less property, are less likely to have any savings and are less resilient than twenty-somethings a decade ago.

Figures out this week from the Office for National Statistics show home ownership among 22- to 29-year-olds has plummeted by 10 percentage points since 2008 to only 27 per cent.

They’re also less likely to have money set aside. In just four years, between 2010 and 2014, the number of twenty-somethings with any savings at all dropped from 59 per cent to 47 per cent.

But the numbers also show a large divide between the haves and have-nots, even among such young adults.

The highest earning 10 per cent of 22- to 29-year-olds were paid at least 4.3 times as much per week as the lowest earners in 2017.

Those with savings now have significantly more than they would have done a decade ago – an average of £1,600, up from £900, though the number of savers in this age group has dropped.

The top 10 per cent of savers has at least £15,000, while the bottom 10 per cent has saved less than £100.

Meanwhile, the 10 per cent most indebted owed at least £14,200 in 2014 to 2016, while the 10 per cent least indebted owed £100 or less.

“The figures provide glimpses of positivity about the finances of the UK’s millennial generation, however, these glimpses are shrouded in an unenviable fog of limited savings and significant debt,” says Rachael Griffin, tax and financial planning specialist at wealth management firm Quilter.

“The data shows 37 per cent of young people now have financial debt compared to 49 per cent between 2008-2010. While this is something to be pleased about, these figures do not include student loans, which a substantial proportion of this population will face.

“While on the face of it [the figures on saving rates] is worrying, the statistic doesn’t explore the fact that pensions auto-enrolment now means younger people are putting away money for a retirement, even if arguably at very low levels.

“Furthermore, the data suggest there is a strain between saving for later life and earning enough to be able to save in a more liquid manner. This lack of accessible savings could mean that any unexpected expense could push this group into a tricky financial situation which would then result in them having to enter into debt or being reliant on the bank of mum and dad.”

But financial strength is also closely linked to emotional resilience.

A recent study into the overall financial resilience of under-35s found that a quarter of 18- to 24-year-olds and half of 25- to 34-year-olds simply aren’t financially robust. In other words they would struggle to recover from a financial shock or loss of income.

A third of 18-24-year-olds, and a further third of 25-34-year-olds do not feel emotionally resilient, according to the research by Zurich.

“It’s a tough time financially for consumers, but particularly for young people,” says Rose St Louis of Zurich UK.

“Soaring house prices and increasing rent costs are making owning your home a pipe dream.

“While wage growth is starting to pick up, months of low wages coupled with high inflation and soaring university debt, is impacting how resilient young people feel with their finances.”

But it’s not all doom and gloom, there are steps young people can take to improve their finances.

Feeding a small amount each month into a stocks and shares ISA or a pension fund is a sensible way to build a healthy sum over the years. Similarly, making the most of government products when saving for a first home, such as a Help to Buy ISA or LISA can bring huge benefits over time.

“Younger generations need to have it instilled in them that having a healthy savings account is essential,” urges Griffin. “Research shows that, like many behaviours, our attitudes to money are shaped at a young age. The Money Advice Service has shown that many key financial habits are set by the age of seven.

“It’s incredibly important that the government gives thorough consideration to the introduction of financial education onto the primary school curriculum. Doing so will help tackle financial illiteracy and show children early on the merits of saving, and hopefully avoid a situation where we find in another 10 years a generation of 18- to 29-year-olds with even less in their savings accounts.”

HSBC PUBLISHES FAIRY TALE TO HELP CHILDREN ACHIEVE FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE

Cinderella’s Fairy Godmother appears.

“You shall go to the ball, Cinderella,” she says, “but you don’t need to marry a prince to get away from all this…”

“Now you come to mention it,” says Cinderella, “I have always wanted to design sports shoes.”

Would you read your children a bedtime story commissioned by your bank?

Because one has just published a new “fairer” fairy tale that it hopes will help girls and boys aim for financial independence.

Almost two-thirds of girls say they “don’t understand money” compared with just half of boys the same age.

That is according to new research from HSBC that suggests the financial gender gap is well in place by age 10.

Girls were also less likely than boys to say they were good with their pocket money, at 43 per cent compared with 51 per cent.

And 34 per cent of parents with daughters said they avoid discussing money in front of their children, compared with just 24 per cent of parents with sons.

Fairer tales

The bank has collaborated with children’s author Emma Dodd to publish a new story: Fairer Tales: Princesses are doing it for themselves, which can be downloaded online and is set to be sent out to the nation’s primary schools.

In the book, Cinderella starts a business, Sleeping Beauty’s savings grow while she sleeps and Rapunzel chops off her hair to make a ladder for herself rather than a prince before redeveloping the tower with a bank loan.

It is fun and subversive even if it is not quite Frozen. But, while HSBC’s campaign is laudable, are parents really likely to read a book that’s being published by their bank?

And is one book enough to drown out the flood of information that delivers the opposite messages?

I shared the story with some friends who have young daughters and read it to my own sons too.

For some children, the message of the story was lost because they did not fully understand the traditional ideas it was subverting.

Rachael Richards read it to her seven-year-old, who wasn’t particularly moved: “I think the moral of the story was a bit beyond Olivia. She didn’t really relate to the princesses providing for themselves instead of relying on the prince. This could be a good thing – perhaps as she isn’t under the impression that the princesses were reliant on the men in the first place.”

But for Jill Smith’s older daughter Alexa, aged nine, the book’s message was powerful: “I liked that the princesses used their brains and cleverness to make their dreams come true,” Alexa says.

In fact, Jill was even able to use the ideas of saving pocket money and starting up businesses to discuss earning interest and taking out small business loans with her daughter.

“I love the nice car and they can have great holidays because they earn lots of money,” says Alexa. “I best get on and do my maths and reading so I can be them.”

Not all kids took quite such positive messages from the story. I read it to my seven-year-old son who says: “Why doesn’t Cinderella just marry the prince and then she’ll have lots of money to make her shoes with?”

Maybe he believes that privilege and brains play a significant role in success.

And some parents were suspicious of why a bank would be publishing a story. Andrew Lowe, who has twin daughters aged 10, read the book when we asked but says he wouldn’t normally consider reading them a book issued by a bank.

“I did read this to my girls and they actually really enjoyed it,” he says. “But I just can’t imagine downloading and reading a book from a bank normally. I even read it through first to make sure it wasn’t full of advertising.”

Youthful lessons

One story might provoke some good discussions and the portrayal of princesses and girls in stories is gradually changing.

But parents of girls and boys are more aware than ever that they play a role in helping their children develop sound financial behaviours.

A study commissioned by the Money Advice Service and carried out by behaviour experts at Cambridge University has shown that the money habits of adults are typically formed in childhood.

It found that by age seven, most children understand the basic concepts of money and are also capable of more complex behaviours such as planning ahead and delaying a decision.

However, children under eight have not developed an understanding of the difference between luxuries and necessities yet.

As the parent of three boys under eight who behave as if I am denying them food when I refuse to buy Lego Minifigs, I can definitely attest to the truth of that.

There are many ways that parents can help their children learn positive financial lessons, we covered several at the start of the summer holidays, but talking about money is probably one of the most important.

Yet the HSBC research suggests that girls in particular need financial conversations that will give them the confidence they need to make the most of their money as adults.

That lower confidence in the early years appears to translate into similar behaviours as adults; the latest Disposable Income Index shows that less than one in three women describe themselves as very or extremely confident when it comes to managing their finances, compared with almost half of men.

That mirrors HSBC’s research among primary school children. One surprising fact from the bank’s study is that parents are more likely to discuss money with boys than girls.

Almost two-thirds of boys had received a talk about money, compared with only half of girls the same age.

Perhaps it’s not just traditional fairy tales that are old fashioned and need to change.

SCAM VICTIMS FACE POSTCODE LOTTERY OVER SUPPORT AS THEFTS TOP £500M SO FAR THIS YEAR

As new figures reveal the true extent of the nation’s battle with fraud, an investigation into the way trading standards and other authorities deal with the aftermath has revealed the different attitudes towards those who have been targeted by criminals.

The latest numbers show scammers stole £500m from UK bank accounts in the first six months of 2018 alone. More than £145m was taken in “push payment” scams, made by the victim after being tricked into authorising a payment to the fraudster according to data from UK Finance, the banking and finance trade body.

The remaining £358m was stolen in unauthorised theft – taken by a third party without the owner’s knowledge or permission. They’re often purchase scams, when the victim pays for a product or service which never arrives. In these cases, victims typically receive a full refund.

But for victims of fraud who were duped into handing over their cash by con artists through a variety of techniques so far this year, just £31m of the £145m was refunded by the bank or building society. Nor can they be certain of adequate support as victims of crime.

When people have been scammed it is often reported to local authorities. Their trading standards departments will often deal with the victim. But a series of freedom of information requests to the trading standards departments of 107 county, metropolitan borough and London councils shows a huge variation in the kind of guidance, information and support victims of fraud receive. That’s despite thousands of first-time fraud victims being targeted repeatedly thanks to so-called “sucker” lists.

The requests, submitted by Royal London, asked how many scam referrals the departments had received over the past two years, how many had been visited by a member of trading standards and what support they had been given. Responses ranged widely with some saying that all victims were visited, or at least asked if they would like to receive a visit. Others only visited a proportion of potential victims while others chose to signpost victims to other support services such as Age UK and Victim Support.

For example, the trading standards departments covering Buckinghamshire and Surrey received 6854 referrals over the past two years of which 944 received a visit from trading standards.

Meanwhile Somerset and Devon received 1367 referrals of which 87 received a visit. Around 60 per cent of councils said they offered call blockers while around half said they offered help with scam mail, either shredding it or removing it from victims’ homes. Notably many councils referred scam victims to befriending services that flag social isolation and loneliness as key reasons why someone might be targeted by fraudsters.

Other methods councils use to support scam victims include liaising with wider family to support the victim. Some councils will even contact suspected fraudsters to reclaim money or cheques. Councils such as Bexley, Hounslow and Dorset refer victims on to befriending services such as The Silver Line. Oxfordshire County Council supports Thames Valley Police’s implementation of The Banking Protocol which sees enforcement agencies and financial institutions working together.

Bank employees are trained to recognise the signs that someone might be being exploited and can raise the alarm. And Sheffield Metropolitan Borough Council provides information to local lunch clubs to raise awareness. While agencies such as the National Trading Standards Scams team work with councils to locate and support victims, many trading standards teams lack the resources to engage with all potential victims.

Helen Morrissey, a commentator for Royal London, said: “Being targeted by fraudsters can have a huge effect on victims and they need to know where to go for support. However, the responses we received show that despite the great work of many councils and groups such as the NTS Scams team, many trading standards departments are struggling to deal with the volume of scam reports they receive.

“Without adequate support victims may struggle to recover from their ordeal or find that they continue to be targeted by fraudsters,” she says. “The fear is that if trading standards teams continue to be under resourced they will be unable to meet the increased demand for their services which is a win for the scammers who are already doing too much damage.”

Meanwhile, new rules published last week could mean those who are tricked into transferring money to criminals could be reimbursed by their bank or building society.

Though the rules are voluntary, customers could get their money back if they have taken adequate care with their details and security – in other words that the fraudsters managed to convince otherwise careful consumers that they were legitimate. The code drawn up by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) aims to make it tougher for criminals and sets out how consumers can protect themselves and get protection and support from their banks.

THIRD OF BRITONS BELIEVE THEY WILL NEVER CLEAR THEIR DEBTS

Almost a third of British people believe they will never clear their debts in their lifetimes and more than one in 10 say they won’t even be able to reduce their debt levels.

Research by Equifax and Gorkana, seen exclusively by The Independent, reveals that people aged between 18 and 24, in particular, believe they face a lifetime of debt, with just half saying they expect to ever be able get back into the black.

Students graduate with an average debt of £46,000, according to an Institute for Fiscal Studies report out last year, and students from the poorest backgrounds graduate with debts of more than £57,000.

In fact, the vast majority of graduates – 81 per cent – will never clear their debt in full, which means they’ll spend the first 30 years of their working lives with a debt hanging over them.

Debt levels across society are rising; figures from the Office for National Statistics show that household debt in the UK is at a record high, with Britons spending an average of £900 more than they earn each year.

But just how worried should we be about this flurry of depression-inducing stats? Is a lifelong relationship with debt simply the new normal – not just for younger adults, but for the entire population?

Take cars, for example – often the biggest purchase we’ll make after buying (if we’re lucky) a home. This week, Auto Trader predicted that within a decade all new cars will be bought on finance as the way we expect to pay for our motoring changes.

More normal, more expected… more risk

Jeannie Boyle, director and chartered financial planner at EQ Investors, certainly believes there has been a shift in expectation.

“Debt is definitely more normal now – credit cards are more prevalent, and so are zero per cent balance transfers, student loans and pay day lenders,” she says.

“For our grandparents’ generation it was shameful to be in debt. In recent times, student debt and house prices have normalised debt.”

Moira O’Neill, head of personal finance at Interactive Investor, agrees and says the result could be worrying.

“If you’re having to borrow four to five times your income to buy a property, an enormous sum in itself, adding some more debt to that may not seem like such a big deal,” she explains.

“And that is where people are going to get into trouble. Interest rates have been very low for many years and people with big mortgages or other debts should be aware that they need to factor in a cushion for when rates rise.”

Perhaps understandably, commentators from the finance industry seem confident. Brian Brodie, chief executive of the loans agency Freedom Finance, says: “Debt isn’t a dirty word. Whether financing home improvements or purchasing a new car, taking out a loan is no longer seen as the ‘last resort’.

“Low interest rates have driven many people to lock their savings away in fixed-term accounts that offer higher returns, but reduced access to savings. As a result, ‘middle class’ borrowing is on the rise. In the last six months, around half of our new loans were taken out by customers with an ‘excellent’ credit rating.”

For Richard Haymes, head of financial difficulties at Equifax company TDX Group,​ this expectation of a lifetime of debt is a clear concern. He says: “With inflation hitting a six-month high in August (2.7 per cent), a recent interest rate rise and limited wage growth, it’s disconcerting that a large proportion of people are taking on debt without a realistic expectation of being able to pay it back.

“According to our analysis, personal insolvencies are set to grow by 17 per cent this year, and the main contributing factor is record levels of consumer borrowing.”

Lifelong costs

Debt might be manageable while people work and earn but there’s concern about what a lifetime in debt might mean for our old-age wellbeing.

Research carried out by the Centre for Economics and Business Research with equity release specialist More 2 Life shows that unsecured debt among 55- to 74-year-olds has risen by more than a third over the last four years, more than twice as fast as the national average. And the most common form of debt for this age group is credit cards, with 30 per cent spending more than they pay off each month.

Boyle adds: “We’re increasingly seeing people using pension freedoms to pay off debt when they turn 55, which has an impact on their wellbeing in retirement. This is often the only savings they’ve effectively been ‘forced’ to make.

“People also think they will use equity in their property to pay it off later – but this is problematic as downsizing does not always release as much money as expected. Any future drop in property process will exacerbate this.”

WILL YOU THRIVE IN CASHLESS BRITAIN?

Almost 11 million Britons now consider themselves virtually cashless. They pay for almost everything by card or online.

That’s a fifth of the population that doesn’t walk down the street jangling their pockets and can’t remember the last time they counted out coins for a cashier. Many say they feel safer without it.

The Royal Mint halved its coin production rate this year as vast swathes of the population just don’t use “shrapnel” any longer. Last year, debit cards took over from cash as the most common form of payment type and now contactless payments alone account for more transactions than notes and coins. A third of us regularly go out with only a debit or credit card.

Within the next seven years, about 60 per cent of us will become cashless, new research from GoCompare suggests.

They’re not the demographics you’d expect though. In fact, adults in their 40s and 50s are far more likely to embrace contactless payments than the under 25s – almost half of whom pay in cash – says GoCompare.

How cashless are you?

At a time when thousands of ATMs look set to vanish from our streets as the Link network battles to compete with the likes of Visa and Mastercard, separate research also out this week from the Post Office points to Britons remaining tech free in a range of stubbornly cash-based transactions from car-park payments to pocket money.

And as we move towards a seemingly cashless future, stepping lightly along the fintech path without all that shrapnel, concerns are growing about the real impact and risks that a society without physical money brings with it.

There are obvious, well-known worries that millions of Britons are being left behind in the world of financial apps, online banking and contactless payments. A quarter of the population fears for the vulnerable and elderly in an increasingly cashless Britain, the Post Office warns, while another quarter simply doesn’t feel we have the infrastructure in place to transition smoothly.

Elsewhere in the world, the move to a cashless existence is advancing far quicker though.

India has been pursuing a proactive, some say brutal policy of demonetisation since 2016. The country even has its own government department focused on making the country cashless.

The approach, which includes taking certain notes out of circulation, sometimes with very little notice is, the government claims, designed to curtail the shadow economy and destroy the role counterfeit cash plays in organised crime and terrorism.

Critics believe the policy has dented the economy and hit the poorest hard.

In Sweden, perhaps the closest thing there currently is to a cashless society, shops often have “no cash please” signs in their windows. Just 13 per cent of purchases in Swedish shops are now made in cash and yet even here there is a growing movement to back cash.

Trust and faith

In fact, as we ditch cash at increasing rates, major players in the global financial world are trying to put the brakes on.

While Britons faced a summer punctuated by one massive IT failure after another – the latest of which temporarily brought Barclays, RBS and NatWest’s retail banking to their knees only a week ago – a flurry of European central bankers were warning that the move towards a cashless society could bring chaos with it.

In scenarios ranging from power failures to cyberattacks, cash, they note, provides trust and security. When Visa payments failed across the continent in June this year it was often those with cash to hand who were able to manage a range of situations that had suddenly become very sticky indeed.

Now, the strategies being employed by these organisations to deliver robust financial systems are increasingly acknowledging a strong supportive role for cash in the future.

Real money, real spending

On the ground, there are more personal, more immediate issues to deal with though. As fewer of us carry physical cash around, worrying evidence also shows the UK consumer – who already has staggering average levels of personal debt – is losing track of their spending because they’re increasingly dissociated from it.

Georgie Frost, consumer advocate for GoCompare Money, warns: “While the contactless revolution is being driven by the genuine sense of convenience experienced by shoppers, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that there is also a dangerous disassociation between electronic payment methods and spending ‘real money’.

“Our study reports that 17 per cent of contactless users admit to losing track of spending and 13 per cent say they are worried it encourages them to spend more than they should.

“Just as contactless payments are unlikely to mark the end of cash entirely, we need to ensure that old school budgeting, checking statements and reconciling payments doesn’t go out of fashion too.”

HOW TO MAKE IT RIGHT WHEN HELP TO BUY GOES WRONG

“The cheque finally arrived about six weeks after we got the keys,” says Sarah Newick, 28, a very money savvy first-time buyer.

She was an early adopter of the Help To Buy ISA, keen to make use of the government top-up. And she succeeded in buying her first home in her 20s while caring for a new baby.

Yet the flaws in the scheme almost sank her house-buying dream.

Sarah works in the West End as a stagehand but lives in Kent. Buying a home is a challenge for every first-time buyer but in that part of the UK it can be especially demanding. So when the Help To Buy ISA was launched in December 2015, with the promise that the government was ready to add 25 per cent to her savings up to a maximum of £3,000, Sarah was delighted.

In the first month it’s possible to save as much as £1,200, but after that it’s capped at £200 a month, so it takes a while to build up the full bonus.

“When it first came out and we looked into it, it sounded so exciting and like real help. You can get up to £3,000, which was amazing but only if you have the ISA five years – I didn’t want to wait five years to buy.

“I was gutted because my father passed away so I had some inheritance and I wanted to use that and get the help.”

Sarah was pleased to earn the bonus though and encouraged her fiance to save into a Help To Buy account too. Despite having a new baby, they were ready to buy their first home. Then, like thousands of other first-time buyers, they discovered that their Help To Buy ISAs would not pay out until after they had purchased the property.

“It was a heart-dropping moment,” she says. “It was a very quick process buying the place, all really exciting, and then the setback of not being able to get the money was a freakout moment.

“We were just so grateful his parents could help us. If they hadn’t we’d have had to pull out of buying it.”

She’s not alone; research from the financial firm OneFamily has revealed that since 2015 the Help to Buy ISA has delayed an estimated 45,000 property sales because it cannot be used towards the deposit – and many buyers have realised too late.

Better options

Nici Audhlam-Gardiner, managing director of Lifetime ISAs at OneFamily, says: “The Lifetime ISA, introduced last year, is far better for first-time buyers. Not only do savers make more in government bonuses, they can actually use it towards the deposit.

“We support the closure of the Help to Buy ISA next year as it is not fit for purpose and is actually delaying property sales, however our research shows that the majority of first-time buyers remain unaware of the Lifetime ISA. We are urging the government to reiterate its closure plans and further support the Lifetime ISA and help the thousands of people who are desperate to get on the ladder.”

Avoiding the Help To Buy ISA in favour of the more helpful Lifetime ISA is one way would-be buyers can avoid a house-buying pitfall. But there are other stumbling blocks and considerations for new buyers and it’s essential they are aware of them so that an unexpected issue doesn’t derail their plans.

Know your small print

Whether you make use of a Lifetime ISA or a Help To Buy ISA, it’s essential to understand the limitations of the help that’s available. For example, the Lifetime ISA bonus can only be paid out as a deposit on a home worth £450,000 or less.

Ishaan Malhi, CEO and founder of online mortgage broker Trussle, warns: “Many people now opt for the Lifetime ISA, which also offers a government boost. But there are still limits to what you can spend the money on, so think well in advance about where you’ll be buying and save accordingly.”

Get your credit score in order

There are steps that would-be buyers can take to polish up their credit score and doing so alongside making savings is essential. That can include checking for and correcting errors.

Justin Basini, CEO of credit reference agency ClearScore, says: “By far the most common mistake people make is not understanding the impact a credit score has on the mortgage application process.

“A mortgage is probably one of the biggest financial transactions you’ll ever make, so it’s crucial to get yourself into a strong position before you start the application process. Having a low credit score can impact your mortgage application in a big way. It can lead to not getting the deal you want, and, in worse case scenarios, a rejection.

“Often lenders won’t give mortgages to those with poor credit histories. Those lenders that will typically have higher APRs as you’re a riskier borrower.”

Make use of Mum and Dad

One way that parents can provide help is to stand guarantor if they are financially able to – but it’s obviously something they would have to give very careful thought to as if you fell behind on your mortgage repayments they would need to make those payments on your behalf.

Reuben Skelton from Oaksmore ISA, says: “The benefit of this scheme is that the first-time buyer is able to borrow more or put down a smaller deposit. The guarantor will not have any stake in the property, nor will their name appear on any of the title deeds, but they must agree to use either their home or a lump sum of savings as a collateral should they then also fail to keep up repayments.”

Widen your horizons

Mark Homer, cofounder of the property education company Progressive Property, recommends new buyers look for extra ways to add value to a property to stretch their money further.

“This scheme can be used with existing rather than new build property (as it must be with the Help To Buy scheme) so the purchaser is able to buy a property that needs refurbishment, to add value to it and won’t suffer from the new build premium which means the property drops in value when you move into it much like a new car does.

“I would look for a three-bed property that needs a light refurb and mate this product with a Bath Building Society rent-a-room mortgage or similar so you can rent some of the rooms out, which will often cover all of the mortgage payments.”

Sort out the paperwork

A lot of the delay of buying a home can be avoided if you have everything you need ready in advance.

Marc Trup, founder of property management software company Arthur Online, says: “All first-time buyers should ensure a budget is set from the start.

“Legal fees, removal costs, mortgage arrangement fees and stamp duty should all be properly tracked. Without a budget you may find yourself without sufficient funds at the end of the lengthy buying process.

“Buyers should also be prepared to give a full rundown of their monthly expenditure to potential lenders. Expect your lender to look closely at your outgoings, from food and socialising to clothes shopping and commuting costs. This helps lenders form an opinion on your spending habits and will be a determining factor in how much you can borrow.”

Find the right mortgage

Jason Witcombe, chartered financial planner at Progeny Wealth, says: “Focus your energy on your mortgage. Take it seriously as it will probably become your biggest monthly expenditure item. Shop around to get the absolute best deal for you.

“A 0.5 per cent or 1 per cent annual difference in interest rates might sound like nothing, but it’s big money when multiplied by a six figure debt. Take the warnings in the mortgage offer document seriously – interest rates can and will go up. Make sure that you are comfortable that you can manage this before you sign on the dotted line.”

FOUR MONEY MATTERS YOU SHOULD WORRY MORE ABOUT

It’s a worrying time.

Brexit, questionable global leaders, plastic pollution and environmental catastrophe, economic uncertainty.

We don’t need anything else to keep us awake at night.

But over and over again, studies into consumer behaviour show we’re focusing on the wrong things when it comes to managing our money.

So if your time is short and your sense of impending doom high, strip back the sense of general financial fear and take these four steps – this weekend – to start making a real difference.

1. Update your details – at least £1,000

Brits move more than 11 times in the average lifetime. Students often up sticks every year. And millions of us are failing to update our details.

But the consequences could be huge. Swathes of 18-year olds are set to miss out on thousands of pounds worth of children’s savings because the government can’t find them, for example.

This isn’t just about keeping track of your savings though.

Failing to update your details could land you in serious hot water with the DVLA. The wrong address on your driving license makes it invalid, and that brings with it a £1,000 fine. And it’s easy to sort out online.

2. Prioritise the big decisions – £6,400

Don’t beat yourself up. We’re wired for instant gratification as a species, so it almost goes without saying we’ll happily spend time researching things we’ll gain tangible short term benefits from ahead of vaguer but potentially far more valuable decisions.

Data from Legal & General, for example, suggest we spend more time buying a car than deciding how we will manage our money in retirement.

It’s easy to understand why. A shiny new motor versus a jargon-filled discussion about old-age funding? You can almost inhale the new car smell.

A third of the over 55s – those closest to getting their hands on the money they’ve saved all their working lives for, spend more time in showrooms and trawling car auction sites than deciding how they want their pension income.

Shopping around for the best annuity rate could boost their cash in old age as much as 30 per cent, but they’ll still spend more time remodelling their bathroom than securing their future.

With an average retirement pot of around £21,400, the extra income could be the equivalent of adding an extra £6,400 in savings.

3. Move your mortgage – £30,000

Remember those skewed priorities? Consumers spend five days searching for a holiday but only three days choosing a mortgage – roughly the same amount of time as we spend picking an outfit for a big event.

Research from credit report provider Noddle.co.uk reveals one in four homeowners will plump for the first available mortgage, and one in five are now stuck in a financial contract they’re not happy with.

Borrowers could save huge amounts by searching out better deals. In fact, those on standard variable rates (SVR) could save £25,000 in mortgage interest alone, by swapping to an average 10-year fixed rate deal.

A quarter of mortgage borrowers have been on their lender’s SVR for six months or more. That’s around 2 million households which could save £229 in interest every month on the average loan amount just by moving to a typical 10-year deal at 2.73 per cent, according to Private Finance.

Move to the best 10-year rate on the market – currently 2.39 per cent – and the average monthly savings of £278 add up to more than £30,000 over that decade.

4. Claim your benefits – £3,000

The plight of those whose unjust benefits assessments have left them destitute is well known but millions of people are struggling to get by without financial assistance that is rightfully theirs.

As Universal Credit continues to be rolled out across the country, the benefits it will replace are woefully underclaimed.

The last figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions showed around 1.6 million families were each missing out on an average £3,000 in Housing Benefit every year.

Around £2.7bn of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), and £1.6bn in Jobseeker’s Allowance, goes unclaimed every year. And around 40 per cent of those entitled to Pension Credit aren’t taking it – that’s 1.4 million families losing out on a total £3.3bn.

Meanwhile, working parents could save thousands of pounds every year on childcare. For eligible families with a youngest child under 12, the tax-free childcare scheme – which works alongside 30 hours of free childcare – means the government will add £2 for every £8 parents – including the self-employed – pay into their childcare account. It could mean a boost of up to £2,000 per child every year.

Apply online for tax free childcare at Childcare Choices, check your eligibility for universal credit at Citizens Advice, and find out if you’re missing out on benefits you’re entitled to via the government website.

MONEY-SAVING SMART TECH COULD BE ENABLING SMART DOMESTIC ABUSE

“I was in a relationship for eight years that was physically and mentally abusive. I know that now.”

This woman doesn’t want to use her real name, so we’ll call her Melanie. She endured a lengthy marriage with an abusive man who used fast-developing technology to control and monitor her.

He hurt her, he would beat her on parts of the body where it would not show. He alienated her friends, he undermined her confidence. He also tracked her, constantly, using tech originally designed to help make her life easier.

“WhatsApp tells [contacts] when you’re online,” says Melanie. “There’s no way to remove that function, and if you go on for a split second then it shows you on for about 30 seconds. That’s difficult if someone is stalking you, because they think you’re online and [they] want to know what you’re doing.

“The other thing, that’s even more important, is the app Find My Friends. That app is automatically installed on iPhone now … It tells where you are, your exact location.”

The growing tech obsession with connecting everyone and everything has an admirable rationale. It can be extraordinarily convenient and can often save serious amounts of money.

Homes can be fitted with tech that reduces insurance premiums, alerting householders when the front door opens and streaming footage to their phones. Apps can monitor not just how much we spend, but break down what we spend it on. Smart thermostats allow householders to adjust the heating remotely. The internet of things creates many opportunities to save money.

However, as Melanie’s experience has shown, the creators of smart tech are just focused on driving new ways to connect. They are not considering whether it could be enabling “smart abuse”, or taking steps to mitigate it.

Raj Samani is chief scientist and fellow at McAfee. He also volunteers as the Cloud Security Alliance’s innovation officer and as internet security adviser to the European Cybercrime Centre. He is concerned about the level of surveillance people routinely hand partners via access to their tech.

“For the most part, smart home technology makes consumers’ lives easier and more enjoyable,” he says.

“However, as a growing amount of personal information is flowing to and from connected things, security and privacy is paramount. From mobile phones to digital assistants, games consoles to thermostats, connected devices can pose a risk and must be secured to avoid becoming a target.

“One thing people need to remember though: it is not just your stereotypical cybercriminal that could have the ability to exploit smart home technologies. Consumers often trust loved ones within their homes, meaning security can sometimes become an afterthought.

“Partners and ex-partners familiar with a user’s connected device set-up could have the ability to tap into smart home technology and use it to spy on or control them in a whole host of ways. Sadly we’re seeing more and more cases of it, where individuals use technology to manipulate or scare their current partner or exes.”

The rapidly developing issue of smart tech abuse has led to University College London beginning a study into abuse enabled by the internet of things. It has published a resource list for victims of technology-facilitated abuse, as well as for those working with such victims.

The university’s research notes growing awareness of online risks, via websites, but observes the growing interconnectivity of household appliances and security means risks of abuse are rapidly developing. And many of the gadgets and systems we bring into our homes to save money or reduce insurance premiums could enhance those risks.

“While many of these efforts are concerned with ‘conventional’ cyber risks, such as abuses on social media platforms and restrictions to devices such as laptops and phones, emerging internet of things technologies, such as smart meters, locks, and cameras, expand domestic violence victims’ risk trajectories further,” UCL researchers warn.

Charities supporting people who try to escape abusive relationships say they are increasingly aware of this risk developing into domestic control and abuse.

A spokesperson for Women’s Aid said: “It should come as no surprise that perpetrators of domestic violence are now routinely using technology to commit crimes against those they victimise. Domestic abuse has, at its root, a desire for control and to instil fear.

“The potential for technology to achieve both those objectives is clear. As new technologies emerge, so do new opportunities for control and domestic abuse.”

Perhaps legislation is already falling short, failing to ensure apps which track people include safety features. Technology that is already standard has insufficient safety mechanisms, let alone new developments, such as smart locks and cameras.

Melanie says: “There definitely needs to be more legislation to protect people. I just don’t think the government is taking it seriously enough at the moment, and I don’t think the tech companies are either. I don’t think they understand the concerns around privacy.

“Everyone is worried about targeted adverts and so on, but no one is worried about location-based tracking. And that’s really putting some people in danger.”

WHERE YOU LIVE COULD DECIDE YOUR POST-BREXIT FINANCIAL SITUATION

Whichever way you voted in that now infamous referendum, few people either side of the divide question Brexit will fundamentally affect us. That, after all, was the whole point.

As the EU divorce approaches, it’s becoming plain few aspects of our everyday lives will remain untouched.

And when it comes to our finances, heavily spun stories of imminent disaster or rapidly realised gains abound.

The truth about how the split from Brussels will really affect us remains frustratingly obscure. Meanwhile businesses and industries of all sizes, types and structures are ploughing time, money and resources into Brexit-proofing themselves.

Clear as mud

“Predicting which regions are going to fare the best after Brexit is no easy feat. One view might come from the government’s own EU Exit Analysis from January this year, which pointed to the North East, the West Midlands, and Northern Ireland as being the worst affected,” says Mike Smith, director at business insolvency firm Companydebt.com.

“If this is correct, it points to the fact that the very areas of the UK which voted leave in June 2016 are likely to be the ones hardest hit.

“The Midlands, Wales, and the North East are at particular risk due to greater dependency on EU markets for their trade than London, the South-East or Scotland.”

But another quite different view comes from the London School of Economics (LSE). According to its Centre for Economic Performance report – Brexit, Trade and the Economic Impacts on UK Cities – cities with high levels of employment in knowledge-intensive industries will be hit hardest.

“This places the biggest losers in the South East, London and the commuter belt,” Smith adds.

In light of the uncertainty, consumers are being urged to make their personal affairs as robust as possible to ensure they can weather the decoupling storm by paying off debts, building savings, cutting costs and fixing interest rates wherever possible.

But there are many aspects of our money matters that are fundamentally influenced by where and how we live, not least security of income and jobs.

Here’s what your location could mean for your post-Brexit financial future.

Housing

According to KPMG’s latest Economic Outlook Report, the UK economy is set for modest growth if a positive Brexit deal can be reached with the EU. It believes UK GDP will have grown 1.3 per cent this year and 1.4 per cent next year – the lowest rate of growth since 2008 and 2009.

If we crash out with a disorderly Brexit, KPMG predicts a rapid slowing of growth to 0.6 per cent in 2019 and 0.4 per cent in 2020.

This kind of risk and uncertainty will probably make the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee cautious about raising interest rates and we may not see another rise – with its direct impact on the cost of borrowing and savings earnings – until the end of next year at the earliest. Wherever we live, the good news is the cost of mortgages isn’t likely to increase any time soon.

Meanwhile the housing market, which many Brits use as a key measure of national, regional, and personal financial health, looks ripe for a rebalance.

KPMG UK predicts house price growth will slow from 4.5 per cent last year to 2.6 per cent this, 2.0 per cent next year, and 1.6 per cent in 2020. High price levels, uncertainty around the future economic outlook and rising interest rates are expected to take their toll in London and the South East especially. House prices in the capital are expected to fall 0.7 per cent next year.

Across the UK, the housing market’s strongest growth is expected in regions with lower valuation pressures, such as Scotland, where prices could rise 4.9 per cent this year. By comparison, the housing market in London will continue to struggle, with gradual price falls until 2021.

Debt

Whatever happens next, those with the largest savings buffer and lowest levels of debt will fare best. But personal debt has been rising since the 2008-09 financial crisis and is now higher than at any time in modern UK history, according to debt charities.

However the same debt stress isn’t being felt equally across the country. Data from the Office for National Statistics show the proportion of households facing higher levels of “problem” debt – borrowing people struggle to manage or pay off – is highest in the East Midlands, where 7.5 per cent of households struggle. The region is closely followed by London, at 7.3 per cent.

Stoke-on-Trent – a former industrial centre and Brexit heartland – has the highest level of personal insolvency in the country.

At the other end of the debt spectrum, Scotland has the lowest level of problem debt – which is an issue for around 3.3 per cent of households – followed by the England’s South East, at 3.9 per cent.

Work & income

Employers will still have to honour the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage after we leave the EU, but the chances of a pay rise or even a boost to paid overtime any time soon appear unlikely until the dust has settled.

With inflation hitting a surprise six-month high of 2.7 per cent this week, households have had the long squeeze on their spending tighten further. A lot of that is down to the higher cost of goods coming into the country thanks to the low value of the pound, and that isn’t likely to change any time soon either.

Complex analysis at the LSE determined other factors – such as the global oil price – aside, the Brexit vote increased inflation by 1.7 percentage points in the year following the referendum.

Inflation isn’t a problem for consumers if wages grow at the same or a greater rate – but they’re not. Uncertainty among businesses means pay rises are few and far between, so the “real” value of wages is continuing to fall.

Cutting discretionary spending on non-essentials may be the only way to free up extra cash for a while.

In the meantime, there’s the small matter of ensuring your salary keeps coming in.

Assessing the likely effect of a soft, hard or any other type of Brexit on the economy is a quagmire dripping with political agenda and wishful thinking on both sides, but the industries that could be particularly affected by Brexit include financial services, manufacturing, tourism and the automotive industry, all of which have regional focal points.

In London, for example – the UK’s financial services hub – 13 per cent of adults are seriously considering a move overseas in the next two years for work, according to research by ADP.

But the impending departure from Europe is also encouraging businesses to work harder on retaining staff.

Research by the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD) shows, while businesses have already become cautious over recruitment, they also believe the coming few years will bring tougher competition for skilled and senior employees. In response they are “placing greater emphasis on developing existing staff”.

In other words, and regardless of where you live, there may yet be a silver lining around the menacing Brexit cloud none of us voted for.

FINANCIAL CRISIS 10 YEARS ON: WHO ARE THE WINNERS AND LOSERS?

The memory still haunts many.

Facing an incredible $619bn in debt, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008.

The largest failure in history, it was a defining moment in a global financial crash that was already making its presence felt around the world.

On that early autumn day we watched, mesmerised, as the company’s now ex-employees scurried from deceptively robust office buildings clutching the flimsiest of cardboard boxes.

Few of us realised then that we were witnessing the epicentre of an economic earthquake whose rubble still threatens to bury us a decade later.

As the tenth anniversary of that surreal day rolls around, experts across the financial and business industry have been trying to wrestle hard facts and objective measures from the subjective, politically and socially fraught history of the last ten years.

“The financial crisis ... was followed by the deepest recession experienced in the UK, and much of the western world, since the Second World War,” note Jonathan Cribb and Paul Johnson of renowned think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies in a study of the financial fallout so far.

“What has proved most remarkable about the crisis and recession though was not its initial scale but the persistence of its effects. We had got used to the economy, and with it the public finances and household incomes, bouncing back strongly following previous downturns. That has not happened this time.”

So here’s how the financial crisis has, and continues, to affect you.

Income

The nation’s income, measured by GDP, is just 11 per cent higher today than it was at its pre-crisis peak in 2007-08. That means the economy is 16 per cent, or £300bn, smaller than it was projected to have been had it followed it pre-crisis trend.

Why does that matter to you or I? Because the yawning gap is mostly due to dreadful productivity levels, and that hits people in the payslip.

Average real earnings – adjusted to take inflation into account – for employees are 3 per cent below where they were in 2008. But that’s not consistent across different generations.

For those in the twenties or thirties, earnings in 2017 were 5 per cent and 7 per cent lower than in 2008 respectively, while for those aged 60 and over, including those whose income is from their pension, earnings were only 1 per cent lower than in 2008.

“The widening gulf between generations is partly due to government decisions to maintain the triple-lock on pensions, while also bringing in much higher tuition fees,” says Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell.

“What is also alarming to note in the 10 years since the financial crash is the sheer level of debt people of all ages have taken on.

“Low interest rates and relatively easy access to debt mean that households are now, on average, spending more than they earn for the first time since 1988.

“Even in the run up to the financial crisis, with the era of 100 per cent or more mortgages, debt in households was not higher.

“This is coupled with a decline in the amount people are saving, in part due to the low interest rates on offer and in part due to wages failing to keep up with the cost of living, driving more to raid their savings for everyday living.”

In fact, one group – The 10 Years On campaign – has used government data to estimate that the average UK household has missed out by more than £23,000 in disposable income in real terms since the crash. That works out at around £80 a week every week since this time ten years ago.

Property

If there’s a plus side to all this, it’s the cost of borrowing. Today’s mortgage market has significantly improved for borrowers, with tracker rates starting from 0.57 per cent above the Base Rate.

Before the collapse, the top two-year fixed rate mortgages were usually around 5.5 per cent. Today they start below 1.5 per cent.

“The Bank of England Base Rate plummeted in the wake of the demise of Lehman’s, which for some existing borrowers meant monthly payments were more on par with a mobile bill than a mortgage,” says David Hollingworth, mortgage specialist at L&C Mortgages.

“Ten years on, fixed rates, which is the product of choice for the majority of mortgage borrowers, have hit record lows and remain exceptionally cheap.

“To think it has been an easy ride for the mortgage market would be very wide of the mark. The tightening in lender funding saw criteria change rapidly and substantially, something that was only underlined by the tighter regulation that naturally ensued.”

The Mortgage Market Review has since ensured that criteria standards have not simply reverted back to the looser requirements of 2007. That means borrowers will continue to be grilled about their expenditure as well as their income to demonstrate affordability.

Homeowners have had to understand that the headline rate is only one part of selecting the right mortgage deal and that advice on differing lender criteria can play just as big a role in securing a mortgage in today’s market.

But low interest rates mean high mortgage affordability, even if applying for those mortgages is challenging in the extreme. And that affordability boosts the housing market.

The average UK house price fell from a pre-crisis peak of £190,032 in September 2007 to a low of £154,452 in March 2009, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Land Registry.

Since then, it has recovered to £228,384, mostly driven by growth in the South and particularly South East of England.

The Northern Ireland and North East markets are still behind their peak of 2007, for example, and nationwide prices are now still low despite cheap mortgages, high demand and government savings deals like Help to Buy.

Saving & investing

“The scars of the financial crisis can be observed today in the abysmal rates still available on cash savings,” says Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

In September 2008, the average deposit account paid interest of 3.1 per cent, according to Bank of England data. That now stands at 0.43 per cent. Ten thousand pounds held on deposit for the last ten years would now be worth £10,852, or £8,790 if inflation is taken into account.

Meanwhile there has been a huge expansion in the amount of money held in accounts paying no interest, from £48bn in September 2008 to £164bn today.

Cash savers have been one of the great losers from the financial crisis.

But the negative sentiment towards today’s buoyant stock market is further proof that now old wounds are healing slowly for investors too.

“Lehman Brothers’ collapse prompted a fall in global markets including a 4 per cent fall in the FTSE 100 and a 5 per cent fall in the S&P 500,” says Khalaf.

“In four days of frantic trading the UK stock market shed around 10 per cent of its value. By Christmas it had lost almost a quarter of its value and almost six months later £10,000 invested in the FTSE All Share just before Lehman’s collapse was worth just £6,581. This was one of the most dramatic stock market falls in history.”

Clearly banking share prices came under a huge amount of pressure following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. An RBS share is now worth around 90 per cent less than on the day before Lehman’s collapse. It’s not however the worst performing FTSE 100 share over this period. Lonmin, the mining company long since relegated from the blue-chip index, has seen its shares fall 99.8 per cent over this period, turning £10,000 into just £22.30.

Perhaps surprisingly then, if you had invested that £10,000 on the eve of the Lehman’s failure, it would now be worth £14,893, without including dividends, and £21,352 with dividends reinvested.

Even if you happen to invest on the eve of such a catastrophic event, time remains a great healer.

Within the UK stock market, the UK’s mid-caps have beaten the big blue chips over this period, with the FTSE 250 producing a total return of £30,324 compared to £20,026 from the FTSE 100. The small caps have beaten the blue chips too, returning £27,575 over this period.

The list of the best performing FTSE 100 shares since the September 2008 crisis contains some surprising names. Despite markets taking a huge knock, the London Stock Exchange tops the list, as a key provider of the infrastructure that supports share trading – whether that’s buying or selling. Shares in the group have risen by more than 545 per cent since September 2008. Intercontinental Hotels, Next, Experian, Sky and Rolls-Royce are also winners.

14 WAYS TO CUT YOUR ENERGY BILLS

There are still 14 weeks to go until winter officially starts. The nights may be getting longer, the house spiders may be getting braver but the official astronomical winter season begins on the 21 December.

Of course, energy bills are going to start climbing sooner than that because it’s already getting chilly. In many homes the debate about when to turn the heating on is already in full swing.

As well as the cold, many people are seeing their prices begin to rise.

Earlier this week, Bulb Energy announced it was raising prices again, marking the 41st price increase announced by an energy firm this year alone.

A typical annual bill from the company is now £102 extra a year. Whoever your supplier, though, there are ways to seriously cut the cost of energy. With 14 weeks to go until winter, here are 14 ways to bring the bills down.

(Yes, we know that the meteorological season begins on 1 December but then we would only have had 11 ways to save and we felt we could do better.)

1. Compare and switch

This is probably the most common advice for saving money on energy bills but that’s because it’s the easiest way to save a substantial amount.

Switching is simple, can be done online and, according to Ofgem, means average savings of £300 a year.

The price comparison site uSwitch says it could be even more, with some households saving as much as £482 a year by switching.

That’s substantial and easy to do, and then any other savings you make are a bonus.

2. Get used to a cooler indoors

Probably the most frustrating energy saving advice is to turn the thermostat down – a bit like suggesting people save money on food by eating less.

However, rather than turning the heating down, this time of year is a good opportunity to simply avoid turning it up as high as normal and acclimatising to a slightly lower indoor temperature.

If you can avoid cranking up the thermostat the savings can be big. According to the Energy Saving Trust, reducing your heating by just 1°C could cut 10 per cent off your heating bill – typically saving roughly £75 per year.

Of course, that’s only good advice if you can do so safely. It’s generally not considered safe to go lower than 18 degrees.

If you’ve already cut the heating back, or you’re elderly or in poor health then it’s important to look for other ways to save money. Try talking to your energy provider to see if they can help.

3. Be smarter about appliances

Energy use is not just heating, it’s also about the dishwasher, washing machine and tumble dryer if you have them.

Using them efficiently can make a big difference to bills, especially in the winter when it’s well-nigh impossible to dry clothes outside. Running one full load uses less energy than two half loads, for example.

Keeping efficiency in mind can keep bills down.

4. Get some ideas

If you’ve changed to energy saving bulbs and now you’re at a bit of a loss what to do next, then you could seek out some inspiration.

Green Open Homes arranges for people to visit low-carbon, energy efficient properties near them to learn about what’s possible. Find an open home near you here.

5. MOT your property for winter

It’s not just energy bills that can rocket in autumn and winter, the cost of maintaining your house can too. And failure to keep all in order can lead to home insurance claims that then cause your premiums to climb.

Take the time now to ensure your property is winter-ready. Lloyds Bank Home Insurance suggests: “Check the guttering is secure and free of debris and that the drains are not blocked. Inspect any timbers and brickwork to see if anything needs fixing. Check external pipes, taps and hoses and make sure they are drained, turned off and insulated to prevent freezing.”

6. Fit a water-efficient shower head

You may not be thinking about energy bills when you shower but water heating is a major part of the cost.

The Energy Saving Trust suggests that if you have a shower which takes hot water straight from the boiler or tank then fitting a water-efficient shower head can make a big difference.

It says that a household of four could save as much as £75 a year on gas for heating water, not to mention a further £120 on water bills if they have a water meter.

7. Draught-proof your home

New builds can be very energy efficient and well-insulated but most homes lose a lot of warmth through gaps in doors and windows, or through chimneys.

Draught-proofing those gaps is relatively simple and the supplies can be bought in most DIY stores. Doing so can save roughly £20 a year on energy but, best of all, it also makes a home feel cosier so there’s an immediate comfort payoff.

8. Get a home energy check

If you’re in Scotland then you can use the Energy Saving Trust’s free home energy check tool, which highlights ways to save on bills in your specific home.

The service is currently unavailable in England and Wales, however, it’s expected to be back online in the next few weeks.

In the meantime, many councils and local authorities offer free home energy surveys, it’s worth searching online to see what’s available to you.

9. Insulate your loft

Loft insulation is effective for at least 40 years but pays for itself much faster than that. It can cost roughly £500 to have professionally installed but many people can do so themselves for around £100.

Even if you have some insulation in your loft, topping it up to the recommended depth can make a real difference. The depth required depends on the material but it’s usually roughly a third of a metre.

The average saving on bills is around £46 a year, but if you have no insulation at all then it can be as much as £174 a year. Best of all it’s totally passive; once you’ve done the DIY you can just sit back and enjoy the lower heating bills.

10. Talk to your landlord

These kinds of lists can be frustrating for people who rent. Yes, they can switch their energy bills but they may not be in a position to retro-fit their homes with energy saving technology.

However, since April 2016, tenants have had the right to ask landlords for consent to carry out energy efficiency improvements to their privately rented homes and the landlord is not allowed to unreasonably refuse consent.

That’s all well and good but few tenants will want to pay to upgrade someone else’s property. However, working out some easy wins, looking for grants available in the area and highlighting how such work could improve a property’s value might be the incentive a landlord needs to stump up the funds or agree to pay half.

If your landlord is not on board then there are still many ways to save – like these next ones.

11. Move the furniture around

If you have furniture pushed up against the radiators then that can block off the heat. Move sofas and shelving away from them to allow the warmth to circulate better.

12. Don’t heat wasted space

If there is a room in your home that’s not used regularly then turn down the radiator in that particular room and you won’t end up paying to heat an unused space.

Don’t turn it off completely, however, as that can lead to problems with damp.

13. Turn your immersion heater down

The Centre for Sustainable Energy suggests: “If you have an electric immersion heater, turn it down one degree – you won’t notice the difference. But don’t go below 60°C – you need it that hot to kill all harmful bacteria in the tank.”

14. Standby for savings

It’s possible to save as much as £30 a year by turning appliances off rather than onto standby mode, according to analysis from the Energy Saving Trust.

Pretty much all appliances can be turned off at the plug, except of course things that need to remain on such as digital TV recorders. And if you can’t face constantly switching things on and off at the wall then a standby saver allows you to turn it all off in one go.

MPS DEMAND ANSWERS ON FUNERAL POVERTY AS THE COST OF SAYING GOODBYE SOARS

It’s inescapable. Not death itself – although that’s fairly conclusive – but the brutal cost of saying goodbye.

According to the latest data, funeral costs have risen to more than £4,000 nationwide this year. Some studies suggest the bill has soared by a third since 2016.

In London you’ll pay roughly £6,000 for a typical send-off. That’s twice the cost of a funeral in Northern Ireland, says SunLife’s Cost of Dying report.

In fact, most mourners find the final bill – even for the most straightforward of events – typically comes in at approximately £9,000 when taking into account things such paying for refreshments after the service.

Why does it cost so much? Cynics would suggest it’s because we’re a captive market. Brits don’t want to talk about death at all, let alone the cost of it.

So, an attempt to reduce the cost of the final send-off for a loved one is akin to penny-pinching at best, and shockingly disrespectful at worst.

However, when it emerged mourners were being turned away from attending the funeral of their loved ones by at least one local council because they could not pay for it, the issue became so stark that this week questions were being asked about funeral poverty in The House of Commons.

The eye-watering prices, and the speed at which they are rising, have already drawn the attention of the Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA), the body that scrutinises how fairly businesses deal with their customers.

This summer the CMA launched a review of the funeral market designed to investigate the factors affecting cost and whether consumers are getting a good deal.

Fond farewell

Like everything in life it seems a big brand name comes with a price hike. At least according to funeral comparison site, Beyond.

It claims the chains that dominate the UK funeral market are charging 65 per cent more than independent providers, on average.

The leading chains, which make up a third of the market, now charge on average £3,771 for their funeral director services. The same services from an independent funeral director cost an average of £2,287.

The research found that independent funeral directors have actually dropped their fees by 1 per cent since 2016.

“The most disappointing thing about the ‘chain premium’ is how unsurprising it is. Chains have a stranglehold in many areas across the country and it is not always apparent which funeral directors are independents,” says James Dunn, co-founder of Beyond.

“This reduces transparency and makes it even harder for consumers to compare costs.

“Most people would like to know if they are using an independent, local firm and, at around £1,500 cheaper on average, could also save a lot of money. It’s well worth asking funeral directors if they are part of a large chain and it’s crucial consumers shop around.”

Pay less to say goodbye

“Many people worry that having a cheaper funeral is disrespectful,” says Dean Lamble, CEO at SunLife, “but our research shows that the vast majority of us do not want money wasted on a fancy funeral.

“In fact more than one in three people who have recently organised a funeral said they would want their own to be ‘as cheap as possible.’ One in six said they would like a direct cremation and one in 12 said they would prefer a woodland burial.

Beverley Goulbourn, 71, paid around £3,800 for her husband’s funeral, but says she does not want friends and family wasting money on hers.

“I have organised a very basic funeral for myself and paid for it. It has cost me around £1,500. I am not religious and I don’t want all that money wasted on a funeral – I’d rather my family had a good old knees up.”

Safety nets

But what if £1,500 is still, understandably, unaffordable?

The welfare state is supposed to be the safety net between us and destitution, including when we have shuffled off this mortal coil.

In the worst-case scenario, if no-one comes forward to claim a body, the NHS may cover the costs if the person died in its care. But the Public Health Act ultimately places the responsibility for burying or cremating on the local authority.

Akin to Victorian ‘paupers funerals’, such public health funerals have increased by 70 per cent in the past three years according to one recent investigation.

If there is next of kin, those on certain benefits can request financial support from the government to pay for the funeral of a loved one through the Social Fund Funeral Payment scheme.

Eligible claimants who can prove their close relationship with the deceased, and the responsibility for covering the funeral costs, should be able to get help paying for bills including burial plots, cremation costs, paperwork and certificates of death, moving the body and up to £700 for coffins, flowers and funeral directors’ fees.

It’s complex to claim though, and is means-tested so if, for example, the deceased had money in a bank account, even if those assets haven’t yet been released by the bank, they will be taken into account.

The government describes the fund as helping to pay for a simple, lost cost affair. However, in the year to May 2018 almost 26,000 funeral payments were made in the UK with an average payment of only £1,460 – several thousand pounds short of the average cost.

7 ways to reduce funeral costs

1. Have a direct cremation

This is where the body is cremated immediately after death, without a funeral service. The average direct cremation costs £1,835, half the cost of a standard cremation (£3,596) but can cost as little as £1,454 in the North West.

2. Hold a wake at home

Rather than having the expense of hiring a venue (average cost £214), you can save money by holding the wake at home instead. If it’s a nice sunny or dry day, you can also use your garden.

3. Make your own food

If you do hold a wake, you can save money by not hiring a caterer to make the food for you (average cost £348). Get family or friends together and make sandwiches and nibbles to serve instead.

4. Choose a cheaper coffin

Coffins can be an expensive part of the funeral, but there are cheaper options away from the traditional casket. Cardboard coffins start from as little as £100.

5. Don’t embalm the body

Embalming the body is a traditional practice but not essential. You could save around £100 by choosing not to have the body embalmed.

6. Cut back on flowers

Flowers may look nice, but for many they can be seen as an unnecessary expense (average spent is £150) with many now requesting donations be made to a cause or charity close to their heart rather than flowers being bought in their memory.

7. Have fewer pallbearers

To cut back on costs, ask for fewer pallbearers, or even do it yourself by asking friends or relatives to carry the coffin instead. Not only does this save money but it can also add a more personal touch.

HOW GOOGLE CAN BE BAD FOR YOUR FINANCIAL HEALTH

This week marks the 20th anniversary of the day Google was incorporated as a private company and it’s now one of the planet’s best known brands.

More than 80 per cent of internet searches in the UK use Google, according to Jumpshot, and a recent Mozilla report into the health of the internet estimated that 90 per cent of the global market share for search relies on Google.

There’s plenty of debate over how much influence on politics and public opinion this gives the search giant, as well as how much influence one single organisation should have.

But there’s another important issue: the power of Google to affect your personal finances.

Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “It has been 20 years since the birth of Google – the search engine was launched back when we were listening to Britney, watching Titanic, and looking things up in books.

“Since then, a number of other search engines have been fighting for our attention, but most people have got used to ‘Googling’ whatever they want, wherever they are, at any time.”

“It has changed our world, dramatically, not least when it comes to our finances. In many ways, internet search has transformed our money matters for the better.”

“Of course, few things are ever either entirely good or entirely bad, so there are ways in which search engines also make us more vulnerable. It’s why we should be making the most of the positives of search – and protecting ourselves from the potential downsides too.”

The positives are fairly obvious and save most of us an awful lot of money.

Google and other search engines allow customers to shop around for better deals and to find the best prices.

Search engines have prompted many financial services providers to publish guides and easy-to-read information to make themselves rank more highly when people search for information. And it makes it easier to find contact information and company information when we need a response to a financial gripe or query fast.

But the convenience of the internet doesn’t come entirely without risks. Search engines like Google and Bing may simply feel like just part of the internet furniture for many people, but there are still issues they need to be aware of to stay safe and financially healthy.

Finding a great deal from a bad firm

Google and other search engines make it so easy to find the best deal but that can lead to shoppers focusing only on price and not a company’s reliability.

Hargreaves Lansdown recommends doing a bit more research before making any purchase: “When you find a great deal through search, a few minutes checking with authorities like the FCA or Companies House, and Googling the name of the company and the word ‘review’ or ‘complaints’, could save you a great deal of trouble.”

Being followed round by the items you didn’t buy

Google’s algorithm is great for searches but it’s also focused its expertise on making advertising cleverer.

Ad technology via Google and other online platforms can make it more likely you succumb to an impulse purchase, as Vix Leyton, from the podcast Spenditwidely.com, explains: “With ad technology, items that you might really want but have sensibly decided against, haunt you round the internet like a ghost – I’ve given in to this quite often.

“It really puts paid to any notions of leaving it for a few days and if you still remember it then you actually want it.”

Finding wrong information

Primary schools are now teaching kids how to critically assess what information they find online but it’s all too easy to assume that a financial guide or blog is providing accurate information.

That information can be wrong, risking landing you in financial hot water if you’ve taken incorrect or misleading advice and applied it to your own finances.

Charles Brook, partner at insolvency practitioners Poppleton & Appleby, warns: “We have at least two generations of adults who now treat the internet as a primary source material and who make value judgements on the potential quality and value of a product or service based upon its ethereal online presence.”

While googling information can mean you’re much better informed, it’s always a good idea to check financial guidance with a reputable website like the Money Advice Service.

Being hit with a higher price

The price you see in the search results may not always be what you pay at the end.

Paul Went, product and markets director at Shawbrook Bank, says: “Many household consumer brands carry out the practice of ‘teaser’ pricing online where they use Google ads to advertise lower prices to capture attention of online shoppers.

“However, more often than not, customers end up paying more when they actually get to the checkout. We’ve long been a critic of this teaser advertising and believe that retailers and brands should advertise the final price to consumers upfront.

“All too often the process of shopping online for holidays, flights, hotels, train tickets, car hire, tickets to gigs or sporting events and personal loans is difficult, complicated and unexpectedly expensive. Sadly just trying to get what you were promised at the start of the process can feel like a battle.”

Falling into the hands of scammers

Google is actually remarkably clever at pushing scam websites lower down the search results but, depending on what you’re searching for, it’s still all too possible to fall victim to a scam you stumble on through a search.

Hargreaves Lansdown says: “If you go looking for the impossible, you’re not going to find the right answer, but you may well find scammers targeting the hopelessly optimistic. If, for example, something is sold out, it’s tempting to search to see if you can track one down. Scammers know this, and a search may well lead you to their sites.”

It's also a good idea to double check the web address of the site you’ve landed on. Google usually does a good job of prioritising genuine sites in the search results but it’s not infallible.

Just recently Richard Howard was sentenced for breaking consumer protection law. He ran three websites, including one that was found to be misleadingly implying it was the official passport application office. Visitors to the site would pay what they believed to be their passport application fee but the only “service” they received was a booking service, meaning they had to pay twice.

Many people who fell victim to Howard’s website did so because they found him via various search engines and believed the site was the official government page.

It’s all too easy to shop

Thanks to Google and other search engines, it’s possible to move from idly looking up an item to ordering it within a very short period.

Nathan Baranowski, managing director of tech agency Ojo Solutions, says: “Google always being accessible through our devices is damaging to all our financial health because it means we are unconscious consumers, moving through a purchasing process that has lost a lot of its pleasure; products are bought in one click and arrive in an hour.”

Search history can mean the adverts you’re shown are also very targeted, making it even easier to spend.

Rick Smith is managing director of Forbes Burton, a firm that helps businesses in financial difficulties.

He says: “Targeted online advertising, created by cookies and on social media, also creates a constant pressure to buy, especially when products are visually endorsed by celebrities. The targeted advertising and endorsements are often paired with typical marketing slogans of ‘buy now while stocks last’ or ‘sale ends soon’ which results in quick spending and causing strain on financial resources.”

FAMILIES MISS OUT ON KEY PENSIONS RIGHTS LINKED TO CHILD BENEFIT

A campaign to help families with children maximise their state pension benefits this week secured an intervention from the secretary of state for work and pensions – but Esther McVey isn’t planning on changing the rules that mean many families are missing out.

Pension experts have been pushing for reforms to the system since the overhaul of the child benefit rules in 2013. Until then, this benefit was paid universally to families with children, but ministers targeted the payments as they sought austerity savings, introducing tax charges that completely wiped out the benefit for families with earnings of more than £60,000 a year. As a result, many families having children since then haven’t bothered to register for child benefit, not realising that this benefit is closely linked to pension rights.

Crucially, non-working parents looking after children under the age of 12 are entitled to claim national insurance (NI) credits for their time out of employment – but only those registered for child benefit can claim this support. NI credits count towards your NI contributions record, on which your entitlement to a state pension is based; to get a full state pension, you will need at least 35 years’ worth of NI contributions.

The link between child benefit and NI credits means many parents are missing out on the latter simply because they haven’t understood how the system works. Missing a year’s worth of credits potentially means missing out on 1/35th of your state pension – worth around £244 this year. Over a 20-year retirement, that would amount to lost pension of £4,880. For someone taking four years out of work but receiving no NI credits, the total loss would be more than £19,500.

Campaigners such as former pensions minister Steve Webb, who is now policy director at the insurer Royal London, have urged the government to change the system. MPs on the Work and Pensions Committee have also criticised the bureaucracy of the current arrangements, issuing a hard-hitting report earlier this year calling for reform.

However, Ms McVey has so far been reluctant to take action. This week she issued a press release urging families to check their entitlement and to claim NI credits to which they are entitled. But she does not appear to be prepared to change the rules or back-date the claims of families who have missed out.

The stance is particularly disappointing since families can currently back-date claims for missed NI credits by just three months when registering for child benefit. The rule means families who don’t register for the benefit within three months of their child’s birth will lose at least some NI credits – and those taking an extended period our of work but not registering will lose sizeable amounts of pension entitlement with almost no ability to claim retrospectively.

Women are hit disproportionately hard by the system, pension campaigners point out, since they are still more likely than men to take time out of work to look after children. This is especially worrying since women are already more likely to be behind on retirement saving. A study published last month by the insurer Aegon found men are now twice as likely as women to be confident that they will be able to retire comfortably; by contrast, 15 per cent of women have no pension savings at all.

In the absence of reforms to the system, it’s crucial that families understand what they need to do to secure NI credits – ideally as soon as their child is born, but as soon as possible if you already have children for whom you haven’t registered for child benefit.

You can download the child benefit claim form CR2 from the gov.uk government website, though completed forms must then be sent to the Child Benefit Office in Newcastle. This automatically entitles eligible parents for NI credits – but make sure you name the parent who is not working on the claim form, since the benefit is worthless to those who are in work and paying national insurance contributions in the normal way. You can transfer the entitlement in future if your circumstances change.

If you or your partner earn more than £50,000 a year, you’ll need to declare child benefit money you receive on your self-assessment tax return each year. HM Revenue & Customs will then recoup the payments by adjusting your tax position – you lose some of the money if you earn between £50,000 and £60,000, or all of it if you earn more than that.

Alternatively, you can opt not to receive any Child Benefit so that you don’t have to worry about your tax position. Crucially, you’ll still be registered for the benefit, so you’ll be entitled to NI credits – you just won’t receive any payments.

Finally, while you’re checking your child benefit position, it makes sense to review your entitlements to other benefits and tax credits – all families should do the same. The patchwork quilt-like structure of the UK’s benefits system means many families miss out on money they are owed because they fail to claim or don’t understand the system.

On NI credits alone, for example, you may be able to make a claim if you’re looking after any relative under the age of 12, have other caring duties, are receiving Statutory Sick Pay or are married to someone in the armed forces who is serving outside the UK.

More broadly, the Money Advice Service is an excellent source of advice on benefits entitlements and what you need to do to claim. Citizen’s Advice may also be able to help.

WHAT ARE YOUR COMPENSATION RIGHTS WHEN YOUR BANK UNDERGOES A MELTDOWN

Another week, another upgrade, another technical crisis propelling TSB back into the headlines.

Services were out of action on Friday night for a few hours of planned maintenance work but over the weekend some customers complained they couldn’t access their accounts. Some couldn’t log on via the app or mobile banking, others said they could no longer see their accounts.

Good service appears to have now been restored but it was the final straw for TSB CEO Paul Pester.

He had presided over the meltdown in the spring that saw almost two million people lose access to their accounts, with some being shown other people’s banking information and thousands left vulnerable to fraud. This week, he resigned with immediate effect.

The bad news for customers is that many high street banks will need to carry out upgrades; old databases are struggling to cope with the sheer volume of online banking interactions we now carry out.

It’s to be hoped that other banks are able to upgrade their tech as they need to without such widespread disruption to their customers but it’s also a good idea to know your rights if things do go wrong. So what are they?

You shouldn’t be out of pocket

Earlier this year during its prolonged crisis, TSB announced it would waive all overdraft fees and charges for both personal banking customers and small businesses.

Most banks and financial organisations would offer a similar promise if their error had caused the problem. If they didn’t then their customers would be able to raise it with the Financial Ombudsman.

But some account holders may incur indirect costs. For example, they paid a bill late and so were hit with a penalty charge.
