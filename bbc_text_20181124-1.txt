CLIMATE CHANGE: REPORT WARNS OF GROWING IMPACT ON US LIFE

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world

Unchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life, a US government report warns.

"Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today," the 4th National Climate Assessment says.

The report says climate change is "presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth".

The warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda.

Sounding an alarm

By James Cook, Los Angeles correspondent, BBC News

During a blast of icy weather in Washington this week, Donald Trump tweeted, "whatever happened to global warming?"

Now, without mentioning the president, his own scientists have answered their boss's question in comprehensive detail.

Global warming is here in the United States, they say - now. It is already deadly serious and without urgent, dramatic change, it will be catastrophic.

Image copyright EPA Image caption The report warns that the frequency of wildfires could increase if climate change is unchecked

This report is striking for two reasons. First, it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples - overwhelmed dams in South Carolina; failing crops in the parched Great Plains; a rise in insect-borne disease in Florida.

And, secondly, it majors on the economic impact, in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation.

With warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure, falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity, the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life.

The White House said the report - compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments - was inaccurate.

Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was "largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population".

The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity.

What does the report say?

The US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society.

"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states," the report says.

"Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century."

The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events.

But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and "to adapt to the changes that will occur".

What reaction has there been?

Environmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action.

Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, said the report made it clear that climate change was not "some problem in the distant future".

"It's happening right now in every part of the country," she said.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This bar in San Francisco had a climate change message during a summit in the city in September

That view was echoed by Abigail Dillen, president of environmental group Earthjustice.

"While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, his own administration is sounding the alarm," she said.

What does President Trump say about climate change?

In October, President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a "political agenda", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures.

After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels.

At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new "fair" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.

During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was "a hoax". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: "I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference."

How great is the climate threat?

A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could only be stopped if the world made major, and costly, changes.

That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops.

If the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

WHAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change

BBC News looks at what we know and don't know about the Earth's changing climate.

What is climate change?

The planet's climate has constantly been changing over geological time. The global average temperature today is about 15C, though geological evidence suggests it has been much higher and lower in the past.

However, the current period of warming is occurring more rapidly than many past events. Scientists are concerned that the natural fluctuation, or variability, is being overtaken by a rapid human-induced warming that has serious implications for the stability of the planet's climate.

What is the "greenhouse effect"?

The greenhouse effect refers to the way the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the energy from the Sun. Solar energy radiating back out to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions.

The energy that radiates back down to the planet heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder, making our planet hostile to life.

Scientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect with gases released from industry and agriculture (known as emissions), trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. This is commonly referred to as global warming or climate change.

The most important of these greenhouse gases in terms of its contribution to warming is water vapour, but concentrations show little change and it persists in the atmosphere for only a few days.

On the other hand, carbon dioxide (CO2) persists for much longer (it would take hundreds of years for it to return to pre-industrial levels). In addition, there is only so much CO2 that can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.

Most man-made emissions of CO2 are through the burning of fossil fuels, as well as through cutting down carbon-absorbing forests. Other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities, but their overall abundance is small compared with carbon dioxide.

Since the industrial revolution began in 1750, CO2 levels have risen by more than 30% and methane levels have risen more than 140%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is now higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.

Image caption Source: Nasa GISS

What is the evidence for warming?

Temperature records going back to the late 19th Century show that the average temperature of the Earth's surface has increased by about 0.8C (1.4F) in the last 100 years. About 0.6C (1.0F) of this warming occurred in the last three decades.

Satellite data shows an average increase in global sea levels of some 3mm per year in recent decades. A large proportion of the change in sea level is accounted for by the thermal expansion of seawater. As seawater warms up, the molecules become less densely packed, causing an increase in the volume of the ocean.

But the melting of mountain glaciers and the retreat of polar ice sheets are also important contributors. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world and along the Antarctic Peninsula are in retreat. Since 1979, satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice extent, at an annual rate of 4% per decade. In 2012, the ice extent reached a record minimum that was 50% lower than the 1979-2000 average.

The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years; if the entire 2.8 million cu km sheet were to melt, it would raise sea levels by 6m.

Satellite data shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is also losing mass, and a recent study indicated that East Antarctica, which had displayed no clear warming or cooling trend, may also have started to lose mass in the last few years. But scientists are not expecting dramatic changes. In some places, mass may actually increase as warming temperatures drive the production of more snows.

The effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories (or ranges) occupied by animals.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Climate change could cause more extremes of weather

What about the pause?

Some commentators have argued that since 1998, there had been no significant global warming despite ever increasing amounts of carbon dioxide being emitted. This is the so-called "pause" in warming. Scientists have tried to explain this in a number of ways.

These include:

variations in the Sun's energy output

a decline in atmospheric water vapour

greater storage of heat by the oceans.

But there has been no general consensus on the precise mechanism behind the pause.

And it would now seem that the hiatus has come to an abrupt halt: the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 were the three hottest years on record. In fact, a study published in Science journal in June 2015 doubted there had been a warming hiatus in the first place.

How much will temperatures rise in future?

In its 2013 assessment, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecast a range of possible scenarios based on computer modelling. But most simulations indicate that global surface temperature change by the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, relative to 1850.

A threshold of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policy makers have argued that keeping temperature rise to within 1.5C is a safer limit for the world.

An IPCC report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society".

Even if we cut greenhouse gas emissions dramatically now, scientists say the effects will continue because parts of the climate system, particularly large bodies of water and ice, can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. It also takes greenhouse gases decades to be removed from the atmosphere.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world

How will climate change affect us?

The scale of potential impacts is uncertain. The changes could drive freshwater shortages, bring sweeping changes in food production conditions, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms, heat waves and droughts. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.

Scientists forecast more rainfall overall, but say the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. There are, however, likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.

Poorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most.

Plant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.

As an increased amount of CO2 is released into the atmosphere, there is increased uptake of CO2 by the oceans, and this leads to them becoming more acidic. This ongoing process of acidification could pose major problems for the world's coral reefs, as the changes in chemistry prevent corals from forming a calcified skeleton, which is essential for their survival.

Computer models are used to study the dynamics of the Earth's climate and make projections about future temperature change. But these climate models differ on "climate sensitivity" - the amount of warming or cooling that occurs as a particular factor, such as CO2. goes up or down.

Models also differ in the way that they express "climate feedbacks".

Global warming will cause some changes that look likely to create further heating, such as the release of large quantities of the greenhouse gas methane as permafrost (permanently frozen soil found mainly in the Arctic) melts. This is known as a positive climate feedback.

But negative feedbacks exist that could offset warming. Various "reservoirs" on Earth absorb CO2 as part of the carbon cycle - the process through which carbon is exchanged between, for example, the oceans and the land.

The question is: how will these balance out?

TRUMP: CLIMATE CHANGE SCIENTISTS HAVE 'POLITICAL AGENDA'

Image copyright AFP Image caption Donald Trump has said he does believe the climate is changing

US President Donald Trump has accused climate change scientists of having a "political agenda" as he cast doubt on whether humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures.

But Mr Trump also said he no longer believed climate change was a hoax.

The comments, made during an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes, come less than a week after climate scientists issued a final call to halt rising temperatures.

The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced.

Last week's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - warned the world was heading towards a temperature rise of 3C.

Scientists say that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity - which has caused approximately 1C of global warming above pre-industrial levels.

The report said keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society".

Climate change was just one issue touched on during the wide-ranging interview, during which Mr Trump also:

Said that "the day before" he took office the US had been on the verge of "going to war with North Korea"

Said Russian President Vladimir Putin was "probably" involved in assassinations but added, "I rely on them, it's not in our country"

Said Russia had meddled in the 2016 elections but added, "I think China meddled also"

Refused to say whether he would reinstate the migrant child separation policy but added "there have to be consequences" for entering the US illegally

Said he believed he had treated Christine Blasey Ford with "respect" after mocking her testimony in front of thousands at a rally, and that "had I not made that speech, we would not have won"

What did Trump say about climate change?

During Sunday's interview, Mr Trump cast doubt on making any changes, saying the scientists "have a very big political agenda".

"I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference," he told journalist Lesley Stahl.

"But I don't know that it's manmade. I will say this. I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs. I don't want to be put at a disadvantage."

Mr Trump added that temperatures "could very well go back" - although he did not say how.

What did Trump say before?

He said climate change was a hoax during his election campaign in 2016 but has generally avoided taking a clear stance on the issue since taking office.

However, he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels and "endeavour to limit" them even more, to 1.5C.

At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new "fair" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.

It sparked speculation that the former reality television star still believed climate change had been invented.

However, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, later said Mr Trump "believes the climate is changing and he believes pollutants are part of the equation".

How great is the climate threat?

The report released last week by the IPCC says climate change can only be stopped if the world makes major, and costly, changes.

That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7m square miles) for land energy crops.

Renewable energy creates jobs, too

By Roger Harrabin BBC Environment Analyst

President Trump's views on climate change have swung widely - like his comments on many issues.

Vanishingly few informed scientists now disagree that humans have been driving recent climate change, and that further heating will create serious risks for the climate.

They don't expect the climate will materially cool again in a natural cycle.

The president says he doesn't want to spend trillions of dollars and lose millions of jobs by cutting emissions.

Of course he doesn't - but all governments feel the same way. Instead, they are trying to reframe the huge investment needed in renewable energy as a money-making enterprise.

The UK's Industrial Strategy, for instance, sets out to create jobs in clean industries to replace those lost in dirty factories.

And in the US itself, the solar industry is creating far more jobs than the coal sector. Does the president know that?

CLIMATE CHANGE: WARMING GAS CONCENTRATIONS AT NEW RECORD HIGH

Image copyright SerrNovik Image caption Coal fired plants such as this one in Arizona are a significant source of carbon emissions

Concentrations of key gases in the atmosphere that are driving up global temperatures reached a new high in 2017.

In their annual greenhouse gas bulletin, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says there is no sign of reversal in this rising trend.

Carbon dioxide levels reached 405 parts per million (ppm) in 2017, a level not seen in 3-5 million years.

Researchers also note the resurgence of a banned gas called CFC-11.

What are concentrations?

Concentrations differ from emissions in that they represent what remains in the atmosphere after some of the gases are absorbed by the seas, land and trees.

Since 1990 the warming impact of these long lived gases on the climate has increased by 41%.

How does the latest data compare to previous years?

2017 continues the rise in concentrations of CO2 which are now 46% greater than the levels in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution.

The increase from 2016 to 2017 was smaller than the rise from 2015 to 2016, but is close to the average growth rate seen over the last decade.

The scientists at the WMO believe that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere right now hasn't been seen in a long, long time.

"The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now," said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Renewable energy will need to increase rapidly to help the world move away from carbon energy

Why did CO2 concentrations not rise as fast in 2017?

That's because of the impact of El Niño, the naturally occurring weather phenomenon which peaked in 2015 and 2016. This triggered droughts in some parts of the world, which in turn reduced the ability of forests and vegetation in these areas to soak up CO2, hence more of it stayed in the atmosphere.

Does that lower rise mean that some progress is being made?

Not so much. Scientists are very worried that when they measure the chemistry of the atmosphere they find that things are still going in the wrong direction.

"I am very concerned that the three greenhouse gases most responsible for climate change (CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide) are all rising upwards unabated," said Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the University of East Anglia.

"CO2 concentrations are now well above 400ppm - levels were 321ppm when I was born, that is a big rise in a human lifetime!"

What about this mysterious CFC-11 gas?

There have been a number of reports about CFC-11, a gas that's used in home insulation. Unfortunately, production is a real double whammy for the environment, damaging the ozone layer while also contributing to global warming.

Image copyright NASA/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption The ozone hole over Antarctica in the year 2000

Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the global agreement to protect the ozone layer, CFC-11 was supposed to be phased out of production.

Instead researchers have seen a marked slowdown in reductions in the level of this gas, indicating that someone, somewhere is making new batches.

Earlier this year, the Environmental Investigation Agency traced CFC-11 production to a number of factories across China.

Scientists in the field are worried that the detected levels of this mysterious chemical may be a harbinger of worse things to come.

"It's possible that the new emissions are the tip of the iceberg," said Dr Matt Rigby, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Bristol.

"If the signals we've seen are due to CFC-11 released during the manufacture of products such as foams, there could be much more that has been locked up in these new materials, which will ultimately be released to the atmosphere over the coming decades."

What about methane and nitrous oxide?

The news on these two gases is not good either. Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, and about 60% of it in the atmosphere comes from human activities like cattle farming, rice cultivation and fossil fuel extraction.

Levels in the atmosphere are now about 1,859 parts per billion - 257% of what they were before the industrial revolution, and the rate of increase is pretty constant over the last decade.

Nitrous oxide comes from natural and human sources including fertiliser use and industry. It's now about 122% of pre-industrial levels.

What are the implications of all these rises?

Essentially, they underline the fact that there is no sign in the atmosphere that efforts to cut greenhouse gases are having any success.

The report also highlights the fact that these gases can impact our climate for centuries after they have been emitted.

"CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer," said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova.

"There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere.

"Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Climate change is likely to increase wildfire impacts

Will this new study have any impact?

The scientists behind it certainly hope so. They believe that their analysis needs to be seen alongside the recent IPCC 1.5C report which warned that the world needed to be essentially carbon neutral by 2050.

The WMO bulletin comes out just a week or so before climate negotiators begin at the COP24 meeting in Katowice, Poland, where countries will discuss putting the Paris climate agreement into practice and increasing their ambitions when it comes to cutting warming gases.

"The new IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C shows that deep and rapid reductions of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will be needed in all sectors of society and the economy," said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee.

"The WMO greenhouse gas bulletin, showing a continuing rising trend in concentrations of greenhouse gases, underlines just how urgent these emissions reductions are."

BREXIT: MAY HEADS TO BRUSSELS ON EVE OF CRUCIAL EU SUMMIT

Image copyright EPA Image caption Theresa May is facing obstacles to her Brexit plan at home and in Europe

Theresa May is heading to Brussels later ahead of a critical EU summit to formally sign off the Brexit deal.

The prime minister will hold talks with top EU officials, before leaders of all 28 countries meet to endorse the agreement on Sunday.

However, Spain has said it will not attend unless a last-minute spat over Gibraltar is sorted out.

Even if the EU approves the deal, Mrs May must still persuade enough MPs to support it which could prove difficult.

Meanwhile the leader of the DUP - which Mrs May relies on for support in Parliament - will reiterate her opposition of the deal at her party conference later, after threatening to look again at the confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives if it gets through Parliament.

What will happen at the summit?

On Saturday, Mrs May will meet with the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and European Council President Donald Tusk for talks.

Then on Sunday, EU leaders will meet for the special Brexit summit. They will be asked to approve two key Brexit documents:

The political declaration, which sets out what the UK and EU's relationship will be like after Brexit - outlining how things like UK-EU trade and security will work

The EU withdrawal agreement: a 585-page, legally-binding document setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU. It covers the UK's £39bn "divorce bill", citizens' rights and the thorny issue of the Northern Ireland "backstop" - to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What's in the political declaration?

BBC News correspondent Kevin Connolly said some member states are "suspicious of the possibility the UK might be attempting some last-minute negotiations" on Saturday.

There is no formal vote on Sunday but the EU expects to proceed after reaching a consensus.

Why is Spain unhappy?

Spain has raised last-minute objections to how the issue of Gibraltar - a British Overseas Territory with 30,000 residents, 96% whom voted to remain in the EU - has been handled in the Brexit talks so far.

It wants the UK to publish a written statement promising that Spain will be directly consulted on questions relating to Gibraltar during its future trade negotiations with the EU.

On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he will not decide whether to attend Sunday's summit until the assurances are provided.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Sanchez is pro-European and it is not in his nature to scupper EU plans, the BBC's Katya Adler said

Although one country on its own cannot block the withdrawal agreement being approved, there is "no way the EU can rubber stamp a text when an existing member is so strongly opposed", said BBC News' Europe editor Katya Adler.

Gibraltar is believed to be the only outstanding issue ahead of the summit.

France, Denmark and the Netherlands had raised concerns over what the political declaration said about fishing rights in UK waters - but this issue is understood to have been resolved.

What happens after the summit?

If the EU signs off the withdrawal deal, Mrs May will then need to persuade MPs in her own Parliament to back it.

A vote in Parliament is expected to happen in December.

Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the DUP have all said they will vote against the government's deal.

Some of Mrs May's own Conservative MPs - the hardline Brexiteers - are also highly critical of the deal and are unlikely to support it, while other Remainer Tory MPs may also vote against it.

If MPs back the deal, it then has to be ratified by the European Parliament.

Once the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 - which will happen with or without a deal - the details of a long-term trade deal will be worked out during a 21-month transition period until December 2020.

But if the deal is defeated, a number of things could happen - including leaving in March without a deal, a second attempt to get the Brexit deal passed, another referendum or a general election.

What does Theresa May say about the deal?

On Friday, the PM said the UK should not hope for a "better deal" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement.

But she declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be "different".

Meanwhile, the Telegraph said it has seen leaked Cabinet papers which suggest the PM is planning to "reframe the Brexit debate around migration" - by planning restrictions on low-skilled migrants coming to the UK - in a bid to attract the support of hard Brexiteers ahead of the House of Commons vote.

Does the DUP's support matter?

Yes. After the 2017 general election, Mrs May's Conservative Party got 318 seats - four short of the number she needed to rule with a majority government.

The DUP formed a confidence and supply agreement with the Tories, promising that its 10 MPs would vote with the government, and therefore enable it to win key votes in Parliament.

The DUP opposes the Brexit deal because of the "backstop" - the last resort back-up plan to make sure a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland never happens.

It will only come into effect if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal. But the backstop would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.

TRUMP ASKS US COURT FOR REVIEW OF TRANSGENDER MILITARY BAN

Image copyright Reuters Image caption People protest President Trump's announcement of plans to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving

President Trump's administration is asking the US Supreme Court to consider its proposed restrictions on transgender military members.

It is requesting that the top court review lower court rulings blocking a military ban on transgender people.

Federal courts have prevented the military from implementing a policy barring some transgender Americans from service.

The administration wants the court to hear the dispute this term.

The president announced on Twitter in 2017 that the country would no longer "accept or allow" transgender Americans to serve in the military, citing "tremendous medical costs and disruption".

The administration has since limited the policy to transgender individuals with a history of gender dysphoria.

Following legal challenges, judges in federal courts in three jurisdictions - Washington state, California, and Washington, DC - have refused to lift injunctions issued against the president's original ban to allow the updated policy to be enforced.

The US government is appealing those decisions.

On Friday, the Trump administration filed petitions to the Supreme Court asking for its "immediate review" of the constitutional challenges to the ban.

"And absent this Court's prompt intervention, it is unlikely that the military will be able to implement its new policy any time soon," it said.

The petitions ask for the top court to consolidate the cases for decision and consider the dispute during its current term, which ends in June or July 2019.

Between 4,000 and 10,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are believed to be transgender. An Obama administration policy change has allowed them to serve in the US military.

The revised policy under the Trump administration says that transgender individuals with a history of gender dysphoria are barred from military service "except under certain limited circumstances".

The new policy approved by President Trump allows current transgender service members with gender dysphoria to continue serving if they were diagnosed after the Obama administration's policy took effect.

People with gender dysphoria experience distress or discomfort as a result of a disparity between a their biological sex (assigned at birth) and what they feel their gender to be.

According to the American Psychiatric Association, not all transgender individuals suffer from gender dysphoria.

SANDRA PARKS: ANTI-GUN STUDENT, 13, KILLED BY STRAY BULLET

Image copyright WDJT Image caption Sandra Parks, 13, was shot dead in her home in Milwaukee

"We are in a state of chaos. In the city in which I live, I hear and see examples of chaos almost every day. Little children are victims of senseless gun violence..."

Two years ago, 11-year-old Milwaukee schoolgirl Sandra Parks wrote these words in an award-winning essay about the murders in her city.

On Monday night, aged 13, she was shot by a stray bullet fired into her home.

Her frantic family called 911, but Sandra died at the scene.

The girl's mother, Bernice Parks, told police she had gone to bed early while her children watched TV. She woke to the sound of gunshots shortly before 20:00, and found her daughter bleeding on the floor.

"She said, 'Momma, I'm shot. Call the police,'" Ms Parks told TV station WITI. "I looked at her. She didn't cry. She wasn't hollering. She was just so peaceful... She didn't deserve to leave this world like that."

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett described the situation as "insanity", telling reporters: "Tragically, her death was caused by someone who just decided they were going to shoot bullets into her house, and she's dead. A 13-year-old, on Thanksgiving week, on a school night, in her bedroom, and she died."

Mr Barrett speculated that the shooter may have wanted to "settle a score, express anger, try to scare someone", saying on Tuesday: "All we know is that a 13-year-old died last night in her bedroom."

Midwestern paper the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that one suspect, Isaac D. Barnes, has been charged with homicide and a second man, Untrell Oden, faces two counts for allegedly helping to safeguard two guns.

Mr Barnes' ex-girlfriend reportedly flagged his possible involvement to a police officer at the scene. She said he had approached her parked car on a nearby street carrying an assault-style rifle and wearing a mask.

She said he swore at her and told her "you lucky the kids are in the car. I was gonna fan you down."

Police found Mr Barnes in a nearby home, hiding in a closet.

Milwaukee's murder rate has been falling since a spike between 2014 and 2015, but the city still ranks among America's most deadly, FBI figures show.

'She was everything this world is not'

Sandra was a student at Keefe Avenue School, and her essay - which she called "Our Truth" - had won third place in the Milwaukee Public Schools' yearly Martin Luther King Jr. essay contest.

She spoke to Wisconsin Public Radio in January 2017, saying she yearned to "stop all the violence and... negativity that's going on".

"All you hear about is somebody dying and somebody getting shot. People do not just think about whose father or son or granddaughter or grandson was just killed," she said.

Ms Parks told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel her daughter was "everything this world is not".

"My baby was not violent. My baby did not like violence," she said. "Everybody she knew, everybody that came past, she made them happy."

Milwaukee Public Schools said Sandra is the seventh child at a district school to be murdered in 2018.

At a vigil outside her home on Tuesday night, her grieving mother acknowledged that grim toll.

"I understand that there was a lot of kids that passed away recently and I wouldn't say that my baby was better than the rest," she said.

"But God, Jesus, Lord have mercy...

"Lord have mercy knows, she was a star that was trying to get out, but she didn't know how."

Thanksgiving Day violence

In Alabama on Thursday, one person was killed and two injured following a shooting at mall on the evening prior to Black Friday shopping. Police said a fight between two people, believed to be adults, led to an exchange of gunfire.

In Indiana, three people were killed and two injured in a Thursday night shooting at a private home. Police responded to a call at the home around 10:25pm local time. Two men and one woman were killed and two men were injured and are in critical condition.

In Florida, police shot and wounded an unarmed teenage boy while responding to a domestic disturbance call. Authorities say the 15-year-old was shot in the lower torso during a struggle with four police officers. The boy is reported to be in a stable condition.

FRANCE FUEL PROTESTS: MAN WITH GRENADE DEMANDS MACRON MEETING

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Thousands march in France over diesel tax

A man armed with a grenade demanding protesters be given an audience with French President Emmanuel Macron has been arrested in western France.

The man, who was wearing a yellow jacket like the hi-visibility jackets worn by protesters, surrendered after several hours' negotiation in Angers.

The incident comes as Paris readies itself for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters taking part in a second weekend of demonstrations.

They are protesting at fuel prices.

Much of the anger is directed towards President Emmanuel Macron, who is accused of being out of touch.

What happened in Angers?

Police were first alerted to the incident at about 16:45 local time (15:45 GMT) on Friday, with the man finally surrendering just before 22:30.

According to local police, the 45-year-old was holding a grenade in his hands, demanding "the yellow vests be received at the Élysée" Palace, the president's official residence in Paris.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The man was in a car park in Angers

The man had spent the afternoon with a group of protesters who had gathered near the Espace Anjou shopping centre, local official Bernard Gonzalez said, according to news agency AFP.

The explosive device, which is currently being inspected by experts, was "not fake", Mr Gonzalez added, saying "there was real risk" to those around him.

The protesters have distanced themselves from the unidentified man.

What's happening on Saturday?

A smaller number of protesters wearing yellow jackets - giving the movement its name, "gilet jaune" - have been setting up road blocks around the country since the main demonstrations last weekend.

But the number of protesters is expected to rise again on Saturday, with Paris bracing itself for the arrival of people from all over France by train and coach.

Reuters news agency says as many as 30,000 are expected in the capital, with other protests expected elsewhere.

About 3,000 police officers have been brought in to work in Paris alone - dealing not just with the yellow jacket protest, but also another against sexual violence, as well as football and rugby matches.

Feeling ignored

by Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris

This is a protest from the social media age, which means there are no real leaders, no real demands, and no-one is quite sure how many will turn up or where in Paris.

They've been offered rallying-points by the Eiffel Tower and in two big squares in the east of Paris, but there are fears that without any focus, the protesters could break up into myriad small groups - much harder to manage especially if, as is far from impossible, trouble-makers try to join their ranks.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Smaller groups of protesters have gathered throughout the week

The protest may be amorphous, but the anger is real enough.

Its heartland is what's become known here as the France of the periphery: that is, the thousands of small towns across the country where people depend heavily on cars to get to work and to shop - and feel their values are ignored by the sophisticated rule makers of the capital.

Why are drivers on the warpath?

The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of €1.51 (£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s, AFP reports.

World oil prices did rise before falling back again but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel.

The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw.

The president has blamed world oil prices for three-quarters of the price rise. He also said more tax on fossil fuels was needed to fund renewable energy investments.

What happened last weekend?

Some 280,000 people took part in protests at more than 2,000 locations across France on Saturday, with demonstrations spilling over into Sunday.

The protests left two dead and more than 600 injured, according to the interior ministry.

At least 50 people were also arrested, although most of the protests took place without incident.

Several of the injuries came when drivers tried to force their way through protesters.

Chantal Mazet, 63, was killed in the south-eastern Savoy region when a driver who was taking her daughter to hospital panicked at being blocked by about 50 demonstrators, who were striking the roof of her vehicle, and drove into them.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The protests spilled over into a second day

The driver has been charged with manslaughter and released on bail, prosecutors said.

About 3,500 people stayed out on Saturday in what Interior Minister Christophe Castaner called a "restive" night.

In Paris, protesters approaching the Élysée Palace were repelled with tear gas.

RAED FARES: SYRIA RADIO HOST SHOT DEAD IN IDLIB

Image caption Raed Fares' radio station defied threats from jihadist groups and resisted orders to stop playing music

A prominent Syrian radio journalist has been shot dead by gunmen in the rebel-held Syrian province of Idlib.

Raed Fares, a well-known Syrian activist, was killed in the north-western town of Kafranbel.

It was not the first time the founder of Radio Fresh, an independent radio station broadcasting from inside opposition-held areas in the country, had been targeted.

His activism had earned the ire of both militants and the Syrian government.

Four years ago, two gunmen for the Islamic State (IS) militant group shattered several bones and punctured his lung in a failed attempt to silence Fares.

More attempts on his life would follow and yet the former estate agent was determined to carry on.

"He was very much aware that he should not expect to die quietly in his bed," French journalist Nicolas Henin told the BBC.

Henin, who described Fares as "one of the most impressive leaders of the Syrian revolution", explained that even with the constant threats, his friend had refused to carry a weapon.

"It was nothing for himself and because his fight was just dedicated to the people, and to the welfare of all groups, all society," he said.

"I think he believed that that was his best protection."

Defiance

It was not just Fares the militants took issue with. The radio station - with its music and female presenters - also angered the groups which overran the town and surrounding area.

Four years ago, when IS had a presence in Idlib province, the station's office was raided by militants. In 2016, Fares was detained by the Nusra Front, the former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria.

The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham alliance (HTS), which currently controls most of Idlib province, had ordered Radio Fresh to stop broadcasting music.

Skip Twitter post by @FADELABDULGHANY A new tragedy is added to our long tragic record, tens of times I’ve asked him to leave after he was targeted for the first time and then a second time, and now the third brutal terroristic targeting he has been killed. He was stubborn and dismissive, he would simply answer; pic.twitter.com/edymFcBIkC — Fadel Abdul Ghany (@FADELABDULGHANY) November 23, 2018 Report

The station's response was to play long sequences of other sounds, such as tweeting birds, clucking chickens and bleating goats.

"They tried to force us to stop playing music on air," Fares told the BBC in 2017. "So we started to play animals in the background as a kind of sarcastic gesture against them."

Later, the station began to introduce further defiant sounds including bongs from London's Big Ben clock, ticking sounds, ringing explosions and chanting football fans.

Another group, the now-dissolved Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, once instructed the radio station to take women off the air. Instead of complying, Fares told the BBC's Mike Thomson about his creative solution to get round the issue.

"We simply put their voices through a computer software programme which makes them sound like men," he said.

'Let them kill me'

But, despite these battles, Fares never forgot the reason he had first gone out on to the streets back in 2011.

Up until the end, he remained a vocal critic of President Bashar al-Assad, the man who has clung to power through seven years of civil war.

In his final Facebook post, Fares described a protest in Kafranbel on 5 October calling for the end of Mr Assad's reign.

"The people of Kafranbel are in Huriyah [Freedom] Square and voices are chanting: The people want the downfall of the regime. We started this in 2011 and we are continuing on. Our loyalty to the martyrs and detainees has increased our determination."

In the end, he did not live to see the end of the war. Radio Fresh's Facebook page posted a graphic photo of Fares' body on 23 November, along with an image of the body of Hammoud Juneid, another activist who was shot dead.

Dozens of people gathered for their funerals the same day as news of his death began to filter out to the wider world, leading to an outpouring of grief on social media from activists and international journalists.

Among the tributes was one from Fadel Abdul Ghany, founder and chairman of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, who revealed he had asked Fares to leave.

Fares, however, was not to be moved.

"What can they do? Kill me?" he asked. "Well let them kill me. I'm not going to leave and leave them the country."

BRITISH ARMY CHIEF: RUSSIA 'FAR BIGGER THREAT THAN IS'

Image copyright EPA Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied allegations Russia was behind the Salisbury spy poisoning

Russia is now a "far greater threat" to the UK's national security than the Islamic State group, the head of the British army has said.

In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, General Mark Carleton-Smith said Britain "cannot be complacent about the threat Russia poses".

"The Russians seek to exploit vulnerability and weakness wherever they detect it," he said.

The UK blames Russia for the Salisbury poisoning and several cyber-attacks.

In March, former Russian spy Sergei Skripal - who sold secrets to MI6 - and his daughter Yulia survived being poisoned with Novichok.

Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital.

And in October, the UK government accused Russia's GRU military intelligence service of being behind four high-profile cyber-attacks on targets including the US Democratic Party and a small TV network in Britain.

Russia denies any involvement in the Skripal poisoning and has described cyber-attack accusations as a "rich fantasy".

Image copyright EPA/ Yulia Skripal/Facebook Image caption Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found unconscious

In his first interview since being appointed Chief of the General Staff in June, Gen Carleton-Smith said Russia is "indisputably" a bigger threat than Islamic terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and IS.

"Russia has embarked on a systematic effort to explore and exploit Western vulnerabilities, particularly in some of the non-traditional areas of cyber, space, undersea warfare," he said.

"We cannot be complacent about the threat Russia poses or leave it uncontested."

The 54-year-old former SAS commander graduated from Sandhurst military academy in the final years of the Cold War.

He led the search for Osama bin Laden following the 9/11 terror attacks and was at the forefront of Britain's role in the campaign to combat IS in Iraq and Syria.

Image copyright Crown Copyright 2016 Image caption Gen Carleton-Smith said the physical manifestation of the Islamist threat has diminished

Russia has previously been condemned by world leaders over its annexation of Crimea and role in the conflict in Ukraine.

Moscow has also been accused of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election - which President Vladimir Putin and other top Russian officials have repeatedly denied.

Image copyright Metropolitan Police Image caption CCTV shows two suspects in the Salisbury poisoning, whom the UK believes are from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU

Mr Putin also refutes the UK's allegations that the two suspects in the Skripal poisoning were GRU operatives.

Russia has accused the British authorities of Russophobia, misleading the international community and UK citizens and of "disgusting anti-Russian hysteria".

BRAZIL REPLACES LEAVING CUBAN DOCTORS - HEALTH MINISTRY

Image copyright AFP Image caption The first group of Cuban doctors arrived back in Havana on Friday

Brazil's health ministry says it has filled almost all of the vacancies left by thousands of Cuban doctors who returned to their home country.

Cuba pulled the doctors out of Brazil after what it called "contemptuous" remarks by president-elect Jair Bolsonaro.

The far-right leader had questioned the doctors' qualifications.

He accused Cuba's communist government of keeping 75% of their pay, and of not allowing their families to join them.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Cuban doctor Rosa Elena Soto (centre) returned after working for two years in a small town in Brazil

The first group of Cuban doctors to leave was greeted in Havana by the country's deputy health minister on Friday.

The health ministry said in a statement that it had managed to fill 92% of the resulting vacancies with Brazilian doctors.

The statement said more than 17,500 doctors had already been signed up, while almost 8,000 had been allocated to specific areas.

But a large proportion of the Cuban doctors worked in poor, rural parts of Brazil, where it was harder to recruit Brazilian doctors, and it is not clear how many of the new recruits will be prepared to go to those areas.

Why were so many Cuban doctors in Brazil?

Healthcare is Cuba's most lucrative export. The "More Doctors" aid programme operates in 67 countries, and makes the island $11bn a year.

Around 8,000 Cuban doctors have been working in Brazil's remotest areas under the scheme.

Cuba has said they will all be summoned home by the end of December. However, a Brazilian diplomatic source told AFP that 2,000 will likely stay put due to personal ties.

Brazilian mayors have warned that up to 30 million people are facing a care crisis - many in areas where local doctors refuse to go.

TAIWAN SAME-SEX VOTE: POLLS OPEN IN ELECTIONS

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wang Tien-ming and Ho Hsiang have been together for 33 years

Taiwan is voting in a referendum on whether to become the first place in Asia to legalise gay marriage.

The top court ruled in favour of same-sex marriage, giving parliament two years to amend laws or pass new ones.

But surveys last week suggest the country will vote against the change.

The issue is one of 10 voters are being asked to consider, including one inflaming tensions with China: how they want to be called at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Taiwan or Chinese Taipei.

Currently, Taiwan competes as Chinese Taipei, the name agreed with China in the 1980s.

This is because Taiwan's status is sensitive. The island has been self-ruling since 1949 but China regards it as a breakaway province it will reunite with one day.

The referendums are running alongside local elections. Polls close at 16:00 local time (08:00 GMT), with the first results expected later on Saturday.

What are voters being asked about same-sex marriage?

The issue is actually the subject of two separate referendums on Saturday, which have been put forward by rival groups.

Conservative groups have asked whether marriage should be legally defined as between a man and a woman, while LGBT activists have put forward one for equal marriage rights.

Image copyright AFP Image caption A rally held in support of same-sex marriage was attended by thousands

The two sides have also put other issues to voters, including rival questions on education around LGBT issues in schools.

According to a survey carried out by the Taiwan Public Opinions Foundation, 77% of respondents believe marriage should be legally defined as between a man and a woman.

How much does the vote matter?

The government has said the vote will not affect it bringing in the changes required by the court ruling more than 18 months ago.

But campaigners fear it will mean the eventual legislation will be weaker.

"We hope that love and equality will win," Suki Chung, East Asia campaigner at human rights group Amnesty International told news agency AFP. "However, if the opposite happens then the government must not use the result as cover to water down same-sex marriage proposals."

What do the local elections mean for the ruling party?

Nearly 21,000 candidates are vying for 11,000 elected positions, from mayors to city councillors and township chiefs.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption President Tsai Ing-wen (centre) voted in New Taipei City

Looming over the elections is Taiwan's fraught relationship with China, the BBC's Cindy Sui reports from Taipei.

Since President Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence DPP came to office in 2016, relations have deteriorated.

Beijing has refused to deal with her because she does not recognise an agreement reached between the two sides in 1992 that both sides are part of one China.

And that has heightened military tensions, fuelled a loss of Taiwan's diplomatic allies and hurt the economy, our correspondent says.

LOUISIANA LOTTERY: COUPLE FIND WINNING TICKET WHILE CLEANING

A Louisiana couple have more than a million more reasons to be thankful after finding a winning lottery ticket while cleaning up for Thanksgiving.

Tina Ehrenberg said she found a stack of lottery tickets on her nightstand while she was making sure her home was spick and span prior to receiving family for the American holiday.

One of those tickets won her and her husband a $1.8m (£1.4m) jackpot.

The winning ticket was found about two weeks before it was set to expire.

It was from the 6 June draw and had to be claimed within six months.

"We kept checking the numbers again and again," Harold Ehrenberg told the Louisiana Lottery Corporation.

He said he kept expecting something to go wrong before they were able to officially claim the prize.

The couple are from Mandeville, a small town about 75 miles east of the state capital of Baton Rouge.

They netted $1.3m after state and federal taxes, and say they plan to put the winnings away for retirement.

"We don't have any plans to buy anything crazy or go on any big trips," Ms Ehrenberg said.

Mr Ehrenberg said "the most fun is going to be depositing that cheque".

VOLKSWAGEN WILL RECALL 75,000 CARS OVER SEATBELT FAULT

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Volkswagen said affected customers would be contacted

Volkswagen will recall about 75,000 of its VW Polo and Seat Ibiza and Arona cars after a seatbelt fault was exposed by a Finnish car magazine test drive.

A new fix would be offered to affected UK owners from Monday, VW said.

The test drive in Finland showed that when three passengers were in the back seats and the car turned sharply, the centre-rear seatbelt failed.

VW said the tests were under "exceptional" conditions and had not been replicated or reported elsewhere.

However, consumer group Which questioned why Volkswagen had sold close to 55,000 additional cars with a "potentially lethal fault" since the problem was first identified in May.

An earlier cable tie solution and an "informal recall" was rejected by regulators.

Alex Neill, Which's head of home products and services, said: "The decision not to suspend sales when the problem was discovered has now put substantially more drivers, as well as their passengers, at risk."

Nobody has been injured because of the fault.

The car maker defended its communication of the issue to car dealers and customers as it became aware its fix would not be good enough to satisfy the UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency.

"These specific communications - both of the issue and the relevant steps to take - with all of our affected customers were felt to be more effective than a statement on a website," a VW spokesperson said.

"Given the limited circumstances in which the seatbelt can (in the test conditions) come unbuckled, and the employment of the interim fix and further still the specific warnings provided to users, there is no materially increased risk. It is on that basis that sales continued."

Volkswagen said affected customers would be contacted and could drop their cars off to VW retailers to arrange the fix, free of charge.

VIEWPOINT: 'WHY MOST MEN SHOULD PAY ON FIRST DATES'

Image copyright Anne Rucchetto Image caption Anne believes issues like the gender pay gap should be taken into account

Anne Rucchetto, 27, is a writer living in Toronto, Canada. As part of the BBC's 100 Women series, she writes about why it matters who picks up the bill.

When I first began dating, my mother warned me that there was "no such thing as a free drink".

She would elaborate gravely: "Men will think you owe them something."

I know my mother didn't mean to fill me with dread, but her statement left me troubled each time I met someone new. It took me time to relinquish the sense of obligation I felt to men who covered the cost of my $5 beer - but since then, I've never looked back.

As someone who's been dating since the age of 14, I've spent a lot of time thinking and talking about ways to find a great partner, as well as what behaviours to look for when meeting someone for the first time.

These days finding a date is easier than ever, with apps and online communities for people of every conceivable orientation, identity, and background.

But who should pay for the first date always sparks a spirited conversation.

I used to embrace the logic that for women to be treated as equal to men, we should pay for our own share, and split the bill with our date. To make sure that's never a problem, I've always suggested affordable dating venues - cheap and cheerful restaurants, dive bars, gigs, parks.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Anne argues societal innate inequalities mean that splitting the bill isn't fair

About five years ago my friends and teachers introduced me to ideas that made me question that approach.

I became aware of feminist writers like Gloria Jean Watkins (known by her pen name bell hooks) who made me think about who benefits most from the current structure of society. She and others got me thinking about the way power functions at the every level, including small individual exchanges.

'More expensive lifestyles'

People benefit differently based on the current structure of society, so depending on who we're spending time with, it shouldn't be expected for both parties to pay equal amounts.

Women, on average, earn less than men. Canadian women, on average, earn C$0.69 for every dollar a man makes at work.

This doesn't mean that our cost of living is cheaper - in many cases, it can be more expensive.

Expectations around women's appearances and behaviour have material and personal costs. Women's physical appearances are held to impossibly high standards and a routine subject of ridicule everywhere from the entertainment industry to The White House.

We are expected to be calmer, more attentive, understanding, flexible, and accommodating than men in every area of our lives - in family, work, relationships, and friendships. Meeting these norms is costly - materially and emotionally.

Furthermore, who pays cannot be reduced to an issue of men versus women. We all have different experiences based on our gender, social and economic status, race, citizenship, and more.

Ultimately, equality is not the same as equity. Equality is everyone getting the exact same pair of shoes. Equity is everyone getting a pair of shoes that fits them. In good relationships, people will strive for equity.

Image copyright Anne Rucchetto Image caption Anne has been with her boyfriend Zac for more than a year

When I went on a first date with a man who spent most of the time boasting about his sports car and travels, it confused me when he wanted to split the bill. Curiously, it is often these privileged men that have declared to my friends and I: "I'm a feminist, so we'll split it"

Whether or not men believe women's labour is underpaid, it is. Further, whether or not men agree with women being underpaid, they directly benefit from it.

This isn't to say that men don't work hard or should always pay - when I've been in situations where it is obvious that I have more income than the man I'm dating, I am happy to split or cover the bill.

If I sense that a man correlates his paying for a first date with me "owing" him in some way, I will insist on paying for both of us and shut down any chance of further communication. This kind of primitive thinking shows a lack of perspective, respect, and consent.

'Challenging imbalances'

I have dated both men and women, and funnily enough, anytime I've dated a woman, or gender-diverse person we've ended up competing to pay the bill.

I've been with my partner, Zac, for over a year now. I had a good feeling about him when he told me he loved animals, described his appreciation for his friends, and shared his views about labour rights. He paid for our first date and I paid for our second.

Now, we share expenses based on what we can afford when we go out together or visit each other's homes. This might change in the future, but we've found a balance that works for both of us. Our most important goal is to make sure that both of us feel respected and that neither of us feel underappreciated or taken advantage of.

First dates are one small opportunity to recognise that people in society have different access to resources. If we want to be good company and good partners, challenging power imbalances is an important part of every relationship.

Who pays on a first date doesn't define the terms of the relationship.

As bonds develop, the people involved can work to find terms that suit them. Regardless of the expectations we might have about who should (or shouldn't) pay on a first date, it's always good to be considerate.

PREMATURE OVARIAN FAILURE: 'I MISSED A PERIOD AND HOPED I WAS PREGNANT'

Image copyright Nicole Evans Image caption Nicole, now in her mid-40s, reflects on experiencing early menopause

Nicole Evans was diagnosed with premature menopause at the age of 30. She writes for BBC 100 Women about the shock of infertility and how she has come to terms with the diagnosis.

My periods had been getting lighter for a couple of years, but when I mentioned it to health workers here in my native New Zealand they brushed it off as a natural effect of the pill. When one month I missed a period altogether, I went to the doctor excited that I might be pregnant. I had been married for a year and we had just started talking about having a baby.

But the pregnancy test came back negative. My doctor got blood tests done, and brought me back to explain my hormone levels weren't normal. She referred me to a hormone specialist and I was diagnosed with premature menopause. I didn't know ovaries could stop working at this age - it came as an incredible shock.

Today's feminism tells us we can have it all and we should want it all, on our terms and in our timeframe. But this lie costs us greatly when circumstances interfere with the path we had planned.

Image copyright Nicole Evans Image caption Nicole on her wedding day with her partner

I believe celebrity culture has a lot to answer for when it comes to fertility awareness. When a woman's fertility is, directly or indirectly, erroneously portrayed as something that easily continues into her 50s, signs of problems are easy to overlook. I had no idea that, generally speaking, female fertility starts to decline in your mid 30s.

We decided to go through a donor egg IVF cycle with a wonderful friend and felt very hopeful and expected it to be the answer to all our problems. But we ended up with only one viable embryo to transfer and that didn't lead to a pregnancy. It was extremely upsetting for everyone involved.

A year later another friend offered to help us, but this time I was very hesitant. It would be the last government-funded cycle, and psychologically I felt safer in between treatment. In the midst of fertility treatment it can take a great deal of courage simply to walk out the door each morning.

But we gave the second cycle a go because I was now aged 32. Time was marching on.

What is menopause?

Menopause is the biological stage in a woman's life that occurs when she stops having periods

Periods can become less frequent over months or years before the stop

Other symptoms include hot flushes, poor concentration, headaches, anxiety, reduced sex drive and difficulty sleeping

Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55 - the UK average is 51

About one in every 100 women under the age of 40 go through premature menopause, also known as premature ovarian insufficiency

Source: NHS UK

Sadly the two separate embryo transfers we did from this cycle didn't become pregnancies either, and we didn't have the financial or emotional resources to invest in a third cycle.

I couldn't face adoption. Having just finished being poked and prodded physically, I would then have to start on a journey of more prodding - into our relationship, jobs, home life, finances - as part of a gruelling vetting process. Of course I understood why it was necessary, but I just couldn't face it on top of the trauma I'd already experienced.

I hit rock bottom. The emotional heartache for the loss of our potential children was there no matter how hard we tried to rationalise it away. And this heartache remained for me until one particular evening. I'd spent it with a girlfriend and her newborn, and after she left I noticed that the longing to have a baby of my own was gone. Simply erased.

I couldn't explain it other than I believe God took away the longing deep in my heart. And looking back now I know it's because he had something better planned for me - a closer relationship with him.

A great number of doctors seem to be unaware of premature menopause. I've spoken to many women in the support group I run who, when they tell their doctor their periods have become irregular, are only referred to specialists after a delay, if at all.

I have been on HRT ever since I was diagnosed. I'm very grateful for this treatment because even in your early 40s, as I now am, it's very hard to discuss menopausal hot flushes, moodiness and brain fog with anyone. You feel too embarrassed to say anything because you feel you have to explain yourself to any age group.

It's a nice bonus to be rid of the expense and the hassle of sanitary products each month. But it's taken me a while to recognise silver linings like this.

I believe the ageing-averse, hardship-averse culture of the West hinders us from dealing well with natural life processes. We have become so good at distracting ourselves from hard realities, feeding ourselves comforting lies, that we have a very narrow idea of what makes a truly satisfying life.

Premature menopause may have given me much heartache, but it also uncovered the deception that true satisfaction is found in health and youth and perfection. Our infertility journey was a life crisis and our world had to be rebuilt from the ground up, but it has certainly made us stronger both individually and as a couple.

It taught us many lessons: that our true identity transcends our circumstances; to count our blessings; to have more compassion for others; and to approach life with an open mind, to name a few. We may not have it all, but we have everything we need.

Elsewhere in the country, the majority of girls and women are cut. Now, Sudan's government, with help from international aid, is hoping to put an end to FGM nationwide, by 2030.

It comes as the British Government announces £50m to tackle the issue across the continent. The BBC's Senior Africa Correspondent Anne Soy went to meet some of the people turning their back on the practice and witnessed the change they are bringing to their communities.

JOHN ALLEN CHAU: WHAT WE COULD LEARN FROM REMOTE TRIBES

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John Allen Chau was killed by the Sentinelese tribe

When American John Allen Chau was killed by an endangered tribe in India last week, it brought a renewed focus on some of the world's most isolated people.

Officials in India said Chau was a missionary keen to convert the protected Sentinelese people on the Andaman and Nicobar islands.

But the Sentinelese, who are fearful of outsiders, attacked Chau with bows and arrows.

Advocates for isolated communities, like London-based Survival International, say Chau's killing should act as a reminder that remote tribes need to be protected from the outside world.

And one anthropologist interviewed by the BBC said there was a risk such incidents could make people wrongly assume all tribes lived "nasty, brutish and short" lives.

In fact, experts have highlighted plenty of lessons the developed world could take from remote tribes. Here are just a few.

You can't have peace without equality

Image copyright AFP

The Piaroa people, who number about 14,000, live near the Orinoco River in Amazonas State, Venezuela.

What could we learn from them?

It is possible to live in complete equality - and it can make for a peaceful community.

There's one catch: it involves becoming an anarchist. No government, no state, only the individual and their will to do as they please.

The Piaroa disavow violence, and don't punish children physically. They believe peace is achieved by dismissing concepts of ownership, competition, vanity and greed.

No sports are played, land isn't owned, no-one can order anyone else to work and there's a strong emphasis on learning from other people. Not that there's a deference towards elders - that would make society hierarchical, and would mean not everyone was equal.

The idea of the individual is the most important thing, although that emphasis doesn't foster selfishness. It is up to each individual to choose what they do, how they do it and when they do it, and they do not pass judgment on others' decisions.

In a 1989 essay, American-born professor Joanna Overing writes: "The Piaroa daily express to one another their right to private choice and their right to be free from domination over a wide range of matters, such as residence, work, self development, and even marriage."

Image copyright AFP

And because this is a society of absolute equals, men and women share the same status (not that status is a thing).

Anyone who tries to conform to traditional images of manhood, like the hunter, is subject to pity and is seen to lack self-control.

The idea of maturing into a man does not exist, Prof Overing writes. "Nor do Piaroa young men learn the self-regarding virtues of manhood that would set them as males against females, and, as such, superior to them.

"Each woman is mistress of her own fertility for which she alone is responsible: the community has no legal right to her progeny; nor does her husband if they should divorce."

You've got to find your own melody

Image copyright Gill Conquest / Jerome Lewis

The Bayaka are a group of hunter-gatherers who live in the rainforests of Central Africa.

What could we learn from them?

That you have to find your own place in society.

For the Bayaka, music forms a central part of their identity, and experts say the style they enjoy has even conditioned their behaviour.

"The music that the Bayaka sing are these dense polyphonies, meaning that each member… will be singing a different melody and by combining these you create a song," says Jerome Lewis, an anthropologist who has been studying the group for more than two decades.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Listen: Bayaka women singing in Congo-Brazzaville

He says the way in which each person sings their own melody reflects the great importance the Bayaka place on the individual.

"It trains you to be different and these societies highly value autonomy," he explains. "Once children can walk they are free to decide where they sleep and with whom they associate themselves.

"You don't have the right to ask anybody to do anything for you."

But when there are no leaders, and when everyone is free to be an individual, how do the Bayaka learn to work together? Once again, the answer lies in the music.

"The regular participation in this style of singing was what taught people the ways they would co-ordinate in normal, everyday, life," Mr Lewis explains.

"You have to hold your own melody while other people sing different melodies," he says. "In order to co-operate and be effective together you need to do something different.

"This is an autonomy in which people are very sensitive to the needs of others and to their right to be different."

Modern life, modern bodies

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A Yanomami girl in the Amazon rainforest in Venezuela

The Yanomami, an indigenous tribe living in the rainforests of northern Brazil and southern Venezuela, could help us better understand our own bodies.

What could we learn from them?

Research on the tribe, who were isolated from the outside world until at least the 1950s, has given new insights into how modern life could be changing the make-up of the human body.

A 2015 study examined a number of Yanomami villagers and revealed the most diverse collection of bacteria ever found in people, including some that had never been detected in humans before, scientists said.

They said it showed how modern diets, antibiotics and hygiene could be reducing the range of bacteria in our bodies.

"Perhaps even minimal exposure to modern practices… can result in a drastic loss in bacterial diversity," one of the study's authors, Jose Clemente, told the Toronto Star newspaper at the time.

He added: "With each step in Westernisation, we seem to be losing an amount of diversity."

The study has also added to our understanding of antibiotic resistance.

For years, medical professionals have warned that the overuse of antibiotics is making infections harder to treat by creating drug-resistant superbugs.

This study found that the Yanomami villagers had unique antibiotic-resistant genes, despite the fact they had never taken the drugs before.

It provided further evidence that the bacteria in our bodies can already resist antibiotics even before they have been attacked by them.

Slow down, take it easy

Image copyright Mark Plotkin Image caption Dr Mark Plotkin with a chief from the Sikiyana tribe on the Brazil-Suriname border in October

Dr Mark Plotkin has spent 35 years studying how remote tribes across the Amazon use plants for medicinal purposes.

What could we learn from them?

A slower life is a happier life.

Quite apart from the medical discoveries (Dr Plotkin's limp, which American doctors were unable to help with, was cured by an Amazonian shaman, he says), Dr Plotkin says there is plenty to learn from the lifestyles of isolated communities.

"What we find is that people don't suffer from stress, heart disease, insomnia, and that they spend time with their families.

"We may not be ready to give up our iPhones and iPads and never eat Thai food again, but the life lessons are clear: slow down, don't spend time worrying about things you can't do anything about. I try to live my life along those prescripts."

Dr Plotkin, who heads the Amazon Conservation Team advocacy group, said that while there was plenty that developed countries could learn from simpler lifestyles, he advised caution.

"There is a risk of us over-romanticising them, just as there are risks in accepting Jesus and that you are going to live forever, or in moving to a city and thinking you are going to have two cars and a computer.

"Don't over-romanticise how they live, but learn from it. Just like there are good things you can learn from Western religion.

"But just as we shouldn't over-romanticise indigenous people, we shouldn't demonise missionaries like [John Allen Chau]."

HISTORIC BREXIT SUMMIT: 10 KEY QUESTIONS

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May has a huge Brexit fight inside her own Conservative Party

It will be a significant moment in European history when the EU's 28 leaders meet in Brussels to finalise the UK's withdrawal from the bloc on Sunday.

No member state has ever left the European Union before and this summit - two years and five months after the UK's Brexit referendum - is a culmination of months of tough negotiation. But what will happen and is this really the end?

What are they agreeing on?

There are two documents.

The withdrawal agreement

The so-called divorce part: a 585-page internationally binding legal text that sets out the terms of how the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.

Importantly it also provides for a transition period which begins the same day Britain leaves and lasts until 31 December 2020, although it could be extended to the end of 2022. And it has a "backstop", an arrangement that says if the UK hasn't negotiated a new relationship with the EU by the end of the transition it will stay in the bloc's customs union, to prevent the need for a border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What's in the political declaration?

The political declaration

This is the roadmap for the relationship between the UK and EU after Brexit. Much shorter at 26 pages, and not legally binding, the declaration calls for an "ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic co-operation, law enforcement and criminal justice, foreign policy, security and defence and wider areas of co-operation".

It is long on aspiration but very short on detail.

What do the EU27 think of Brexit?

Although they are usually - but not always - too polite to say so, they all think the UK is making a historic mistake.

The political declaration makes clear, as the EU has said all long since the referendum, that the UK will not have as good a relationship with the EU outside the club than in it. By and large most of them just want Brexit over and done with now, although some countries are concerned about specific issues, such as fishing rights in British waters, and Spain wants more of a say over Gibraltar.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Spain is concerned about Gibraltar's status post-Brexit

More on Brexit:

Why is this important for Theresa May?

Apart from the obvious - getting agreement on the two documents - for Theresa May this is all about momentum. She is hoping that the weight of approval by the EU27, including such big names as German's Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, will convince British politicians this is a very big deal indeed, of international proportions.

So, she's more worried about selling it at home than abroad?

Absolutely - this will be possibly the hardest sell any British politician has had to make since 1945.

Theresa May's deal is loathed by Leavers and Remainers alike. Indeed, rarely can a policy of such historic importance be so unloved by so many.

For Brexiteers the deal keeps the UK far too close to the EU, while Remainers fear the opposite and see the deal as infinitely worse than membership. The question is whether MPs can learn to live with her plans for Brexit, if not love them.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May: "My focus is on getting this deal through"

When will we know if she is successful?

It's thought the big vote in the UK Parliament could come some time in the second week of December.

The numbers don't look good for Theresa May, do they?

It was US President Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ), who said the first rule of politics was to be able to count.

Although there are 650 MPs, for various reasons some of them, like the Speaker, don't vote, so the magic number for victory for Mrs May is 320.

But there are only 315 Conservative MPs and the BBC estimates nearly 60 hardline Brexiteers in the party and 14 Remainers are likely to vote against. She also appears to have lost the support of the 10 MPs from the Northern Ireland party she relies on for big votes, the DUP.

And of course all the opposition parties have said they will vote against it.

Could the deal still go through?

If you look at the numbers above, and how unloved the deal is, it looks unlikely. But it could happen.

Don't forget:

The clock will be ticking on Britain's departure

Businesses will put pressure on MPs to end the uncertainty

MPs know many voters just want them to get on with it

Lots of arm-twisting and persuasion from party managers

Fear of the alternatives to voting yes

What are those alternatives if the deal is voted down?

No-one knows for sure, but here are some of the options:

She tries again a few weeks later, hoping MPs will be so worried about the expected turmoil in the financial markets after a no vote that they change their minds The UK leaves without a deal, which most believe would be catastrophic A second referendum, which many MPs fear would make Britain even more divided than it is already Theresa May or another Conservative leader could try for a different deal Another general election.

A health warning on such predictions: it's important to say that if UK politics are already in uncharted waters, a no vote could send them off the navigational map altogether.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Pro- and anti-Brexit protests in London: Voters remain very divided

Do other politicians feel sorry for Mrs May?

Even her political opponents, which at the moment includes most British politicians, have sympathy for her. Most admire her astonishing resilience and doggedness, even if they think the mess is partly her fault.

And the voters?

Like the politicians, many voters appear to have a sneaking admiration for Mrs May's determination and feel a bit sorry for her, not that pity is necessarily a good look for a politician.

As to what they make of the deal, the opinions polls suggest people don't like it, but that they don't think any other leader could get a better one. But what should perhaps worry Theresa May is that the polls also suggest that if forced to choose, more people would prefer another referendum to accepting her deal.

Could the public mood be changing just as Mrs May hopes to be bringing at least this part of Brexit to an end?

WILL GOMPERTZ REVIEWS THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB STARRING CLAIRE FOY ★★☆☆☆

The omens weren't good.

It was the evening after the heavily advertised nationwide release of The Girl in the Spider's Web: A New Dragon Tattoo Story, and the city centre cinema, where I went to see the film was as empty as a trickster's promise.

Such a pitiful showing would have been a dispiriting sight for the Sony Pictures execs who'd backed the movie to kick-start the stalled Millennium Series franchise. For those who didn't show up, rest easy - you made the right choice.

The fifth film to have been adapted from Stieg Larsson's best-selling Scandi-noir saga is easily the worst of the bunch.

And that's not because it is an adaptation of the fourth book in the series written after Larsson's death by David Lagercrantz (who also ghosted the best sports autobiography in living memory, I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic).

The problem with the film, nominally a psychological thriller, is that it is neither disturbing nor thrilling.

Image copyright Sony Pictures Releasing Image caption The Girl in the Spider's Web is an action-packed film, but lacks dramatic tension

It is a perfectly serviceable but very predictable action movie full of car-chase clichés and video game shoot-outs, powered by a plot that has about as much dramatic tension as a game of garden bowls.

The movie opens with the two young Salander sisters playing chess in their father's draughty and over-the-top eerie cliff-top concrete castle. When they finish the game their sexually abusive dad decides it's his turn to play with them.

Not nice.

Lisbeth hurls herself from a broken balcony into the deep snow below and legs it. Camilla stays.

Image copyright Sony Pictures Releasing Image caption Sylvia Hoeks plays Camilla, who is Lisbeth's sister

Cut to a couple of decades later and Lisbeth (Claire Foy) has moved into an industrial space in town that makes her dad's old place look cosy. Still, it matches her goth-punk aesthetic and cold-as-ice persona, which, in turn, fits with her life as a monosyllabic vigilante intent on dishing out the old electric cattle-prod treatment to an assortment of baddies.

Image copyright Sony Pictures Releasing Image caption From The Queen to punk computer hacker, Claire Foy takes on the role of Lisbeth Salander

She takes on a detective job for a nerdy computer programmer (Stephen Merchant) who has created a nuclear version of Frankenstein's Monster.

"What am I looking for?" she asks.

"The sum of all my sins," replies the bearded Merchant.

It's not a great line in any circumstance, but is beyond limp coming from the mouth of a man who looks like his idea of being naughty is un-tucking his pyjama top.

Anyway, off Lisbeth goes, riding her black Ducatti motorbike with elbows out like wings, into a murky world of deadly Russians, decent Americans, and inscrutable Swedes. She is not entirely alone, as ever she can rely on a little help from a few geeky friends and her old chum and admirer Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason) an investigative journalist.

Image copyright Sony Pictures Releasing Image caption Investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason) is Lisbeth's ally

And that's it really.

The story unfolds as you would imagine with plot twists as surprising as getting a woolly jumper for Christmas.

Claire Foy does a reasonable job in a limited role, which offers precious little opportunity to flesh out her character beyond being a cartoonishly two-dimensional action hero blessed with the tech skills to put her in the running for Employee of the Month at PC World.

Who knows why the film's talented director Fede Álvarez (Don't Breath) has chosen to swap mind games for endless punch-ups and shots of laptop screens.

Image copyright Sony Pictures Releasing Image caption Director Fede Alvarez fails to capture the psychological depth of Larsson's work

It misses the point of Larsson's creation.

What makes the books so compelling, and the original film in which Noomi Rapace played Lisbeth, is the inner psychological drama that determines and informs each protagonist's actions and relationships.

Image copyright The Ronald Grant Archive Image caption Noomi Rapace won critical acclaim for her portrayal of Lisbeth in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but said she was "done" with playing the part

They are complicated, dark stories, populated by damaged and complex characters. They need time to evolve and unfold in their otherworldliness. The Girl in the Spider's Web doesn't allow for any of that. Instead we have yet another car chase to crack on with and an electric cattle prod to wield.

Why have dark and complicated when you can have simple and light?

The Girl in the Spider's Web still has her dragon tattoo but she's lost her soul.

SWISS VOTE ON GOING IT ALONE IN SOVEREIGNTY REFERENDUM

Image caption No campaigners say the proposal is a Trojan horse aimed at weakening human rights

The Swiss love their referendums, but a proposal going to the vote on Sunday on Swiss sovereignty has upset almost the whole of the political spectrum and could affect Swiss relations with the EU and even the United Nations.

Why the fuss?

The main proposal calls for Swiss law to take precedence over international law and treaties. For supporters like Aliki Panayides, it would give voters "the final say on every issue".

She says: "That's all we want: it's us that says what is going on in Switzerland, not a foreign tribunal."

United in opposition are the Swiss government, all major political parties bar one, and a coalition of 120 civil society organisations, from environmental groups to groups which support the elderly, the disabled, or refugees.

"It's a Trojan horse… it's not about saving democracy, it's about weakening fundamental rights in Switzerland," says Andrea Huber.

Image copyright SVP Image caption The Yes campaign's slogan is: "Yes for direct democracy and self-determination"

She believes the proposal could allow voters to unpick dozens of international commitments the Swiss have signed up to, on human rights, the rights of the child, or even on trade.

So will it fail?

There is one political party that supports this proposal, and it is arguably Switzerland's most powerful political force: the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP).

And the People's Party has succeeded before in votes on limiting immigration from the EU and on deporting foreign criminals, although their proposals were not enacted into law as rigorously as the party had hoped.

"What parliament did with them was just nothing," complains party member Aliki Panayides. "They just said 'Oh we can't do that, the EU won't like it'."

What's the EU got to do with it?

Switzerland is not a member of the EU, but it has signed up to much EU policy, including free movement of people and the Schengen open border zone in order to gain access to the single market. Both policies were approved in national referendums in 2005.

When in 2014 the Swiss voted to introduce quotas on immigration from the EU - by the narrowest of margins: 50.33% to 49.67% - Brussels immediately signalled that this would be a violation of freedom of movement likely to put trade relations at risk.

Three years of haggling finally brought a solution the People's Party regards as unacceptably weak: no quotas, but preference given to workers already resident in Switzerland, and only if unemployment reaches particularly high levels.

If Sunday's proposal goes through, supporters believe parliament and government would not be able to adapt the results of a referendum so liberally.

At the same time, the EU has grown tired of the endless bilateral negotiations with Switzerland: it wants an "institutional framework agreement" in which the Swiss adopt many EU laws automatically. If Sunday's proposal is passed, that idea could be dead, and Swiss-EU relations could get awkward again.

Why is vote about Europe's courts?

Supporters also see a yes vote as a first step towards withdrawing Switzerland from the European Convention on Human Rights. That would mean no longer being subject to the European Court of Human Rights, which is entirely separate from the EU.

Image caption Andrea Huber says the Yes campaign has misrepresented the reality of the European Court of Human Rights

"Switzerland is a neutral, peaceful country," argues Aliki Panayides. "We don't need treaties for that, we will follow the rules anyway."

Andrea Huber begs to differ. She says thousands of Swiss families were helped by a 2014 ruling from Strasbourg that overturned a Swiss court judgement on asbestos-related illness.

The EU's Court of Justice is also a factor.

If the Swiss government agrees the "institutional framework agreement", the ECJ could become influential. Again, the People's Party argues this would undermine direct democracy.

The historical roots to this vote are deeper than the EU though: neutral Switzerland has always been cautious of joining big international organisations: it did not join the United Nations until 2002, and has been slow to ratify major UN conventions like the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

What's going to happen?

Latest opinion polls suggest voters may reject the proposal, because of the message on human rights that a yes vote might send to the rest of the world about Switzerland, which after all is home to the Geneva Conventions, and to the United Nations.

Image copyright SP Image caption The No campaign's poster features the US, Russian and Turkish presidents and says: "Switzerland won't join in"

But Swiss commitment to their neutrality and independence should never be underestimated, and polls have been wrong in the past. In 2009 Swiss voters defied predictions and backed a ban on the construction of minarets, violating, some argue, Switzerland's obligations to freedom of religious expression.

Don't they get fed up with referendums?

One thing the Swiss do not really argue about is their system of direct democracy. Although turnout is sometimes low, people do not complain about how often they are called on to vote.

They even vote on the same issues more than once. Direct democracy here means anyone can put an idea to the people as long as they gather 100,000 signatures.

It took three referendums over three decades before Swiss women got the right the vote in 1971.

PUNJAB'S DRUG MENACE: 'I WANTED MY SON TO DIE'

Image caption Lakshmi Devi's son died due to a drug overdose

The northern Indian state of Punjab has witnessed a sharp increase in the number of drug-related deaths this year. BBC Punjabi's Arvind Chhabra investigates why the drug menace has become worse in the state.

"He was my only son, but I had started wishing that he would die… And now, I cry the whole night with his photograph in my hand," says 55-year-old Lakshmi Devi.

Her son, Ricky Lahoria, recently died of a drug overdose. He was 25.

His was one of 60 deaths linked to drug abuse in Punjab between January and June 2018, according to official estimates. In comparison, 30 people died in drug-related incidents in all of 2017.

Police officials say that the number is likely to increase when they release data for the second half of 2018.

Drugs have been a scourge in Punjab for years now - once a transit point on the drug route, the state has now become a major consumer base.

Punjab's health minister Brahm Mohindra told the BBC his government had reduced the inflow of drugs into the state. But he could not explain why drugs had claimed more lives in 2018 than in previous years.

"It's not clear what concoction is causing [the] deaths. But so many deaths have happened. It is a serious and unfortunate thing," he said.

The All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi conducted the first comprehensive study in 2015 to estimate the magnitude of drug addiction in Punjab - and the report concluded that there were more than 200,000 addicts in the state.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Drug deaths in Punjab have soared in 2018

Ms Devi says Ricky started using drugs when he was still in school and, eventually, he dropped out.

In the early days, he was addicted to cough syrups and injections but he gradually turned to heroin, locally known as chitta.

At one point, his mother recalls, Ricky wanted to quit and even asked her for help. But she did not know that a rehab centre was an option.

"I just took him to a regular hospital, where he died after three days," she says.

'Champagne of intoxicants'

Data from various government departments shows that the problem seems to have got worse in recent years.

According to police records, 303kg of heroin was seized from the beginning of 2018 until 15 October. Only 191kg of heroin was seized from January to December 2017.

The BBC spoke to police officers, border security forces and intelligence officials to understand how drugs are distributed and consumed in the state.

They say the most commonly abused drugs in Punjab are the three opium derivatives - raw opium, poppy husk and heroin - followed by medications sold over the counter.

But addicts often see heroin as the "champagne of intoxicants". Like champagne, heroin is costly. One gram costs between 4000 ($56; £43) to 6000 rupees - an addict usually consumes half a gram to two grams in a single day.

While "misuse of pharmaceuticals" is more common in cities, heroin is "more prevalent in rural areas", says Sukhchain Singh, the police commissioner of Ludhiana city.

Despite its hefty price tag, heroin remains popular among addicts regardless of social class and income. Police told the BBC that this was because many of them also turned to peddling as a source of income.

Others simply steal to support their habit.

"Our jewellery and household goods started vanishing as he would take away and sell whatever items he could lay his hands on," one woman, whose son died due to addiction, told the BBC.

The porous border

The border fence that separates India and Pakistan is clearly visible from the rooftops of houses in Dhanoa Kalan village. Border security forces and police officers can be seen patrolling the streets and some of them are dressed as civilians.

Image caption Sukhdev Singh says famers often find white packets containing drugs in their fields

The village is home to about 1,400 adults and about 150 of them cultivate farm land beyond the border fence, which puts their fields in no man's land.

So these farmers cross the border almost every day and they are searched by the security forces when they return. Sometimes, they find packets of drugs in their fields.

"Last year, a farmer spotted some packets containing a white powder and he informed border security officers," says Sukhdev Singh, a former village chief.

Mr Singh says this has happened a few times. "We don't know who does it and how," he adds.

Security officers say smugglers often hurl packets of drugs across the border - and some farmers help them. Farmers also make cavities in their tools to hide the drugs, making it hard to detect them.

"All that the farmers have to do is carry these packets to their homes. Once it's inside Indian territory, couriers pick up these packets from the farmers," says an Indian intelligence officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Security forces routinely seize drugs at the India-Pakistan border

The couriers, he adds, then transport the packets to distributors in different cities. Police say they have discovered tunnels along the border that are used by smugglers.

The entire process relies on secrecy - most of those who are involved don't know who the kingpin is or even the names of couriers or distributors. All of this makes it hard to trace the smugglers who are running the operation, say security officials.

International network

About 20 battalions of India's Border Security Force (BSF) guard the border. But officers say smugglers sneak in through gaps in the fence or during dense fog in the winter.

In May 2017, police in Ludhiana city revealed that some farmers had Sim cards from Pakistan so that they could talk to smugglers across the border.

In July the following year, customs officers in Amritsar city seized packets of heroin concealed in the empty wagons attached to a goods train that had arrived from Pakistan.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gangs often place pipes along the border fence to smuggle drugs

"Most of the heroin comes from Afghanistan to India via Pakistan," says Rajesh Kumar Jaiswal, inspector general of the Punjab police force that investigates drug smuggling.

Punjab has become a major part of the so-called opium drug route that is now used for transporting heroin as well. Officials say smugglers use different routes to enter India, choosing between Punjab, Rajasthan or Indian-administered Kashmir.

"If there's pressure on the Punjab border then they shift to Rajasthan and if there's pressure there, they move elsewhere," Mr Jaiswal adds. "While [the] India-Pakistan border has been the usual route, we have seized narcotic consignments even from Delhi. And they could be arriving in Delhi from any border."

Nexus with security forces

The local police and security agencies have also been accused of helping smugglers.

In June 2016, the federal government's junior home minister, Kiren Rijiju, said in parliament that 68 employees of the Punjab police and other security forces were arrested due to their involvement in the drug trade.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Middlemen are also frequently arrested in different cities of Punjab

Two deputy superintendents of police have also been arrested in recent months on similar charges.

Senior officers acknowledge the problem, adding that they are taking strict action against such officers.

So, what is the solution?

Health officials say the state needs to open more rehab centres for addicts as there are too few existing ones. While there are 90 private rehab centres, there are only 50 that are run by the government.

The government has been running awareness campaigns in schools and colleges. But most families in rural areas do not know about rehab centres or how they can turn lives around. And the stigma associated with drugs often stops people from seeking help.

There are also attempts to understand what drives the youth of Punjab to drugs.

One survey of drug addiction, conducted by the Society for Promotion of youth and masses in the state said the biggest reason for people to start trying drugs was "fun", followed by "peer pressure". A second study, conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences also pointed to peer pressure.

"Punjab needs a three-pronged strategy to reduce supply, demand and consumption," says Dr D Basu, a psychiatrist who has studied drug addiction in the state.

Until then, he adds, stories like Ms Devi's will remain all too familiar.

"[Ricky] would sell whatever he could lay his hands on to buy drugs," Ms Devi says. "I wanted him to lead a normal life, have a family and earn enough for them. I felt so helpless, so broken whenever he became unconscious after taking drugs. He would forget where he was and what he was doing.

"In those moments, I would just wish and pray that he would die. But now I regret my words."

BREXIT: WILL SPAIN'S GIBRALTAR CONCERNS CRASH ON THE ROCK?

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Could Spanish concerns scupper Brexit progress?

How much of a threat is the Spain/Gibraltar question to the Brexit summit on Sunday?

Well, it could turn out to be either huge or simply a puff of smoke. Madrid and Downing Street say they are working on it.

There's not much time left for the question to assume either form.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May meets EU leaders in Brussels to sign off on the Brexit texts in just over 36 hours.

Grandstanding for his domestic audience aside, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez feels hoodwinked and angry.

Gibraltar is of great national interest, and hurt pride, for many Spaniards. It became official government policy during the Franco dictatorship to get back what Spaniards nickname "El Peñón" (The Rock).

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The small peninsula of Gibraltar has been a British territory since 1713

After the UK's Brexit vote, Spain at the very least saw an opportunity to re-gain considerable influence over Gibraltar.

Eyebrows shot up in the UK at the very start of the Article 50 process when article 24 of the EU's negotiating guidelines stated: "After the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom."

In fact, though, the bilateral UK-Spain talks that then took place in parallel to EU-UK Brexit negotiations went extremely smoothly... until just recently.

Spanish resentment started building after the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his team proposed going into a "tunnel" with UK negotiators - blocking out political and media noise - in an attempt to break the lengthy impasse over the wording of the Irish "backstop" - that guarantee to avoid a border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Spain claims Gibraltar is a part of the country because of its location on the Iberian peninsula

It is during that tunnel moment that Spain feels it was "betrayed".

By the time EU and UK negotiators emerged, the Irish backstop had become a UK-wide customs area, meaning it was potentially straying into post Brexit trade deal territory.

Yet neither in that text, nor in the draft of the political declaration on EU-UK future relations published on Thursday, is there mention of Gibraltar and the need for Spanish approval.

Image copyright Reuters

Prime Minister Sánchez believes the positive attitude Spain had shown in bilateral Brexit talks over Gibraltar is now being abused; that Spanish national interest was sacrificed in the tunnel in order to offer an extra "sweetener" to the UK in wider Brexit negotiations.

European Commission negotiators flatly deny this.

But Spain is not alone in believing that priorities of individual EU countries were ignored during tunnel negotiations.

France, Denmark and the Netherlands felt let down by their EU negotiators over pinning down ongoing fishing rights in UK waters in the political declaration on post Brexit EU-UK relations.

We have now heard that the fishing issue has been "resolved" (for now). The details have yet to emerge.

This means Gibraltar is the only outstanding issue ahead of Sunday's Brexit summit, according to the EU.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Fishing has been another contentious issue in the Brexit talks

Now, Spain's Prime Minister is hugely pro-European. He sees himself as a bit of a Macron number two.

It is not in his nature to scupper EU plans or an EU summit.

Remember when Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini refused to take in migrant boats earlier this year, Mr Sánchez was the first to step in and help in order to avert an EU crisis - and also to win brownie points in Brussels.

Pedro Sánchez is under a lot of domestic pressure. He heads a minority government and has been repeatedly accused by the main conservative opposition of being "soft" over Gibraltar in Brexit negotiations.

He also faces elections in the politically significant Andalucia region on 2 December. A part of Spain that neighbours - you guessed it - The Rock.

It is possible that Spain's prime minister has learned a lesson from Italy's deputy prime minister: that if you dig in your heels in the EU, you can get results.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Matteo Salvini is a harsh critic of the EU

He knows, of course, that holding the Brexit summit now, in November, was at Theresa's May's insistence; that the EU thought it possible to seal the deal next month instead.

This knowledge is in Mr Sánchez's back pocket.

It's important to bear in mind that while Spain doesn't have an actual veto over the Brexit divorce deal, EU leaders need to reach decisions by consensus at their summits. They don't actually put up their hands to vote.

There is no way they can rubber stamp a text designed for a leaving member (the UK) when an existing member (Spain) is so strongly opposed.

It is true, there is less EU solidarity with Spain over Gibraltar than there was with Ireland over the border issue. But the EU has been so proud about the very unusual unity amongst its members over Brexit, they won't want to give that up at this late stage.

So, in effect, Spain could exercise a moral or political "veto" on Sunday.

Which means that although Spain does not have a formal veto, it could exercise moral and political objections that would effectively stop other countries from voting against it.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Concerns about a hard border between the UK and Ireland have been a key feature of Brexit negotiations

EU insiders don't think it will come down to that. They believe this can be solved without reopening the Brexit texts by noting Spain's insistence on continuing UK.-Madrid bilateral talks in a declaration added to the texts or other possible EU formulas.

But even if Spanish opposition melts away before Sunday, the bitterness over Gibraltar, over fishing rights, over ensuring that the UK has no competitive advantages over European businesses in a post-Brexit trade deal, these are examples of the substantial obstacles the UK will face from EU countries in negotiating a trade deal with EU after Brexit.

And that's a deal the parliaments of every single EU country - including Spain's - will need to ratify unanimously.

'I PARTIED ALL NIGHT TO HIDE FROM MY PTSD'

A study suggests that one in six veterans who left the British military after serving in a combat role in Iraq or Afghanistan would probably qualify for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In some, the symptoms only appear years later.

On Remembrance Day in 2015, Phillip Riding, had been out of the military for one month. He went to the Cenotaph as a civilian, with his medals from Afghanistan pinned to a white shirt, and sang God Save the Queen with the crowd.

In the silence afterwards, a bugle sounded The Last Post. And in that moment, suddenly the memories of Afghanistan came flooding back.

"Something inside had snapped. I couldn't breathe, I was panicking standing there in the ceremony with tears rolling down my face," Riding says. "That sound of the bugle reminded me of the moment it was announced every time a comrade was lost."

Friends, killed or injured, flashed in front of his eyes: Bing from artillery, Tres shot in the ankle, Rocco, Plant, Coops, LJ shot in the shoulder, Jordan….

For five years he had been suppressing these thoughts.

"I thought I was fine but all of a sudden I wasn't any more. That door I kept shut, opened completely. This is how PTSD is, it's something that creeps up on you. It just totally destroyed me."

Riding joined the Army in August 2007 at the age of 16, partly to get out of his home town, Barrow-in-Furness, in Cumbria. He'd faced homophobic bullying at school and thought a "macho" role in the infantry would help mask the fact that he was gay.

"I was living with these guys seven days a week, and I started copying how straight men moved. My body language was super-exaggerated to be manly because I was trying to fit to this image of who I wanted to be in my head."

Image copyright Phil Riding

He would plaster his bedside with soft porn. "Bikini models were for sure not what I wanted to see first thing in the morning but there we are."

He even put a pretend girlfriend in his will before leaving for his tour of Afghanistan.

In 2010 the British military had the task of curbing opium production in Helmand Province. It was a dangerous job in territory largely controlled by the Taliban.

"Once you've been shot at it never leaves your brain. The bullet that comes near you sounds like a crack of a whip. There were countless operations where I was in a near-death situation, almost blown up in armoured vehicles by improvised devices or ducking shells from our Apache [helicopter]."

Riding wasn't hurt himself, but many were.

"There was a task to go out and do some metal-detecting. We played a game of rock paper scissors to decide who should go on patrol and who should stay behind. I won the game. He went out and was shot in the ankle."

Image copyright Phil Riding

One of his roles in Afghanistan was to drive lorries. Once he went on rest and recreation, and the driver who took his place rolled over an IED and ended up having his back reconstructed.

He was lucky, but being lucky made him feel guilty. "Shouldn't it have been me? Shouldn't I have gone on patrol?" he asks.

Coming close to death made Riding think hard about his life, and he decided to come out and live authentically as a gay man. "It was like being born again," he says. "This time I was being who I wanted to be - myself."

Initially his family didn't take the news well. Around Christmas 2011, when Same-Sex Marriage Bill was passing through Parliament, Riding's younger brother asked if he would get married. His grandmother then said she wouldn't attend the wedding if so, and his mother followed suit. "There was an argument, and I wish that I had handled it better," he says. He left home on Boxing Day.

Coming out to people in the army didn't go well either. Some former friends got up and left when he sat down next to them at dinner. Things only improved after he launched a complaint. Now he decorated his bedside exuberantly with rainbow flags and male pin-ups.

Image copyright Phillip Riding Image caption Marching at Pride in 2015

He also found solace in London's LGBT community, travelling up there at the weekends. The gay nightclub scene in Soho was so different from army life, it was a form of escape.

"It was blessing to talk to people who didn't know anything about the military or what it was like in Afghanistan.

"My friends were incredulous, teasing me: 'Seven months in Afghanistan? Just you and all those soldiers, and nothing happened? Yeah right!'"

Being in the army isn't like it's depicted in the movies. "Not everyone is really handsome, dashing. You're enjoying not thinking about romance. From the moment you wake up, you're working and your mind is on the job."

But the high-octane pace of clubbing also seemed to serve one of his needs after the tour in Afghanistan.

"When you have adrenaline pumped into you every single day for seven months, when you come home that's missing. Time moves slow. People moved slowly. It was so quiet. I needed to be in the clubs to fill that gap.

"Being in a nightclub, it's just so loud, the bass in the floor. There is so much energy everywhere - it's sensory overload."

Image copyright Joel Ryder

Riding had his driving licence revoked after being caught speeding twice in two years after he returned from Helmand. "Once I was going 85 mph on a 60 mph dual carriageway with music at full blast. Risky stuff like that because it was an adrenaline rush."

He thinks that the excitement of coming out probably helped to mask his PTSD after Afghanistan. "I didn't think I had an issue. I was dealing with accepting my sexuality and meeting all these new people. For the first time in my life, there were people who I fancied who actually fancied me back!"

When it came to renew his contract with the army in October 2015, he decided against it and took up a job as an events manager for a nightclub. He would go into Soho in the day, arrange the events and be ready to work late into the night, while socialising with friends.

But he found himself asking this question: "I've come out, but why am I still hitting the bottle? Why am I still not wanting to go to sleep?"

And a month later, on Remembrance Day, he received an answer.

Riding likens the feeling of suppressing his PTSD to trying to hold down an inflatable ball in water. "It's different for everybody, but this is what it's like for me. I kept trying to hold down all the things I saw and you can only hold it down for so long. The more you hold it down, the stronger the ball shoots back up, more powerful than before. And that's what happened with me."

He started having nightmares about his time on tour and working all night seemed to help him cope.

"I would have flashbacks. I did what I could to avoid closing my eyes in case I started to see Afghanistan," he says. "I wanted to physically exhaust myself, so that when I eventually got home in the early hours, I could just collapse in bed and I wouldn't dream."

The Last Post had been the first sound to trigger Riding's PTSD, but other everyday sounds now had the same effect - a motorcycle abruptly appearing from nowhere or someone yelling in the street.

What does PTSD feel like?

Flashbacks & nightmares: These can be so realistic that it feels as though you are living through the traumatic experience again and again - ordinary sounds, sights and smells can trigger flashbacks

Avoidance & numbing: You distract yourself by keeping your mind busy with an activity or working very hard, while avoiding places and people that remind you of the trauma - and you may try to become emotionally numb, feeling nothing at all

Being hypervigilant: You stay alert all the time, as though you are looking out for danger - anxiety makes it hard to sleep, and others may notice that you are irritable and cannot relax

Source: The Royal College of Psychiatrists

There was a trigger in the club as well.

"At midnight they have this balloon drop, balloons fall from the ceiling and they bounce on the crowd. The sound it makes is just like gunfire happening over my head."

The first time he experienced it he was frozen on the spot. "It shocked me that even though my brain was telling me I am literally just seeing balloons fall down, I couldn't move because I was panicking."

It got to the point that Riding would leave quickly when the balloon drop was about to happen and his friends noticed. "No-one understood why, because I didn't tell anyone. They just thought I was weirdo, that 'Phil doesn't like balloons.'"

He felt that working in the club brought some order to his life. "I was in the military for years, having that authority, I got used to it. In a way, being that person that people look to in the nightclub for direction is similar."

But the sense of the club as a safe space was shattered on 12 June 2016, when a gunman opened fire at a gay nightclub - Pulse, in Orlando, Florida - killing 49 people and injuring 53 before being shot dead by police. At the time, it was the deadliest massacre in modern American history.

Statistics on military PTSD

17% of ex-forces whose last deployment was a combat role in Iraq or Afghanistan would probably qualify for a PTSD diagnosis, according to a study published last month by the King's Centre for Military Health Research

PTSD prevalence rates for the military population as a whole have increased from about 4% in 2003-4 to about 6% in 2014-15 - the rate could be as high as 9% in some combat units, researchers from the King's Centre told the Commons Defence Select Committee in March

They added that 50% of the PTSD that arises in the forces is caused by non-operational traumatic incidents such as car accidents or assaults

Riding had actually been to Pulse in 2011. "I know the venue and I knew some of the people who were there that night. I think about them pinned down in the bathroom... and having to witness their friends and family being shot and killed," he says.

"It was horrifying, warfare coming into the community I know and love. Before I felt that I could keep the worlds apart but now they are crashing into each other. The idea that a terrorist attack could happen here too."

It wouldn't be the first time, Riding says, mentioning the 1999 nail-bomb attack carried out by a neo-Nazi at the Admiral Duncan, one of Soho's oldest gay pubs.

He started to be troubled by intrusive thoughts, imagining bad things happening to his family and friends. In Afghanistan he had been bothered by the thought that if he had acted differently, a comrade might not have got hurt. Now this kind of thinking became obsessive and infiltrated his daily life.

When meeting a friend for coffee in Soho, he would imagine a bomb exploding in the gay bar next door and his friend dying in front of him. "The questions cross my mind, 'What if they were just late by 10 minutes? What if I had just gone shopping, and they wouldn't have had to come meet me?'

"It never ends. This guilt is unbearable. Not just the guilt of what has happened but even hypothetical situations. So what can I do?"

It took years for Riding to be formally diagnosed with PTSD and start receiving therapy.

For a long time he tried to avoid seeking help, mistakenly believing that a diagnosis of PTSD on his medical record would harm his prospects when applying for jobs. Other soldiers were under the same illusion, he says.

"It's one of those urban legends. We simply didn't talk about mental health to each other so I didn't know. I wish I had known sooner."

Help for those affected

Nowadays he makes a conscious effort to rethink the noises that trigger his PTSD. At 27, he's made a conscious effort to associate the national anthem with good times. "It always has me in tears," he says. "I want to think instead about all the good times with all the brave lads."

He says that his sleeping is better now and that he's in control of his PTSD - not the other way round. Trying to bury it, he says, was the wrong idea.

"So if my PTSD is that inflatable ball - it's like it's been deflated. It'll still be here but I'm holding it down for now."

Megumi was a baby when her parents separated and her father disappeared from her life. But years later her mother told her he wanted to reconnect. Megumi began to see Yamada regularly. She thinks he is her father, and that Yamada is his real name - but this is a lie.

"Ever since she was little she'd ask me where he was," says Megumi's mother, Asako. "All she knew was that he had gone soon after she was born, so she blamed herself."

For years it didn't appear to be a problem. But when Megumi was about 10, Asako noticed a change in her daughter's behaviour.

"She didn't talk to me and became very quiet and withdrawn," Asako says.

"It took a long while to find out about the bullying."

Asako discovered that Megumi wasn't only blaming herself for her parents' breakup. Her classmates were also ostracising her because she didn't have a dad - children of single parents are often stigmatised in Japan.

Eventually she became so unhappy that she refused to go to school.

"She's my only child and it was breaking my heart to see her so sad," Asako says.

She tried to get the teachers at school to help, but when that failed another idea came into her head.

"All I could think about was, what if I found a man who was nice and kind, an ideal father, someone who would make her feel better?" Asako says.

She'd heard about relative rental agencies that could send an actor to play a guest at a wedding or go on a date - they are well established in Japan. So she contacted one to ask if they could also provide a fake dad. After auditioning five hopefuls, she settled on a man called Mr Takashi.

"I found him the easiest to talk to," Asako says. "He's very kind and sweet, so I just followed my instincts."

Takashi runs a rental agency with about 20 staff and more than 1,000 freelancers - men and women of different ages and backgrounds who can cater for almost any situation, taking on fake names, personalities and roles. They often have to lie, but they are very strict about not breaking the law.

As an actor himself, he's played boyfriends, businessmen, friends and fathers, and been a bridegroom at five fake weddings.

He prepares for his roles, he confesses, by watching Hollywood movies like Little Miss Sunshine, the Oscar-winning film about a dysfunctional family bonding on a road trip, and The Descendants, in which George Clooney plays an indifferent parent who suddenly has to embrace fatherhood after a family tragedy.

"I study these films, and memorise phrases and lines," Takashi says. "I take notes on how different family members interact and communicate, and what it takes to be a certain kind of father or husband. They help me understand different family dynamics and relationships."

Asako met Takashi several times to talk about the kind of father she wanted him to play to Megumi.

"My requests were very simple," she says. "Firstly, I wanted him to say how sorry he was that he couldn't be in Megumi's life until then. Secondly, I wanted him to listen to whatever she wanted to tell him."

Asako then told Megumi that her father had remarried and now had a new family, but that he had recently been back in touch because he wanted to see them again.

He was working, she said, as "an actor".

Megumi was shocked, but eventually agreed to meet him. And so, nearly 10 years ago, Takashi became Yamada, Megumi's father - his longest-running, and perhaps most ethically dubious role to date.

Takashi still remembers their first meeting.

"It was a very complex emotion that was there," he says. "She asked me why I hadn't come to see her before, and I felt her resentment."

As Yamada, Takashi began seeing Megumi and her mother a couple of times a month - joining them on days out, trips to the cinema and visiting for birthdays. And Asako says it didn't take long to see a real change in her daughter.

"After a while Megumi became much happier and more outgoing," she says. "She loved to talk, she was lively - she even wanted to go back to school, and that's when I thought, 'This has all been worth it!'"

One particular occasion sticks in Asako's mind - when she and Yamada were at Megumi's school parents' day.

"We were standing at the back of the classroom," Asako says. "She saw us together and kept on turning around to look at us. She had the biggest smile on her face and that made me really happy."

Takashi's services are not cheap. Each time Asako hires him to play Yamada she pays about 10,000 Yen, (about £70 or $90), and although she earns a decent salary she has to make savings elsewhere to afford it. But when she remembers how unhappy her daughter once was, she thinks it is money well spent.

Takashi also sees a difference in Megumi, from the quiet, hesitant girl that he first met.

"Gradually she became happier and more confident," he says. "I used to meet her with Asako, the three of us together, but one day she said, 'I want to go out with my father, just the two of us,' so I took her out and she held my hand for the first time."

Over the last 10 years, Takashi's character Yamada has grown very close to Megumi, now a young adult. He's become a part of the family. He even tells Megumi that he loves her, in the way that any father might - but, of course, he doesn't really.

How does he justify this act of deception?

"Switching personalities and identities is very important in this job," he says. "But I'm human, and so, of course, it would be a lie if I said I don't feel any emotional conflict saying, 'I love you,' to that child. But this is a business, I have to do it, and I have to keep reminding myself of that."

Asako also understands that some might disagree with her choices.

"I know what I'm doing is drastic," she says. "But I really, really wanted to save my daughter."

To complicate matters, she has also become very attached to the fictional character she is paying Takashi to portray.

"When the three of us are together, I feel at peace," she says.

"We talk, we laugh and we are very kind to each other. He's been in our lives for such a long time now, I would like to marry him and become a real family."

But Asako has had to face the bittersweet reality that she is in love with someone who isn't real and who cannot love her back.

"I have told him [how I feel], but he told me to my face that he's with us because it's his job. It's very complicated," she says.

"I'm very aware that he's only with us because we're paying him.

"I sort of fantasise about our relationship, that maybe we can be a real family, but the relationship as it is actually helps me emotionally and mentally as well. It keeps me stable."

In fact, Asako has no plans to end the arrangement with Takashi and says she would like to carry on hiring him to play Megumi's dad indefinitely - even if that means sinking deeper and deeper into a world of fantasy and deception.

"The ideal situation is that she continues to think of him as her father," she says. "So when she gets married I'd like him to be at her wedding ceremony, and when she has her own child, I'd like him to act as a grandfather as well. The worst case scenario is that my daughter finds out."

And if Megumi's real father were to ever turn up?

That's not a possibility that Asako has ever really considered. As she hasn't had any contact with him since their divorce she feels it is unlikely - but if he did walk through the door one day, she thinks Megumi would choose Yamada over her real dad, because they have such a good "father-daughter" relationship. He is the ideal father, just as Asako hoped he would be.

Takashi is also aware that the lie could continue to grow.

"This is one of the big issues of renting a family," he says. "Megumi could get married in the future and then her husband would think I'm her father. If she then has her own child that means she'd believe I'm the grandfather of her child, and the stakes get bigger and bigger."

And he has thought about how Megumi might feel if she finds out - though the plotlines he envisages might strike many as highly optimistic.

"In the best case scenario, I'd like to think that she might thank me for taking care of her - that is 80% of my imagination," he says.

"The other 20% thinks that she would be devastated. She might say, 'Why did you come clean? Why couldn't you just keep lying to me until the end?'

"I think I've been a big support in her life... Maybe asking her to thank me is a bit excessive, but at least I'd like her to recognise our service."

Many might also find it hard to understand why Asako has chosen to do something which could be so distressing for her daughter, if she discovers the truth. Yet she stands by her decision.

"I know some people think it's foolish to pay money to lie to my own daughter and to have a pretend father, but I was desperate," she says.

"Anyone can understand that horrible feeling of desperation, to see your child so hurt."

She says she does worry about the potential impact on Megumi, but tries not to think about it.

And she thinks this kind of thing happens more than you might imagine.

"My situation isn't unique. I'm sure there are loads more surrogate fathers and mothers out there."

All names have been changed to prevent Megumi uncovering the deception before her mother is ready to tell her

BILLY MONGER: 'I LOST MY LEGS BUT NOT MY DAREDEVIL SPIRIT'

It's a grey day in April 2017. Billy Monger gets his car into action as the lights signal. He has done this countless times before. He knows that once the race is underway, there’s no time for nerves – he needs to stay sharp.

Ahead of him, toy-like racing cars career around a slick track, faster and faster until they’re reaching speeds of well over 100mph. Weaving and swerving, they battle one another for position – and Billy tries to make his way through the field.

It’s two weeks before Billy’s 18th birthday, but he's more excited about this race than impending adulthood. On the racetrack, he’s known as Billy Whizz – a young driver with bags of potential. Today, he's competing in the Formula 4 British Championship at Donington Park – one of the UK's most famous circuits. F4 is the first step for any young driver like Billy, who dreams of driving in Formula 1 – motorsport's top tier. So far, this season is going well for him. If he makes it into the top three today, he looks set to continue his progress up the motorsport ladder.

But the race is off to a chaotic start. Nineteen-year-old Jamie Caroline, Billy’s best friend, spins out early, forcing Billy to spin too, to avoid him – it puts them both in a bad position. Adrenaline and petrol mix as the racers push their cars faster and faster, banking left and right to avoid one another.

THE CRUNCH OF AN APPLE MAKES ME WANT TO RUN AWAY

Margot Noel has a condition called misophonia, which literally means "hatred of sound". It can be so disturbing that she has to wear headphones or ear plugs to protect herself.

Someone takes a bite out of an apple.

There's a drawn-out crunch as the teeth break through the tough skin of the fruit.

The noise is unbearable for 28-year-old Margot Noel.

"I have to leave or cover my ears. I just cannot hear it," she says.

"It puts me in a state of distress, it makes me really anxious. My body feels there's danger - I need to leave or I need to protect myself."

Margot has misophonia, which she describes as a brain dysfunction that causes common sounds to produce an intense emotional response - such as anger, panic, fear or distress.

In people with this condition, the part of the brain that joins our senses with our emotions - the anterior insular cortex - is overly active and wired up to other parts of the brain in a different way.

There are many possible trigger sounds, but some of the most common are related to food - crunching, slurping or sipping.

Margot's trigger sounds include the crunching of crisps, whispering, clicking noises made with pens, keyboard tapping and one of the worst - knuckle cracking.

"My reaction to this one is really physical because it's one of the worst for me," she says.

"It makes me jump off my chair and I'll have to do something to make it stop, which is not the case with all of my other triggers.

"It's not like a sound you don't like, it's much more than that, it's completely different. It's something I feel in my stomach, like extreme anxiety. Or suddenly I feel overwhelmed, I can't think any more, it just takes over everything.

"If someone had a gun and they were pointing it at me, it would feel exactly the same."

According to the British Tinnitus Association's website, trigger sounds tend to be "human-generated noises that are under voluntary control", such as sniffing.

But if Margot sniffs herself, that's different.

"I can stop doing it if I want, so it's not as threatening as someone else doing something that you can't control and you don't know how long it's going to last for," she says.

One of her earliest memories is of her brother tormenting her by clicking his tongue.

"I'm about six or seven and it's a constant fight between us," she says. "My brother knows that tongue-clicking is a problem for me, I've said it a few times, so now he has power over me and he's two years younger than me. If I annoy him, if I don't do something he wants, he will just start tongue-clicking."

Margot's parents didn't understand how the noise was affecting her and so would tell Margot to "grow up," and put up with it.

Now they are older, Margot says her brother is much more understanding, but she is reluctant to complain if he makes a sound that is excruciating to her.

"I was having dinner with my brother yesterday. I gave him a gum after dinner and he was chewing it like a cow, it was horrendous, and I didn't want to ask him to chew less loudly, because people usually get offended," she says.

"They feel like it's an attack or a criticism when it's not, it's actually not. I'm the problem, but it's very difficult to ask people to make less noise because they always end up feeling like they can't be themselves around you."

Although she says she's had the condition all her life, she didn't realise it was misophonia until about three years ago.

"It was becoming clearer that I had a problem and I couldn't find what it was. Sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't have the right keywords on Google.

"One day I was really angry and I was crying, because I was watching an amazing play and I was just distracted the whole time by someone breathing like they were going to die, and I went back home, looked again, again, again and then I found it, and from that moment, to be honest, it was really great just understanding."

Margot also discovered, via Google, that a study into misophonia was being conducted at Newcastle University and emailed the person in charge, Dr Sukhbinder Kumar, to thank him.

He wrote back, and soon invited Margot to take part.

What is misophonia?

Also known as Selective Sound Sensitivity, misophonia is a strong emotional response to the presence or anticipation of a sound. There are three key emotional responses: anger, disgust and anxiety, with anger being the predominant emotion.

These intense emotions are accompanied by high levels of arousal - the fight or flight response. There is a release of adrenaline and a supply of energy to respond to the threat. This is typically experienced as a fast heart beat, rapid shallow breaths, tension, hotness, shakiness, and sweating.

Work environments, such as open plan offices, can be a minefield of triggers. Tensions can develop within intimate relationships and couples can find it difficult to share normal activities together, as someone breathing or eating can become infuriating.

The trial was terrifying. She had to listen to some of her trigger sounds without reacting to them or even closing her eyes.

"I had wires all over my face, everywhere, and they were studying my reactions to the sounds and I just couldn't do all of it," she says.

"It wasn't that I gave up, because I told them I wanted to do it, but they said I had to stop because I was too distressed and it was confusing the results.

"I think I had to do six modules and I only did two, and after two I was just crying like I'd never cried before."

Margot found the trial so distressing because she could not use any of her usual coping mechanisms to escape the trigger sounds. In day-to-day life she wears ear plugs or headphones to block the noises out.

"I cannot live without music," she says. "My headphones are on my ears all the time, even if there's no music in them - just ready to rescue me if something happens. Music for me feels very much like a protection."

Artists such as Moby, David Bowie, Air, Diana Ross, Oasis and Daft Punk have become the soundtrack to her life, she says.

Margot's anti-misophonia playlist:

Moby - Inside

Moby - One of these mornings

Moby - Another woman

Air - Talisman

Air - La femme d'argent

Air - Le soleil est près de moi

David Bowie - Ashes To Ashes

David Bowie - Starman

David Bowie - Drive-In Saturday

Tommy Tee - Aerosoul

Daft Punk - Make Love

Daft Punk - Emotion

Aphex Twin - Heliosphan

Rappin 4 Tay - Playaz Club

DJ Mehdi - Signatune

Even watching a film can be difficult.

"I hate, for example, the sound of people kissing. That disgusts me, I find it 'aargh!!'" she says. "One film out of two has people kissing passionately. Some films they don't make too much sound, but in others they do and I'll just have to cover my ears and wait for it to be finished."

When it comes to her own relationships, however, misophonia has not caused any problems so far.

"I try to surround myself with people that are understanding," she says.

"For me it would be a major downer if I was with a guy and I told him, 'Can you stop cracking your knuckles?' and he made fun of me. That would be an absolute no no for me. I'd be like, 'Well, goodbye.'

"I think if people like you they just try to like all the little things about you, even the ones they don't really understand. If you really like someone you don't want them to feel uncomfortable, you want to make them happy."

Margot is currently seeing someone and has a good social life, but says living with misophonia can be very isolating. She lives on her own, which she says is a "dream," and works as a freelancer for advertising agencies.

"I'm quite solitary. I write a lot, alone, in my office, like a tortoise," she says.

Dr Sukhbinder Kumar says there is no scientifically validated method to cure misophonia, but that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has shown some initial positive results.

It's also not clear how many people have the condition, he says, though he points out that one study conducted among undergraduates showed that as many as 20% had significant misophonia symptoms.

Margot often doesn't tell people about her own symptoms as she finds they are not always sympathetic - and sometimes even think it's something she has invented.

"I just try to deal with it on my own without asking people to change their behaviour," says Margot.

She hopes the study she took part in will eventually lead to new treatments. But also looks forward to a day when more people know that the condition exists.

"If I could just ask someone next to me in the theatre, 'I'm sorry, can you just try to not do that noise, I have misophonia,' and they would be like, 'Oh I'm really sorry,'... That is what I'm hoping for more than a treatment - just being able to have that discussion with someone without them making me feel like I'm a freak."

CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES: THE DAY PARADISE BURNED DOWN

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images

"Heavenly father, please help us."

Sitting in the back seat of the car her husband was driving, Brynn Parrott Chatfield's entire field of vision was filled with flames as she prayed.

Only the thin strip of road in front of them remained unburned.

Shades of orange, white, purple and pink burst out on both sides, hundreds of small fires all burning at the same time, low on the ground and up and over the trees.

"Please, help us to be safe."

A wave of embers rose up from the surface of the road and struck their front windscreen. Brynn's husband Jeremy drove calmly on down the middle of the road; no-one would be coming towards them into the fire.

"I'm thankful for Jeremy and his willingness to be brave..."

By now, no road was visible, and only a dense orange cloud could be seen in front of the car. Then suddenly, it cleared, and the fires seemed to scatter.

Clear skies opened up, the last embers bounced off the windscreen and the fire was finally behind them.

As a helicopter flew overhead, carrying water to try and douse the flames, Jeremy and Brynn knew they had made it out alive.

Soon after, almost nothing would remain of their hometown, Paradise, and the fire they fled in north-east California would become the deadliest and most destructive in the state's history.

This is the story of how the fire spread.

Thursday, 8 November

06:15

It is known, simply, as Incident No: 181108-9002.

The incident report, logged by the utility company, Pacific Gas & Electric, shows that damage occurred at this time in a power line outside the small community of Pulga.

This significance of this is not yet clear, but it may prove to be the spark that lit what became known as the Camp Fire.

PG&E have since begun co-operating with investigators, and point out that no cause has yet been determined.

But the company had warned a day earlier that it might turn off power in the area because of strong winds expected on the Thursday. In the end, it decided not to do so "as weather conditions did not warrant this safety measure".

A lawsuit has already been filed against PG&E, alleging negligence and health and safety code violations.

06:29

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) reports that a wildfire has started outside Pulga, about three miles north-east of Paradise.

07:30

Staff at the Adventist Health Feather River Hospital in Paradise, about 25 miles from Pulga in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, are warned that the Camp Fire is getting close to town and that they should evacuate their patients.

One nurse, Tamara Ferguson, is carrying out checks on new mothers in the maternity ward alongside a new trainee. She spots an orange glow out of the window and steps outside with her colleagues.

As they look up at the sky, ash starts to fall like snow.

She and other hospital staff, including surgical nurse Karen Davis, begin to move the hospital's 67 patients into any vehicle they can find.

07:50

Sorrell Bobrink is waking up at home in Paradise when she receives a phone call from a friend.

Her friend is in Oroville, some 20 miles from Paradise down in the Sacramento Valley. From her house, she looks up towards Paradise and sees flames, and worries that Sorrell might be in danger there.

"It looked like the sunrise was coming up," Sorrell, 39, later tells the BBC. "But we were far past sunrise. There was this moment of 'Oh, that's odd...that's not good.'"

Within eight minutes of the phone call, Sorrell is hosing water on to the roof of her home of two years, before turning on sprinklers. It won't be enough to save her house.

Sorrell picks up whatever clothes she can, leaving behind all items of sentimental value: her midwifery books, the notebook her mother put together aged 21.

She puts her son, cat and dog in the car and, before leaving, grabs a cup of coffee from her kitchen counter.

08:06

Having made his morning coffee, William Hart steps out of his home in Paradise and notices the darkening grey-brown sky. His first reaction is not that a wildfire is on its way.

"We're in Paradise, in the mountains. Everyone has a chimney here," he says later. "But when we saw black, brown smoke coming, we knew it wasn't chimney smoke."

He finds his bag - still unpacked since he moved into the house six days earlier - and his housemate picks up the urn that carries her late husband's ashes.

09:26

The sky over Paradise is by now a deep sepia as the smoke starts to blot out the sun.

Within 10 minutes, it is as though night has fallen.

The only lights are those of the cars trying to make it out of town, but much of the traffic has ground to a halt. Ash falls on Paradise at a rapid rate.

"No, it is not six o'clock or seven o'clock at night, people," William Hart says on a video he broadcasts on Facebook. "I don't even know what the eff time it is."

His is the last car in the queue leaving Paradise as the flames close in.

As she tries to leave town, nurse Karen Davis' vehicle breaks down.

"Fire was coming on both sides. It was a fire tornado," she later tells CBS. "All of a sudden, it filled with black smoke."

Karen calls her daughter Wendy, who can hear the sound of heavy items falling on the car, and a crackling noise over the line.

"It's getting really hot. I can't breathe," Karen says.

"Well guess what?" Wendy says, urging her mother to leave. "I'm not going to be here on this line listening to you die."

Karen steps out of her vehicle, hitches a ride back into Paradise and heads towards her hospital again.

Nearby, another nurse, Tamara Ferguson, is in an ambulance leaving town with a critically ill patient and other staff.

Over the radio, they hear that one of the ambulances ahead of them has caught fire. They pull over and realise they can't make it any further, and hear the small blasts of transformers exploding around them.

Looking at the only house that is not burning, they decide to shelter with patients inside its garage.

Tamara and her colleagues start stripping away loose vegetation from near the house to try and stop it catching fire. Others spray the roof and start stockpiling water as the fire gets closer.

The flames grows bigger around them, and cars become caught in gridlock. Tamara calls family members, telling them how she loves them, how sorry she is for mistakes she may have made.

She asks her eldest daughters to look after their youngest siblings. When she finally makes contact with her boyfriend, he tries to calm her down and tells her to breathe slowly.

"Babe, there's no way I'm going to survive this," she replies.

10:37 onwards

Sorrell Bobrink, her son, cat and dog are moving north out of Paradise, but the fire creeps ever closer into the road, reducing it from a five-lane highway into one with two lanes, and slowing traffic just as people want to move more quickly.

Sorrell knows that each decision she makes could be fatal. She knows there is a section in the road up ahead that is not surrounded by trees. But with little around her to help her get her bearings, she doesn't know how close it is. So she fears she may be driving herself and her passengers to their deaths.

Instead, she makes it out.

So too do the nurses, who return with their patients to the Adventist Health Feather River Hospital in Paradise, despite the fire getting closer there.

Emergency crews carry out triage on the patients who need it, and Tamara Ferguson helps treat two women who have just undergone caesarean sections.

As the fire creeps towards them, staff move patients as high as they can, up to the hospital's helipad, which fills with wheelchairs, stretchers and blankets.

Eventually, they all manage to drive away to other hospitals in the region, leaving just as the fire starts to consume their own hospital.

"I looked out the back window at the devastation, while I conversed with the sweetest 95-year-old woman," Tamara later says. "We watched the flames beside us, burnt cars in the road, power lines down and fresh homes burning. It went on for miles.

"I honestly couldn't believe I was alive, that I would see my family, kids and boyfriend again."

Car tires pop around William Hart as they succumb to the fire. Along the way, he picks up a passenger and two abandoned dogs, who sit on his back seat as he records his journey on his phone.

William passes the charred remains of other dogs, and some which he believes are human. He can't look at the footage, and deletes it, then keeps driving for hours once the fire is behind him.

At least 79 people were killed, many as they became trapped in their cars as the fire surrounded them.

Within only a day and a half of it starting, the Camp Fire destroyed more properties than any other fire in California before it.

More on the California fires

"Boys, this is paradise."

Those are the words, according to local legend, that led to the small mill town gaining its name in the 1860s.

William Leonard and his crew are said to have just returned from delivering lumber to a mill when he sat down underneath a pine tree, looked out at the view, and spoke those words.

Over time, Paradise grew to be a bucolic town of 27,000 residents, known for its cooler temperatures and slower pace of life among the trees.

There was the Gold Nugget Museum, that talked of the Native American prospectors who first settled the area.

There was the Black Bear Diner, with its all-day breakfasts and friendly sign ("Welcome to Bearadise").

But there were also those pines, the ones that William Leonard sat under in the 1860s, and the ones that played their part in the destruction of the town.

Conditions in California mean that if a wildfire ignites, it can spread at speed.

The state has suffered especially dry weather recently, and California Governor Jerry Brown has acknowledged the role man-made climate change has played in making those conditions worse.

This would be bad enough in itself, but the powerful winds - warm, dry air travelling from the east to the coast - have turned vegetation into tinder across the state. Areas like Paradise, which is at the bottom of mountains over which the winds barrel down, are especially at risk.

Those winds helped whip up the Camp Fire and led it to jump canyons, roads and emergency fire-breaks that had been dug to try and stop the flames spreading. On the morning the Camp Fire swept through Paradise, there were gusts of up to 55mph.

"It was just so fast," Sorrell Bobrink says, still unable to understand how things got so bad, so quickly.

Image copyright AFP

A map of damaged properties in Paradise shows strange streaks, isolated pockets where the fire flashed by and left little damage.

In some neighbourhoods, one house would remain standing while all others around were destroyed. A rubber duck stood untouched even though the house in which it once sat no longer existed. While almost all of the interior of one shop was incinerated, cardboard boxes holding gas grills were left barely burned.

Houses that suffered no damage at all are few and far between, however. So far, the Camp Fire has destroyed close to 12,500 properties and 151,000 acres. Ten days on, it continues to burn and it is unlikely to be fully contained until the end of the month.

As Paradise was lost, and two other large wildfires spread in southern California this week, Gov Brown said he refused to accept this was the new normal. "This is the new abnormal," he said.

But in interviews, Camp Fire survivors would often cite other fires they or relatives had survived in recent times - the Carr Fire, the Thomas Fire, the Tubbs Fire, the Mendocino Complex Fire - each different in its own way, but which together signify a new sort of threat California must learn to live with.

Survivors are now scattered across the state - some in Red Cross camps, some in a temporary tent city that has popped up in the car park of a Walmart store in nearby Chico.

Meanwhile, relatives of the roughly 1,000 people who are still officially listed as missing are now being asked to give DNA samples so police can match them to any remains that are found.

Police dogs trained in picking up the scent of bodies are being taken through the piles of ash where houses once stood.

"I will forever be changed, as so many thousands of others were," Tamara Ferguson says.

"Not by what was physically lost, but by the reminder that life changes quickly."

WHY USING 'BABY-TALK' IMPROVES OUR BOND WITH DOGS

Image copyright Getty Images

Using "dog-speak" is important in building a bond between a dog and their owner, scientists from the University of York have found.

During a series of tests, dogs were spoken to in a high-pitched voice and again in a normal adult voice.

Researchers then monitored which speaker the dogs responded to and wanted to interact with.

PhD student Alex Benjamin said it seemed dogs were more likely to favour the speaker who used a high pitch.

Baby talk

The researchers wanted to test whether speaking to dogs in "dog-directed" speech was useful to the animals, or whether humans did this simply because they view pets in the same way as babies.

"Dog-directed" speech involves speaking in a high-pitched voice with exaggerated emotion - in a similar way that adults often talk to small children.

Dr Katie Slocombe from the university's department of psychology explains: "This high-pitched rhythmic speech is common in human interactions with dogs in western cultures, but there isn't a great deal known about whether it benefits a dog.

"We wanted to see whether social bonding between animals and humans was influenced by the type and content of the communication."

Who's a good boy then?

During the tests, phrases such as "you're a good dog!" and "shall we go for a walk?", were used.

Next, another person would talk to the animal in a normal voice about non-dog-related content, for example "I went to the cinema last night."

The speakers then mixed "dog-directed" speech with non-dog-related words, and normal speech with dog-related words.

Researchers measured both the attentiveness of the dog while the speaker was talking, and whom the dog wanted to interact with once the speaker had finished.

The scientists found dogs were more likely to want to spend time with the speaker who had used both "dog-directed" speech and dog-related content.

When the different types of speech were mixed up dogs did not show a preference for either speaker.

It led student Alex Benjamin to conclude: "This suggests that adult dogs need to hear dog-relevant words spoken in a high-pitched emotional voice in order to find it relevant."

The researchers could start looking into whether puppies demonstrate similar preferences, however there are no plans to carry out the same tests with cats.

'THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEX I CONTRACTED HIV'

Image copyright Nathaniel Hall Image caption A teenage Nathaniel Hall at about the time of his HIV diagnosis

The first time Nathaniel Hall had sex, he contracted HIV. He was 16 years old and had only recently come out as gay. Fear, shame and self-loathing caused him to keep his diagnosis a secret from his family for the next 14 years.

He "came out" for the second time in his life last year and took back control by writing a play about his experience. Nathaniel, a 32-year-old theatre practitioner and drag artist from Manchester, hopes his one-man show will spark a conversation about representations of HIV in popular culture.

Nathaniel explains how he coped with learning he was HIV positive while he was still a child.

Image copyright Nathaniel Hall Image caption "He told me that he had been tested and that he had a clean bill of health... at 16 you don't really have the capacity to challenge that"

The 'summer romance' with an older man

I knew I was gay from around 13 or 14 but in 2003 it was a very different time. It wasn't even an option in school. It was all secret... to sort of find out who else was gay.

And then this guy... I was 16 he was older than me in his early to mid-20s. All of a sudden this older gay man gave me some attention and almost validated me - it was very intoxicating. So we started seeing each other.

That relationship didn't last long; it was only a couple of months, really. It all happened in the summer - between school and college - a summer romance, as it were. And then we kind of went our separate ways.

When I told him [about the HIV diagnosis], I got messages from his friends - bearing in mind they were older than me - saying I was just a silly little boy and I was making it up and worse than that.

So I just really wanted him to get tested and get the treatment required so that he wouldn't pass it on, because most infections come from people who don't know they have the virus.

But I never found out whether he knew. He told me that he had been tested and that he had a clean bill of health... at 16 you don't really have the capacity to challenge that.

Image copyright Nathaniel Hall Image caption "I was told the prognosis was around 37 years"

'It felt like being hit by a bus'

I had just turned 17 when I got the diagnosis. I remember them being very, very kind to me in the clinic and I don't really remember much else, other than getting the news. Then going back home and having to make this decision... I made the snap decision to go into my bedroom and close the door, instead of going and saying what had happened.

It felt like being hit by bus… because when I try and recall it, it's almost a physical sensation of being hit quite hard. I remember crying. What I was told was very different to what you get told today.

It certainly wasn't the era of the Aids epidemic... medication was around and they were good and improving, but I was told the prognosis was around 37 years. So to actually have a figure put on that at that age was quite a heavy thing to deal with.

I did have counselling through my college and did have support and I kind of thought I was OK until late last year when I had a bit of a breakdown.

Image copyright Nathaniel Hall Image caption "At school the only sex education we had about a gay relationship was a video...in which a gay man was dying from Aids"

'I think that shame really controlled me'

I think shame is the big one... it's really the only disease where there is a moral judgement attached to it and even - to a certain degree - a self-judgement.

I was gay... but you grow up in a straight world. You hear that you are morally wrong, or what you do is dirty and you should be ashamed of it. So I was becoming really acutely aware of that.

Then you hear those kind of warnings - "oh, you are going to be punished". So it was kind of like those prophecies were coming true, right at that moment, and it was a very powerful - and that was the shame that I put on to myself.

When I was at school the only sex education we had about a gay relationship was a video that we watched in which a gay man was dying from Aids.

It was completely out of date and so these messages that I was getting - that I was somehow secondary or that what I was doing was wrong or immoral or whatever - they weren't coming from my family but they were coming from all around me.

They sink in over time and then all of a sudden, I kind of became that stereotype. So I think that shame really, really controlled me.

'I didn't recognise who I was'

I think the key moment was when I was still up two days after a party and I had not really slept at all. I looked at myself in the mirror and I didn't recognise who that person was.

I realised at that point that drugs and alcohol had... not necessarily taken over my life... but I had abused them in a way that was not good for me any more.

It was in no way a heavy addiction or anything like that but I was self-medicating through alcohol. I was just trying to get rid of this low-level anxiety and stress that had built up over the years.

I realised that if I didn't do something about it then, it could escalate into a real and serious problem. Something had to change.

'They were sorry I felt I had to keep it secret'

I needed to tell my family. I had tried many, many times before but it never happened and never came out. So I started on the journey of making the play and I started to write stuff and make sense of things through my writing. Then I decided to write a letter to my parents and brothers and sisters.

I gave myself an afternoon to write everything down that I wanted to say. I told myself that I didn't necessarily need to send it, I just needed to get it written down and then see how I felt about it.

But after writing it, I actually felt quite calm so I just put them in envelopes straight away and got them posted before I could change my mind.

I did it that way because I had tried so many times to say it and I couldn't. And I also didn't think I could do it four times in a row without just being an emotional wreck by the end of it.

Image copyright Nathaniel Hall Image caption Nathaniel Hall is now in long-term relationship and feeling "liberated" after telling his loved ones about his HIV

The response was quite underwhelming, to be honest! It was a little bit like how I know a lot of gay people feel before they come out. This fear of what might happen but... everyone sent me text messages and called me and they were absolutely fine. They were just sorry that I felt I had to keep it secret for this long.

My mum came over the next day and we had a chat. My big thing was that they would be upset that I had not told them and kept this really big thing from them. But my mum said: "I'm just upset my son was struggling with this for so long on his own."

It was the fear. There was some internalised homophobia that lots of gay men have and then this other layer of shame and the fear builds on top of that, and all of that is really powerful. Even if you have a really loving family, you struggle to tell them.

'I used to wake up every morning with a knot in my heart'

It's not like all of a sudden everything is fixed. But writing and working on the show has taken me to some difficult places and that's been hard.

But I have felt a lot lighter and a lot more able to deal with things and some of the anxiety that had built up. I used to wake up every morning with a knot in my heart, in my chest.

I never used to think that it had affected me but after I told my family it released a little a bit and I thought, "oh my gosh, you lived with this almost crippling anxiety". Every morning, the first thing I felt was fear in my chest, tightness - and I can feel it now as I'm talking about it.

But since I've gone on that journey, admitting about that breakdown and some of the bad choices I have made and making peace with that, I don't need to be the perfect person I was trying to be - and that was very freeing and very liberating.

Told through a series of personal letters, poems, confessions and Nathaniel's drag alter-ego, Sue, First Time is about growing up gay and HIV positive.

The play is part of a series of events at Waterside Arts, Sale to mark 30 years since the first World Aids Day.

Held in conjunction with the Greater Manchester PaSH Partnership (Passionate about Sexual Health), the weekend will also feature creative workshops, a gallery exhibition, free HIV testing and a "coming out" party to raise money for HIV charities.

ANDAMANS: US MAN'S DEATH PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON 'TRIBAL TOURISM'

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Andaman is home to five "particularly vulnerable" tribes including the Jarawas and North Sentinelese

The killing of an American national by members of an endangered tribe in the Andaman islands off India's east coast has renewed concerns over the surreptitious practice of "tribal tourism" in the archipelago, Omkar Khandekar writes.

The indigenous islanders of North Sentinel, among the last of the "uncontacted" tribes in the world, killed 27-year-old John Allen Chau with arrows when he went to their island last week.

Police said that Chau had paid 25,000 rupees ($354; £275) to six local fishermen to take him to North Sentinel. Media reports suggested he wanted to introduce the islanders to Christianity.

Andaman is home to five "particularly vulnerable" tribes. They are the Jarawas, North Sentinelese, Great Andamanese, Onge and Shompen. The Jarawas and the North Sentinelese haven't integrated with the mainstream population yet. This makes them a source of intrigue for many of the 500,000 tourists who visit the islands every year.

Earlier this year, the Ministry of Home Affairs passed a notification exempting foreign nationals from having to acquire restricted area permits (RAP) to visit 29 islands in the archipelago.

The list includes nine islands in Nicobar and two in Andaman, occupied by tribal and indigenous communities considered "particularly vulnerable". Among them was also North Sentinel island.

But authorities insist tourists will still have to obtain permission from the district authority and the forest department to do so.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption To see the Jarawas, many tourists take a two-hour bus ride that cuts through the Jarawa reserves

The Jarawas live in a 1,028km forest reserve between the south and middle Andamans.

To see them, many tourists take a two-hour bus ride from Andaman's capital Port Blair to Baratang which is home to limestone caves and mud volcanoes. To do so, they travel on the Andaman Trunk Road (ATR) which cuts through the Jarawa reserves.

In 2013, the Supreme Court banned tourists from taking the ATR after a video shot by a journalist showed policemen forcing six Jarawa women to dance for tourists. The court reversed the decision after the state administration submitted a notification promising that no tourist or commercial establishment in the area would be permitted.

"The administration has long prioritised the livelihood of the locals," says Manish Chandi from the Andaman Nicobar Environment Team, who has been studying the islands for the past 18 years.

"After the court's ruling, it set up a ferry to Baratang island from Port Blair. It was a clever move. If questioned, they could always say it has made an alternative to the road available and the choice now rests on the tourists. But invariably, tourists 'choose' the road."

There is no direct connection to the North Sentinel islands, which are located 50km west of the capital Port Blair. There is also frequent patrolling by the coastguard to keep intrepid travellers at bay. And yet, says Mr Chandi, people keep attempting to see the North Sentinelese - often by bribing local fishermen.

"In 2013-14, a Mumbai-based businessman on a sports fishing boat was caught by the coastguard looking at the North Sentinelese," says Mr Chandi.

"Often, yachts carrying foreign tourists pass by the islands. But most are deterred by the coastguard patrol and make sure they don't lurk around."

Officials from the Department of Forest and Wildlife didn't respond to phone calls by the BBC. But Govind Ram, director of the Department of Tribal Welfare in the islands, indicates he is aware of the instances of tribal tourism.

"It's true that people have a fascination to see the tribal community," he says. "We have made all arrangements to restrict this from happening. There's regular patrolling by the police and officials from the tribal welfare department."

But given the size of the areas meant to be patrolled, he adds, "there is a chance that miscreants can enter".

And despite official insistence that foreigners will still need to obtain permission from the district authority and the forest department to visit Jarawa reserves and North Sentinel, conservationists say the scrapping of restricted area permits for these islands sends a signal that they will eventually be opened for tourism.

"The decision was taken unilaterally, without any consultation with local stakeholders," said Denis Giles, editor of the local newspaper Andaman Chronicles. "Instead of taking measures that might lead to tribal tourism, the government needs to continue with the 'hands off, eyes on' policy it has practised so far."

Earlier this month, the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes said the relaxation needed to be "reconsidered".

Despite its widespread practice and extensive documentation by groups like Survival International, which works for tribal peoples' rights, two major tour operators the BBC spoke to denied any instance of tribal tourism in the islands.

"I have never had anyone inquire about tribal tourism," said M Vinod, the president of the Andaman Association of Tour Operators, which represents 102 of 176 registered tourism firms in the islands.

"Police security is high and movements are strictly regulated while passing through tribal reserves."

The killing of the US national, he adds, was only a case of a "security lapse".

"The relaxation of RAPs is a good move for tourism," he says. And his stand on including islands like North Sentinel?

"It's up to the government to decide which islands it wants to promote."

THE COUNTRY WHERE 96% OF HOMES ARE PRIVATELY OWNED

Baby boomers: A home as cheap as a TV

In 1990, at the end of Romanian communist rule, the state owned 70% of apartments, says Bogdan Suditu, urban planning expert and Bucharest University professor. Once the government began to sell these properties, people rushed to buy the homes they were living in – often at very advantageous prices. Romania’s devalued currency, paired with growing inflation, made purchasing easy for these baby boomers.

“Paying 100,000 lei for an apartment in 1991 was a fair price at the time. In 1994, that was the price of a colour TV,” Suditu says.

Not only was housing more affordable, but the Romanian government also built fewer public housing units after 1996. Buying a private property became a more popular option by default.

BELIZE’S THRIVING AFRO-CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY

The boats came at dawn along the shores of the town of Dangriga on the coast of Belize.

Onboard, vibrantly dressed men, women and children carried homemade flags and waved bright green fronds of coconut palm branches as they approached the shore. On land, a crowd waited, ready to cheer as feet stepped out of the boats to touch sand.

We were never enslaved – that is a point of pride for the Garifuna people

On a similar morning in 1832, the Garifuna people – descendants of Carib, Arawak and West African people – made the same journey from St Vincent Island in the Caribbean, finally able to call Belize home after being turned away by the British government three times. Every year on 19 November, the Garifuna celebrate Garifuna Settlement Day, marking their arrival in Belize (which was then a British colony) and their many contributions to the Belizean landscape.

With this re-enactment of the boat landing, as well as oral history intoned by village elders and music, dancing and food, the national holiday attracts visitors from throughout Belize and the world. It immerses them in why the culture is so unique – and why its people are fighting to keep their heritage alive in an increasingly modern world.

Ask most Garifuna people and historians about the creation of the Garifuna people, and the common story is that West Africans on their way to the New World’s slave markets escaped after two ships wrecked in 1635. Of the hundreds of slaves, those who managed to survive swam to the Caribbean island of St Vincent where they were welcomed by the Carib and Arawak people and created a distinct culture of food, music, dance and language.

However, the Garifuna American Heritage Foundation in Los Angeles suggests Mali Empire Africans may have arrived on the island as early as the 1200s and the shipwrecks just added to the population. Other historians say the shipwreck story is the result of centuries of oral storytelling and that St Vincent wasn’t even near any regular slave trade routes. Whatever the truth, the shipwreck belief remains the ‘accepted’ history for the majority of Garifuna people.

“We were never enslaved,” said H Gilbert Swaso, former mayor of Dangriga and historian of the Garifuna culture. “That is a point of pride for the Garifuna people.”

A 1660 British peace treaty granted ‘perpetual possession’ of the Caribbean island of St Vincent to the Garifuna, but less than 10 years later broke the treaty and reclaimed the island. In 1796, after years of raids and skirmishes with the British, the Garifuna – who were by then the dominant population on the island after generations of intermarrying with the islanders – were defeated, then deported and marooned on the Spanish-owned Honduran island of Roatán.

Despite being left on a strange shore, they again flourished, and again they were persecuted. Following a republican revolt in Honduras in 1821, the Garifuna took flight once more, and in 1832, arrived on the Belize coast. They embraced their new home with optimism.

“The Garifuna requested to settle in Belize and were turned away three times,” Swaso said. “At some point, the government admitted the Garifuna to Belize, but they had to stay away from the main cities, and if they did enter the city, they needed a pass. So, the Garifuna settled south, and one of the largest settlements was in Dangriga and then Punta Gorda.”

The fight to have the Garifuna culture recognised officially by the Belize government wasn’t easy. Even though they were accepted into the country, the Garifuna were discriminated against and fought to keep their heritage. The Garifuna language, which comes from the Arawak and Carib languages of their island ancestors, was discouraged in schools, and their spirituality was condemned by churches.

“When the Garifuna suffered spiritual discrimination by the Roman Catholics [which was then Belize’s dominant religion], we incorporated some of their saints into our religion and survived,” Swaso said. “When we were discriminated from entering cities, we created our own cities. When we were discriminated against in schools, we became teachers and lawyers and doctors. We will accommodate and change what is necessary for us to survive without sacrificing our culture.”

Today, the global population of Garifuna is about 300,000, with many found in Belize and Honduras as well as parts of Guatemala and Nicaragua. According to a 2010 census report published by The Statistical Institute of Belize, of the county’s total population of around 324,500, an estimated 6.1% are Garifuna. Today, the Garifuna are accepted and celebrated in Belize and are involved in every aspect of life, serving as teachers, doctors, government officials and business owners. The first official celebration of Settlement Day was in 1941 in the Stann Creek district, according to Swaso. Two years later, in 1943, Punta Gorda, located 167km south, was also granted the holiday. And in 1977, Garifuna Settlement Day officially became a public holiday throughout Belize. Honduras has a similar celebration that is celebrated on 12 April, the date the Garifuna were marooned on Roatán.

On this day in Belize, Swaso explained that the re-enactment of the boat landing is followed by a special mass attended only by the Garifuna and high-ranking government officials.

Then, the party starts.

Hands pound on the drums and hips snap like scarves to the thumping paranda and punta rhythms – a blend of Caribbean and African beats – while the eateries serve up traditional dishes like cow foot soup and hudut (a coconut milk stew made with beaten plantains and vegetables like okra).

“We are a very visual people, and we have floats depicting the culture with drumming and music,” Swaso told me. “Once the parade is over, the streets become a carnival with food, crafts, different drinks and things like that. There is a lot of music and dancing and festivities.”

The colourful costumes and traditional dance have turned Settlement Day into a ‘mini-Rio’, and the celebrations often continue into the next day. Thousands of people flood into the Garifuna towns from districts all over Belize and the world, making it one of the country’s biggest international events.

It’s also the perfect time to taste dishes found only in the Garifuna culture, which are as much of a draw as the pageantry.

“Our food is very different from the rest of Belize,” Swaso said. “Our food is organic, clean. Hudut is one of our main dishes, prepared using organic ingredients like ripe and green plantains that are boiled and then beaten and then mixed together. We grate fresh coconut to make a gravy, and it’s spiced with basil, oregano and okra. Everything comes from the land or the sea – that is how the Garifuna eat, by and large.”

He explained that Garifuna still use traditional fishing and farming methods put in place by ancestors, like line fishing or diving for rock lobsters (only harvesting the mature ones). Plantains are still beaten by hand, and cassava bread is prepared in much the same way as the Garifuna women did it hundreds of years ago.

For Swaso, that simplicity and respect for nature gives the cuisine – which draws from local crops like cassava and plantains – its distinct flavour and personality.

Swaso, as well as many others, have a personal mission to pass on the Garifuna culture to children and outsiders. To help keep his heritage alive he hosts cultural music and dance classes, speaks on the history of his people and pushes for Garifuna to be taught in schools.

There is not going to be an end to anything – we evolve

But Swaso is worried that the Garifuna language, like so many other ethnic languages, will disappear. Despite Unesco proclaiming it (as well as Garifuna music and dance) to be among the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001, most young people don’t speak the tongue, preferring to speak Caribbean Creole, Spanish and English instead.

“While it appears we are losing our culture, different aspects of our culture will always remain,” Swaso said. “There is not going to be an end to anything. We evolve. It will allow us to continue to live our traditional way of life.”

EYE-OPENING SOVIET PHOTOS

On 2 May 1945, three soldiers and a photographer from the Red Army climbed onto the roof of the Reichstag in Berlin, a city they had just liberated from the Nazis. One soldier scrambled up a small tower, lifting aloft what appeared to be a Soviet flag. Behind him, eerie silhouettes of German heroes sculpted from stone took perpetual strides over the edge. The image taken in that moment went on to become a classic of war photography – and an interesting lesson in the blurred lines between truth and history.

Yevgeny Khaldei’s Banner of Victory appears in a new exhibition, Masterpieces of Soviet photography, at the Atlas Gallery in London. “It has such a great story attached to it, and a sense of mystery as well,” Atlas co-founder Ben Burdett tells BBC Culture. “It was a staged image – but staged for good reasons, because on the occasion when the banner was first raised, there wasn’t a photographer to capture the event. So the photographer went back the next day with the soldiers and restaged it because they wanted to have pictures of the Soviet banner over the Reichstag.”

More like this:

- The story of a painting that fought fascism

- Can propaganda be great art?

- The early Soviet images that foreshadowed fake news

Lacking a banner, the soldiers carried a piece of fabric later said to have been stitched together from three red tablecloths by the uncle of the photographer, with the hammer and sickle sewn on. According to the New York Times, Khaldei’s father and sisters had been killed by the Nazis – after seeing the photo of the Iwo-Jima flag raising taken by Joe Rosenthal just over two months earlier, he asked his uncle to create the makeshift flag and took it to Berlin so he could craft his own version of the iconic image.

It’s similar to Robert Capa’s dying solder, it’s the Russian version of it in a way – it’s a classic war picture – Ben Burdett

“That became one of the most historic pictures of the war,” says Burdett. “And later, it emerged that at the time the soldiers had taken valuables from dead Germans, and the man in the foreground of the photo was wearing looted watches on his wrists. Subsequently, the Russian authorities decided it wasn’t what they wanted to be seen because it showed the soldiers taking valuables off the German soldiers. Later versions of the image were retouched: there is one version that shows the soldier with three watches – two on one wrist and one on the other – but most of those in circulation just have him wearing one watch, or none. It’s similar to Robert Capa’s dying solder, it’s the Russian version of it in a way – it’s a classic war picture.”

Reality bites

The photograph represents the ambiguity that threads together the other images in the exhibition, which are all drawn from the personal collection of the 95-year-old photographer Lev Borodulin. They stridently proclaim a strong Soviet Union – and simultaneously suggest nuances through experimental techniques. “Sometimes there is a first impression before a completely different picture is revealed when you know its history,” exhibition co-curator Maya Katznelson tells BBC Culture. “Soviet photographers produced real masterworks while creating the grandiose myth of Soviet civilisation. I think their activities are akin to heroism. To make, on the one hand, ideologically correct photographs, and on the other, within the narrow limits allowed, to seek maximum artistic expression.”

“Borodulin was a Soviet-era photographer himself, who took a lot of now well-known images of the 1950s to 1970s living in Soviet Russia – predominantly sporting events, anything athletic and generally heroic,” says Burdett. Driven by what Atlas describes as a “quest to collect and preserve images from a time when art was restricted to serve a Soviet socialist agenda”, Borodulin has amassed a collection over the past 70 years that contains around 10,000 images. It largely spans a period from the Russian Revolution to the 1960s, with photos gathered from magazines, archives and picture agencies like TASS.

“This collection saved many photographs from destruction, it was one of the first collections of Soviet photography,” says Katznelson. While covering a range of periods, for her the images from World War Two are particularly striking. “The time, when on the verge of life and death, photojournalists created masterpieces. Some of this work served to lift the spirit of the whole country; some has been hidden in the archives for a long time, and not seen the light for tens of years after the end of the war.”

Borodulin finds special meaning in those images. “For me it is a very personal matter,” he tells BBC Culture from his home in Tel Aviv. “Many of my relatives were killed, if not all of them, I was injured twice, I was in the detachment that fought from Moscow to Berlin. It changed my life and the life of the country, and it changed the lives of all the people I knew. And I want people not to forget about it.” When Khaldei captured the fall of Berlin in his photo, there was still crossfire at the Reichstag: according to Borodulin, Khaldei risked his life to create the image. They later became close. “Khaldei was my personal friend, we spent many hours together remembering the war… and each time I came to the small photographic studio where he was living I saw this image, probably one metre wide by size, and we sat in front of it.”

The collection offers a different way into Russian history. “It’s vast, covering the whole of the Stalin era, the whole of the Soviet period, World War Two, the Cold War and beyond,” says Burdett. “Some were taken in the darkest years of the Stalin era – from a historical point of view they represent an amazing resource for seeing the development and construction of modern Russia, particularly through heavy industry and agriculture.”

But Burdett and Katznelson were particularly drawn to another aspect of the collection, beyond historical record. “We were more interested in the development of the aesthetic of Soviet photography, and the artistic approach: the Constructivists, the October Group – the Russian equivalent to the Bauhaus,” says Burdett. “We were picking out works by masters of the medium such as Arkady Shaikhet, Yakov Khalip, Alexander Rodchenko and Boris Ignatovich.”

One central element of this Soviet aesthetic was dictated by the political landscape in which the photographers were working. “A common characteristic of a lot of the pictures is this rather fake triumphant exuberance that the photographers tried to capture in the faces of the people that they photographed. It’s a very obvious aspect of the images, that they have this propaganda element. It’s an aesthetic that’s become quite fashionable because it’s odd – it’s very melodramatic.”

But there’s another key element in Soviet photography that is far removed from the triumphal expressions of a powerful state. “In many ways, what characterises it is a degree of experimentation and improvisation which you don’t see in the West,” says Burdett. “Russian photographers developed this distinct view of photography which involved different approaches like unusual cropping and camera angles – a lot of the time the angles are diagonally framed rather than square; they’re looking up or down at subjects rather than straight on; they use photo montage and collage a lot.”

The Constructivists “identified themselves with the political revolution as innovative artists, and intended to build a new world with the means of new art”, according to Katznelson. The October Group radically changed the press. “For ten years – 1925-1935 – Soviet press photography was the most avant-garde in the world.”

Even when the avant-garde fell out of favour, photographers were pushing boundaries. According to Katznelson, “it was a time of ‘socialist realism’ – realistic in form and socialist in content… [and] the portrait was supposed to radiate optimism, the will to win and strength of mind”.

The demands of propaganda in a way encouraged experimentation, argues Burdett. “Photographers were challenged to create work that looked triumphant and positive, so a lot of the photography shows life in a very dramatic light – part of that comes from using these unusual angles. Looking up or down at subjects gives a dramatic view of what’s going on in the pictures.”

Through Soviet photography you can trace not only the history of the country, but also the change of ideological priorities – Maya Katznelson

“Through Soviet photography you can trace not only the history of the country, but also the change of ideological priorities. What to shoot and how to shoot,” argues Katznelson. Even by the 1960s, an age of liberation still had its restrictions, as Borodulin recalls when asked which of his own photos he particularly likes. “Probably one of my favourites is a photograph which was censored as ‘flying ass’, of the diver. I took it at my first Olympic games in 1960 in Rome and that was the first time I went to a ‘capitalist’ country. I was so happy to do this, I was just starting my career as a photographer at Ogoniok magazine… and it was chosen to be the cover.”

Yet it received criticism from Mikhail Suslov, the unofficial Chief Ideologue of the Communist Party, who wrote in Pravda, Borodulin remembers, “that it’s not good for Ogoniok to publish this type of photo, because it’s too avant-garde and too formalistic”. Despite that, he took it as praise. “In this small article I was called a master, they say ‘it’s not fitting for such a big master of photography as Lev Borodulin to take this type of picture’.”

The most recent photo in the exhibition reveals how Russian society had evolved since the 1920s – and how this collection can offer a different perspective on history. “What distinguishes it from a similar collection of works of a similar period from the US, from Life Magazine, or from Europe in the Picture Post is that there aren’t any pictures of celebrities,” says Burdett.

“There were no pictures of Marilyn Monroe, or Elvis – there was no celebrity culture. Until you get to this amazing picture of Yuri Gagarin in 1961. It was almost not until that point that Russia had a celebrity, in the modern sense – he was the first one. He was extremely handsome and heroic looking, and the first man in space, so he became this celebrity hero figure in Russia – and that’s 1961 which is quite late in the development of popular culture worldwide. That’s almost the latest image in the collection, in a way it forms the end of an era.”

Masterpieces of Soviet Photography is at the Atlas Gallery in London until 27 November 2018.

WHY ‘FLAMMABLE ICE’ COULD BE THE FUTURE OF ENERGY

Buried below the seabed around Japan, there are beds of methane, trapped in molecular cages of ice. In some places, the sediment covering these deposits of frozen water and methane has been eroded away, leaving whitish mounts of what looks like dirty ice rearing up out of the seafloor.

Put a match to this sea ice and it doesn’t just melt, it ignites

Take a chunk of this stuff up to the surface and it looks and feels much like ice, except for a give-away fizzing sensation in the palm of your hand, but put a match to it and it doesn’t just melt, it ignites. Large international research programmes and companies in Japan, among other countries, are racing to retrieve this strange, counter-intuitive substance – known as fiery ice – from beneath the seafloor to use its methane for fuel. If all goes to plan, they may even start extraction by the end of the next decade. But the journey so far has been far from smooth.

There’s no doubt that methane hydrates could offer a major source of fuel, with recent estimates suggesting they constitute about a third of the total carbon held in other fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. Several nations, notably Japan, want to extract it. It is not hard to find, often leaving a characteristic seismic signature that can be detected by research vessels. The problem is retrieving that gas and bringing it to the surface.

“One thing that’s clear is that we’re never going to go down and mine these ice-like deposits,” says Carolyn Ruppel, who leads the US Geological Survey’s Gas Hydrates Project.

If you like this, you may also enjoy:

It all comes down to physics. Methane hydrates are simply too sensitive to pressure and temperature to simply dig up and haul to land. They form at typically several hundred metres beneath the seafloor at water depths of about 500 metres, where pressures are much higher than at the surface, and temperatures are close to 0C. Take them out of these conditions, and they begin to break down before the methane can be harnessed. But there are other ways to do it.

“Instead, you have to force those deposits to release the methane from the formation in the seafloor. Then you can extract the gas that comes off,” says Ruppel.

A Japanese government funded research programme is trying to do just that. Its initial mission, after several years of preliminary research scoping out likely spots for methane hydrates, was in 2013. “It was a world-first,” says Koji Yamamoto, director general of the methane hydrate research and development group at the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation, and one of the leading researchers in Japan’s national gas hydrates research programme.

The team managed to produce gas from the methane hydrate reserves by drilling a borehole down into the seabed of the Nankai Trough, off the eastern coast of Japan’s main island. By lowering the pressure on the reserves, they were able to release and collect the gas. The test ran for six days, before sand entered the well and blocked the supply.

A second test in 2017 ran in the Nankai Trough. This time the researchers used two test wells. The first encountered the same problem as before and became blocked with sand after several days. But the second of the well ran for 24 days without technical problems, Yamamoto says.

In general, people just feel really scared to do anything to the ocean floor. The place is known to be unstable and earthquakes happen – Ai Oyama

Even though the tests ran for a short time, they showed that there was a glimmer of potential that Japan might have usable carbon-based natural resources. The public reaction, however, was mixed, says Ai Oyama, a technical translator and former research analyst working on methane hydrates at the Hawai’i Natural Energy Institute. Some welcomed the idea that Japan may have energy independence. Others were very wary about any technique that disturbed the seafloor near tectonic plate boundaries.

“In general, people just feel really scared to do anything to the ocean floor. The place is known to be unstable and earthquakes happen,” Oyama says.

The fear is that depressurising one part of the methane hydrate deposit might make the whole reserve become unstable.

“People worry that we’ll start extracting methane from the gas hydrates and get into a runaway breakdown where we can’t stop it,” says Ruppel.

The problem with this would be two-fold. First, a lot of methane gas would suddenly be released into the ocean – which could potentially add vast amounts of the greenhouse gas to the atmosphere.

Second, methane hydrate releases a lot of water as well as a lot of methane when it destabilises, which would introduce a lot more liquid into the sediment below the ocean floor. In a steeply sloping environment, a lot of excess water could lead to landslips. Some environmentalists even fear that it could lead to a tsunami.

However, the physical properties of methane hydrate put a natural brake on this chain of events, says Ruppel. To release methane from a deposit, you have to put energy into the system. Without working hard to release the gas – through lowering the pressure or raising the temperature of the deposit – it simply stays put in its stable form of methane hydrate.

“So the problem is actually the opposite. You may start the process of getting the gas to come off, but to keep that process going, you have to introduce more energy to make it happen,” says Ruppel.

While a runaway reaction isn’t likely, the Japanese programme is still carrying out extensive environmental studies to test the safety of the methane hydrate production. The data gathered at the first test in 2013, and at a second longer test in 2017, so far hasn’t suggested that the technique will destabilise the ocean floor, Yamamoto says. But given Japan’s history of natural disasters – around 24,000 people are still under evacuation order since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami – the public is highly risk-averse.

“We feel that gas hydrate production is environmentally safe,” says Yamamoto. “But still, [the public] have a concern about negative effects of gas hydrate production.”

As well as the reserves buried beneath the sea floor, there is another type of methane hydrate deposit that has been gaining attention from Japanese researchers. Efforts to research shallower deposits, very close to the seafloor surface, is also being explored off in the Sea of Japan to the west of the country. Accessing these shallow reserves poses a very different potential risk.

“These are very active biological environments,” says Tim Collett, a senior scientist at the US Geological Survey’s Gas Hydrate Project. “There are whole communities that live off the methane.”

These environments are rich in unique organisms, from bacteria to very large tubeworms and crabs, all specialised to live off the methane as their source of energy. In other parts of the world where these methane-based communities live, they are often protected as rare natural environments.

Beneath the permafrost

Japan’s main efforts in extracting methane hydrate, however are not in the seafloor at all, but in the only other place that flammable ice can found – deep in the permafrost, the permanently-frozen layer of rock or soil that covers the ground at polar regions and high-rise mountains. Researchers from Japan, which doesn’t have its own permafrost, are assisting in the most ambitious on-land production test for methane hydrate so far, in Alaska’s North Slope.

In December, researchers from Japan’s national research programme are set to start work with the US Geological Survey and the US’s Department of Energy, to begin what they hope will be a long-term production test site. While this source of methane hydrate is very different, the methods used to get to it are actually very close.

“The conditions at those reservoirs under the permafrost are pretty similar pressure and temperature conditions as they are in the Nankai Trough,” says Collett. “It turns out, to the best of our knowledge, even though the Arctic and the marine environment are very different, the physical properties of the deposits and how they occur in the sediments appears to be very similar.”

The production techniques used in Alaska could end up being transferrable to the marine environment. But there are still big challenges. A long-term production of methane hydrates hasn’t been carried out anywhere yet, on land or under the sea.

“We’re still very much in research mode,” says Collett.

Given the difficulty of retrieving gas from methane hydrate reserves, and the concerns around extraction, the stakes have to be high for a nation to invest heavily in this technology. Having very few other options in terms of domestic energy makes this hard-to-access source of methane an appealing prospect. Japan is not a country that has other carbon-based sources of energy to fall back on.

“Japan imports a lot of natural gas, but it is very costly. If we have our own domestic resource, [it could] contribute to the energy security of Japan,” says Yamamoto.

As an economic resource, it’s easy to see the appeal of methane hydrate. But, fundamentally, it is just another source of natural gas and burning it would contribute to climate change.

All the social and environmental issues associated with fossil fuels apply to gas hydrates

“The most important thing is the recognition and appreciation that gas hydrates are just another fossil fuel,” says Collett. “All the social and environmental issues associated with fossil fuels apply to gas hydrates.”

In this context, methane hydrates – if they are to play a role in Japan’s energy future – are likely to be used as a bridging fuel, in the transition towards renewables. Natural gas is the least carbon-intensive form of fossil fuel, releasing less carbon dioxide per unit of energy released than coal or oil. But, as a carbon-based fuel, burning it still contributes to climate change.

“We need to shift to renewable energy,” says Koji Yamamoto. “But complete switch to renewable energy [takes] a very long time.”

Even as a transition fuel, gas hydrates could be hugely important, Ruppel says. “Were a country able to efficiently produce methane from these deposits, it could open a new realm in bridge fuels to another energy future,” she says.

How useful a role it can play in the future depends on how quickly methane hydrate can be accessed and produced on a commercial scale. The Japanese government hopes to begin commercial projects exploring methane hydrate between 2023 and 2027, according to its latest Strategic Energy Plan.

This target could be a bit ambitious. Jun Matsushima, a researcher at the Frontier Research Center for Energy and Resources at the University of Tokyo, puts the estimate at around 2030 to 2050. “There is a long way to commercialise methane hydrate,” says Matsushima.

The make-or-break moment will be when a long-term production test can be sustained without technical problems or budget constraints shutting it down, says Ruppel.

“I would guess there will be a long-term production test – from months to more than a year – by 2025. But I don’t have a crystal ball,” Ruppel says.

But at the same time, Japan is committing to moving towards renewable energies and decarbonisation. As technologies for harnessing renewable energy become better and cheaper, the role for fossil fuels – especially experimental and expensive ones like methane hydrate – decreases. The longer it takes to get methane from gas hydrate reserves on a commercial scale, the shorter the useful window for using it may be. The other possibility is that adding in a new accessible source of fossil fuel could delay the transition to renewables, says Collett.

This source of carbon, the most abundant in the world, may be one of the last new forms of fossil fuel to be extracted on a commercial scale. It is also the only one to be developed with the end of fossil fuels in sight. The race for methane hydrates is a unique one, where researchers are working towards a goal that might be made irrelevant by renewables by the time they reach it.

For this reason, methane hydrates may well have a shelf life, but it remains to be seen whether Japan, and other countries pursuing them, will be able to get to them on a sufficiently large scale before they’ve already become expendable.

HOW 'PLAYING PURI' PAVED THE WAY FOR SNAPCHAT

Here to stay

As smartphone camera technology has advanced, social mobile apps like Snapchat and Instagram have increasingly added features that seem to have been inspired by Japan’s Purikura machines – first by letting users scribble graffiti or type text over selfies, then by adding features that “beautify” the final image in some way. At Calla Lil in Shibuya, one of the more popular photo editing options are cat whiskers or bunny ears users can add to their photographs, just like on Snapchat.

It makes sense that Japan’s original Snapchat would now be looking for cues from the popular mobile apps it inspired. In 2009, Atlus left the Purikura booth business, as better software and better cameras made the machines vastly more expensive to develop and produce. Japan’s Furyu Corp., which entered the Purikura business in 1998, maintains a leading position in the market for modern booths, selling $219 million worth of machines and sticker supplies in the financial year 2017.

The key to success, however, is not necessarily having the best software, but having the best available market research on what today’s generation of young Japanese women find “kawaii,” or “cute.”

“The pixel count of the photos and the number of colours available aren’t what makes a booth profitable,” a company spokesperson said. “Whether or not it can take a cute photograph is all people care about.”

JOURNALIST EXPERTISE

BBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism.

General news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines.

Article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found.

TYPE OF WORK

BBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories:

News - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources

REALITY CHECK: BREXIT WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT

Image copyright Getty Images

The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 585 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union, scheduled for 29 March 2019.

Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.

Transition

The transition period (which the UK government calls "implementation period") begins on 29 March 2019 and lasts until 31 December 2020.

The UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions.

The draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but this can only happen once and for a limited period.

Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension and the decision must be taken before 1 July 2020.

Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice.

The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.

Money

The draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or "divorce bill") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations.

While no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least £39bn and it will be paid over a number of years.

Part of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. This year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net £10.8bn.

If the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately.

Chris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the "divorce bill" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible.

Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.

Citizens' rights

This is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March.

UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit.

Citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition.

Anyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence.

Chris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty.

British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders in the future, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now, are also unresolved issues.

Northern Ireland/the backstop

If no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of "a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom" will be triggered.

Northern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market.

As long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to "level playing field conditions", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory.

The UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU.

Chris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods.

That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations.

Fishing

The agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters.

The document says: "The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities."

Chris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.

It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.

Laws and disputes

The UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition.

A joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement.

If the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly.

Instead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision.

Chris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over.

That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.

What else is in it?

Elsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus.

There's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled.

EU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like "Welsh Lamb" or "Parma Ham" remain.

Alongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.

REALITY CHECK: CAN YOU BE 'EMPLOYED' FOR ONE HOUR'S WORK?

Just how many hours do you need to work to be officially classified as "employed"?

Steve Garner, a sociologist, recently tweeted about how his son had repeatedly turned up to work at a warehouse only to be regularly told he wasn't needed.

This is is how employment figures are made to look impressive. — Frodo Chewhan (@FrodoChewhan) November 18, 2018 Report

BBC Reality Check asked the Office for National Statistics (ONS) whether working just one hour a week was all that was needed to be officially classified as employed?

The ONS confirmed that was the case.

Every three months, a large survey (known as the Labour Force Survey) is sent to approximately 90,000 people, selected at random. The ONS extrapolates the findings to produce employment bulletins.

Those selected to take part in the LFS are interviewed every three months for fifteen months before they drop out of the sample. Interviews are initially done face-to-face and follow-up ones are done by phone. The one exception is the north of Scotland where all interviews are done over the phone because of the distance involved.

A person will need to have worked at least one hour in the week before the interview with the ONS takes place to be classified as employed.

Its most recent survey put the UK employment rate (of people aged 16-64) at 75.5% - very close to a record high.

The figures were welcomed by government, with Employment Minister Alok Sharma saying: "The benefits of a strong jobs market are paying off."

But could people working very few hours be artificially boosting the headline employment numbers to make them look better than they really are?

The ONS told Reality Check that was unlikely because the overall number of people working so few hours "is very low indeed".

That is supported by its own figures.

The ONS data shows that the number of people usually working six hours or fewer a week is just 1.4% of the UK working population - or just over 400,000 people, which compares with a total of 32.4 million people in work.

In fact, that's a drop from 1.8% at the start of the century.

So, the share of people working very short hours has actually fallen, which suggests zero-hour contracts are not distorting the headline employment numbers.

But why does the ONS use one hour as the definition?

Choosing whether to define someone as being in employment or not can be a bit of a conundrum, says Tony Wilson, director at the Institute for Employment Studies.

"Why pick one hour? Well, because if you put the bar higher, you might end up classifying people as unemployed even though they're working."

"You have to draw the line somewhere," he says.

The ONS definition is also an international one - drawn up by the International Labour Organization (ILO). By choosing to use the ILO's definition, the UK's employment data is consistent with other countries, making it easier to draw international comparisons.

UPDATE 21 November: The ONS initially told Reality Check that the criteria to be counted as "employed" was one hour over two weeks. It subsequently told us that it had made an error and that the definition was in fact one hour over one week.

WHY IS THE UAE'S LEGAL SYSTEM BEING CRITICISED?

Image copyright Daniela Tejada Image caption Matthew Hedges was detained at Dubai Airport in May

The treatment of a British academic jailed for life in the United Arab Emirates has been widely criticised by British politicians and human rights organisations.

Matthew Hedges was sentenced in a court in Abu Dhabi for spying.

His wife says there was no due process and the evidence against him was unfounded.

The UAE Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi said Mr Hedges had "confessed in detail to his crimes" and was "accorded full rights" with a "fair and transparent trial".

How was Mr Hedges' trial conducted?

In the UAE defendants have the right to a lawyer at the time of trial, says Hiba Zayadin of Human Rights Watch, but not during pre-trial detention.

According to the UAE foreign ministry, Mr Hedges accepted the services of a court-appointed lawyer in the first court session on 3 October.

A ministry statement said the case against Mr Hedges was thoroughly investigated by the public prosecutor and "compelling and powerful evidence was presented in court."

The trial on 21 November reportedly lasted just a few minutes. But, according to the foreign ministry, this is common because the court session was only to announce a verdict and deliver a sentence. The court, said the ministry, had met previously.

Mr Hedge's wife, Daniela Tejada, said he had been kept in solitary confinement for weeks without access to legal help.

During that period, his family says he signed what transpired to be a confession in Arabic. Mr Hedges, according to his family, does not speak or read Arabic.

Legal documents in the UAE are required to be in Arabic, says Abdul Khaleq Abdullah, an academic based in the UAE.

"When [these documents are] presented to someone who doesn't speak Arabic, there is a translator who explains it word by word."

"Yes he signed an Arabic document because this is the law of the land here, but he was given the full right to a translation."

Ms Zayadin says these rights are not always observed, and the quality of translation services can vary.

The importance of a confession

Ms Zayadin says the charges against Mr Hedges seem to have been largely based on a confession.

She says it is common in Gulf countries for a confession to be the main grounds on which a guilty verdict is delivered, particularly in state security cases such as this.

But these, she says, can be problematic.

Human Rights Watch has documented many allegations in the region of confessions which have been forcibly obtained without the presence of a lawyer, and defendants denied legal counsel or access to family members.

What are the wider criticisms of the UAE's legal system?

When a senior UN official investigated the UAE's judicial system in 2014, she found serious shortcomings.

In her report, Gabriela Knaul - the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers - said she had found reports of "serious breaches of fair trial and due process guarantees."

The report also noted instances where "judges appear to have lacked impartiality and shown bias, especially with regard to non-nationals of the United Arab Emirates."

Difficulties with the use of translators in the UAE have also been noted by the UN. The Special Rapporteur found that translations and interpretation in court cases involving non-Arabic speakers, required by law, "were not always provided in practice, or that their quality was poor."

Radha Stirling from Detained in Dubai, an organisation which has provided representation for foreign nationals in the UAE, says signing a confession without a translator in the UAE is "standard practice."

Accusations alone, with "zero evidence", can be enough to secure prosecution, she says.

In response to the criticisms levelled at the UAE, the justice ministry said the constitution guaranteed an independent judiciary and that the country was committed to strengthening human rights.

BREXIT: WHAT'S IN THE POLITICAL DECLARATION?

Image copyright Getty Images

The draft political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and the UK, after Brexit, is out. Theresa May describes it as the right deal for the UK.

A few points to remember…

This is not a legally binding document.

It's not very long either, but it has grown from last week's seven-page outline to 26 pages. It sits alongside the 585-page Draft Withdrawal Agreement (which will be legally binding if it gets ratified).

This is also a draft, agreed by negotiators, but it still needs to be approved by the leaders of all 28 EU countries at a summit scheduled to take place on Sunday. Don't expect major changes.

Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened - currently after 29 March 2019.

It contains plenty of aspirations involving shared interests, close partnerships and ambitious co-operation, but many of the details are still to come.

Here's an initial look at what's in the text:

Future relationship

A reminder that this really is about everything, not just about trade: the entire scope of the future relationship between the UK and its nearest neighbours.

Both sides want that relationship to be as close and co-operative as possible but that aspiration will be tested in the years ahead.

Again, it's worth emphasising that this is not a legally binding document, so there are no guarantees about what the post-Brexit world will look like.

And no-one can say for certain how long it will all take to negotiate.

Bottom lines

The bottom line of both parties is included early on.

Anything that is negotiated must be consistent with the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.

And nothing will be agreed that threatens the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.

As we've seen for months now, the issue of the Irish border is where the combination of these core principles becomes most complicated.

Trade in goods

So trade in goods should be "as close as possible", but that's not the same as being frictionless.

It leaves a lot of wiggle room in negotiations, with no guarantee of the final outcome.

The two sides are committing themselves to an "ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced" economic partnership, based on a comprehensive free trade agreement.

But there is also repeated emphasis that there must be a level playing field, which ensures open and fair competition.

The more economic rights you retain, the EU is reminding the UK, the more obligations to which you have to sign up.

Customs

When the outline of this draft emerged last week, this was a notion that raised alarm bells for many supporters of Brexit.

Dominic Raab mentioned it in his resignation statement. Their fear, which will not be dispelled by this draft text, is that temporary customs arrangements could easily turn into some form of permanent customs union, preventing the UK from doing its own trade deals on goods around the world.

The government denies this, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future, including the need to avoid checks on what are known as "rules of origin".

The declaration also mentions explicitly an "independent trade policy" for the UK in the future.

Irish border

We are, this emphasises, open to any solution that will avoid the proposed backstop solution, to keep the Irish border open.

That includes technological and other solutions that critics of the Brexit negotiations say have been ignored for too long.

The trouble is that technological solutions that avoid the need for any border infrastructure are not in operation anywhere in the world.

Regulations

UK officials see this as a key sentence, which suggests there is plenty of room for manoeuvre in the negotiations to come.

It makes clear, they argue, that it is not the case that the UK can only have either a basic free trade agreement (like Canada) or membership of the single market (like Norway), with nothing in-between.

But none of the language here commits the EU to anything specific.

Trade in services

As expected, the regulation of financial services will be based on a system of "equivalence" and the aim is to negotiate the details in this key sector before the end of June 2020.

There's nothing in the language here to suggest that the UK will get better terms than any other third country dealing with the EU - but that will be a key negotiating aim.

There are also plenty of aspirational words on "ambitious and comprehensive" plans for the service sector in general, but there is an awful lot to negotiate.

Digital commerce

There are plenty of nods towards the way the world economy is changing, and the importance of comprehensive agreements on data.

The UK hopes that in the negotiations to come, it can be well positioned to take advantage of new technologies and the digital economy.

But the EU has already made it clear that the UK cannot expect to have the same access to all EU databases - in various economic and security areas - as it would have as an EU member state.

Freedom of movement

This fulfils the Prime Minister's pledge that the UK will take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK will come to an end. But it means, of course, that free movement for UK citizens travelling to the EU will also stop.

The document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays.

Fishing rights

There is neutral language here, including the "best endeavours" principle that commits both sides to doing everything they can to reach a deal.

But that disguises the fact that there are still deep disagreements on fishing, and on getting the right balance between access for UK produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK fishing waters.

Expect this one to run and run, because the UK is not alone in having a vocal fishing lobby with more political power than its overall contribution to the economy might suggest.

Security

There is a lot in this document on security - both on internal police co-operation and on broader foreign policy and defence co-operation.

The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the draft makes clear that - on internal security matters in particular - there is a variety of legal and technical issues to overcome.

We can expect, though, that UK and EU foreign policy will be co-ordinated as closely as possible in the future.

Disputes and courts

Rather like the Draft Withdrawal Agreement, the political declaration envisages a system of dispute resolution involving a joint committee and an arbitration panel.

But once again, on matters of EU law (and there will be a lot of that involved in any future relationship) the final word will rest with the European Court of Justice.

The government will point out that after Brexit the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end.

Timing

There is a plethora of other issues in the draft document that this article hasn't covered: transport, energy, intellectual property and so on.

Both sides say they hope all these issues and more can be wrapped up by the end of 2020. It's an ambitious timetable.

CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES: IS TRUMP RIGHT WHEN HE BLAMES FOREST MANAGERS?

Image copyright Getty Images

President Trump has been pointing the finger at the way California manages its forests as the reason for the deadly wildfires that have swept across the state.

During a recent visit, he held up the example of Finland as a country that spends time "raking and cleaning" its forests to reduce the risk of fires.

He had already suggested that California was not managing its forests properly - despite receiving "billions of dollars" each year.

The California Professional Firefighters said the assertion forest management policy was to blame was "dangerously wrong".

The International Federation of Firefighters - which represents members across the US and Canada - attacked President Trump for suggesting he might cut off funding.

Some of those fighting the recent fires have also pointed out that fires have started in open scrub or grassland rather than in forests.

The comments have also been criticised by some experts who say they ignore the bigger picture of climate change and population shifts in the state.

What is the situation in Finland?

Finland has large forested areas - but Finns were not quite sure what President Trump was referring to when he talked about them "raking".

Prof Pekka Leskinen, of the European Forest Institute, told BBC News it could have been a misunderstanding during President Trump's conversation with his Finnish counterpart.

He says there are important differences between forests in Finland and those in California:

an extensive network of roads acting as firebreaks and giving quick access to emergency services

smaller individual forest holdings, sometimes separated by lakes and rivers

differences in types of trees and other vegetation, with those found in Finland less flammable

cooler conditions on average than the hot dry weather in California

Finland also benefits from a network of volunteers who make up an effective early warning system, thus enabling fires to be doused before they spread.

Who manages California's forest?

In California, nearly 60% of forested areas are managed by national agencies such as the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service.

And there's a significant amount in private hands as well.

The actual amount managed by the California state authorities is small - but the California Department of Fire and Forestry Protection is responsible for putting out fires and prevention measures in privately owned areas.

The national agencies have funds set aside for managing the land they own:

The US Forest Service has a budget of $4.73bn (£3.64bn) for 2018, of which $2.4bn is for "fire suppression and preparedness"

The Bureau of Land Management had a budget of $1.3bn in 2017, although it's not clear how much was for forest management or fire prevention

The National Park Service's anticipated budget for 2019 is $2.2bn, with $289.2m for "resource stewardship"

We don't know exactly what amounts are spent on measures to reduce fire risk on land they manage in California.

But concerns have been voiced about whether there's been enough emphasis on longer-term fire prevention.

Scott Stephens, a leading authority on wildfires at the University of California, has for some years been questioning forest management priorities.

He believes more focus needs to be put on more sensible management of the environment and better land use to avoid "catastrophic burning".

He has also pointed to the large number of dead trees in parts of the state, due to drought and disease, as a serious fire risk that needs to be addressed.

Tom Bonnicksen, professor of forest science at Texas A&M University, says the real issue is that there are too many trees in California's forests.

How could forests be managed differently?

Prof Stefan Doerr, at Swansea University, says the modern policy of putting out all fires in wild areas may have been misguided.

For centuries, Native American peoples would burn parts of the forest so they could hunt or gather plants that grow in the cleared areas and that would thin out the more flammable vegetation and make forests less dense.

"But in the recent century or so, the emphasis has been on putting out any fires - and with climate change this has now created a tinderbox of vegetation," Prof Doerr told BBC News.

The case for allowing controlled fires to clear out vegetation also applies to other types of landscape such grass and shrub land, according to another expert.

Is the problem getting worse?

There's little doubt fires have been getting worse in California in recent years, both in terms of their destructive power and their size.

All but one of the 10 biggest fires by area have taken place in the past two decades, according to the California Fire Service.

And in terms of loss of life and damage to property, the data shows the worst fires have all been in the past 10 years or so - except for one fire in 1991 in Alameda County.

Many experts point out that climate change has made things worse, leading to higher temperatures, lower humidity and changes in wind and rainfall patterns.

Drier, warmer conditions lead to vegetation drying out and becoming more flammable,.

Add to that the fact that winter seasons when it rains or snows are getting shorter.

California is also one of a number of US states where more and more people are moving out of the main urban centres and into rural or semi-rural areas.

A report by the US Department of Agriculture in 2010 noted that by that year more than 11 million people out of a population of some 37 million in California were living in such areas - and flagged the fire risks this posed.

Also, houses are often built of combustible materials such as wood.

California state law does require homeowners to take steps to protect their properties from fire hazards, including clearing or reducing vegetation near properties.

However, research by the Hoover Institute earlier this year raised concerns over public awareness, enforcement and the availability of up-to-date information about the areas at most risk.

There's little doubt that unless some of these issues are addressed, the costs to California - as well as to Washington - will grow.

REALITY CHECK: THE CUSTOMS UNION EXPLAINED

Video

One term that keeps cropping up in discussions around Brexit is the customs union. What is it and how does it work?

Reality Check's Chris Morris explains.
====== 103 ========
REALITY CHECK: BREXIT WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT

Image copyright Getty Images

The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 585 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union, scheduled for 29 March 2019.

Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.

Transition

The transition period (which the UK government calls "implementation period") begins on 29 March 2019 and lasts until 31 December 2020.

The UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions.

The draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but this can only happen once and for a limited period.

Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension and the decision must be taken before 1 July 2020.

Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice.

The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.

Money

The draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or "divorce bill") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations.

While no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least £39bn and it will be paid over a number of years.

Part of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. This year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net £10.8bn.

If the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately.

Chris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the "divorce bill" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible.

Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.

Citizens' rights

This is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March.

UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit.

Citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition.

Anyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence.

Chris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty.

British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders in the future, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now, are also unresolved issues.

Northern Ireland/the backstop

If no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of "a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom" will be triggered.

Northern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market.

As long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to "level playing field conditions", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory.

The UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU.

Chris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods.

That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations.

Fishing

The agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters.

The document says: "The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities."

Chris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.

It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.

Laws and disputes

The UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition.

A joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement.

If the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly.

Instead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision.

Chris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over.

That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.

What else is in it?

Elsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus.

There's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled.

EU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like "Welsh Lamb" or "Parma Ham" remain.

Alongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.

BREXIT: WHAT DO THERESA MAY’S TORY ENEMIES OBJECT TO IN THE DEAL?

Image copyright Getty Images

Theresa May's draft Brexit agreement has left some of her fellow Conservative MPs seething. There's a broad range of objection, but these are some of their key complaints.

For the Brexit faithful, it all comes down to control. Esther McVey, one of two senior members of the UK government to quit because of the proposed deal, did so because it fails to "regain control" from Brussels.

"Repeatedly you have said that we must regain control of our money, our borders and our laws and develop our own independent trade policy... This deal fails to do this," she wrote.

Her claim directly contrasts with what Theresa May said on Thursday: "This deal... brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union."

So what exactly are the objections and how does the government defend them?

Money

This year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net £10.8bn. It has agreed to continue paying similar amounts until the end of the "transition period" - the time after Brexit Day on 29 March 2019 that both sides have set aside to agree a trade deal.

The payments will form part of the "divorce settlement" - expected to be at least £39bn - which the UK has agreed to pay the EU to cover its financial obligations for leaving.

The transition period is due to end on the last day of December 2020, but it may not. The draft agreement leaves the option of it being extended - if a trade deal isn't sorted out. If the transition is extended, it can only happen once and for a limited period.

This means a previous commitment by Theresa May that any extension would be for a "matter of months", cannot be guaranteed, especially as the decision to extend the transition has to be taken jointly by the EU and the UK.

So if the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU which will be agreed separately.

However, supporters of the draft deal say once the UK leaves the transition period, its big annual payments will end. This is why the prime minister and her supporters claim the agreement allows the UK to regain control of its money.

Borders

During the transition period, freedom of movement rules apply, meaning EU citizens will be free to live and work in the UK and vice versa.

Once the UK exits transition, it will be able to set its own rules on immigration.

This is why the prime minster claims the UK will be "taking back control" of its borders and that the country will be ending free movement.

But if the transition period continues, so EU citizens will be able to carry on moving to the UK.

Laws

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the gremlin here for many Brexit believers. It has the final say on disputes between people and governments on matters of EU law. Its opponents say the last word should always be with a UK court.

Mrs May agrees. Two years ago she declared: "We are not leaving [the EU] only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen."

But during the transition, the UK will have to follow all EU rules and abide by ECJ rulings.

Opponents argue this leaves the UK as a rule taker and no longer a rule maker. And if the transition period is extended into a backstop, the ECJ's jurisdiction will also be extended.

But Mrs May's backers say the UK will be free of the ECJ once the transition is over.

Another objection, voiced by MP Mark Francois, is that under the agreement the UK has committed to keeping "equivalent standards" with the EU in employment, environmental and social policy. In effect, the UK "would continue to take EU law" says Mr Francois.

Furthermore, if the backstop is triggered then disputes about putting the agreement into practice will be settled by an arbitration panel, consisting of people nominated by both sides. That panel must refer any matter which concerns the interpretation of EU law to the ECJ

Independent trade policy

Once the UK exits transition, and assuming the backstop isn't triggered, it will be able to implement any agreed free trade deals it strikes with other countries.

If the transition period is extended, that is the backstop is introduced, free trade deals will have to wait.

And if the UK becomes a single customs territory, which is what would happen under the backstop, it won't be able to implement any deals on goods (but it will be able to do some deals it reaches on services).

Deciding when the backstop comes to an end, will not only be up to the UK. It will also have to be agreed with the EU. Ms McVey and likeminded enemies of the deal fear the UK could become "trapped" in this arrangement, limiting its ability to strike trade deals.

IS TEENAGE PREGNANCY IN KENYA REALLY ON THE RISE?

Image copyright AFP

A controversy is raging in Kenya about teenage pregnancy.

The debate was sparked following comments made by Education Secretary Amina Mohamed, who said that a "high number of candidates became mothers" during three days of the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exams - sat by pupils normally aged 13 or 14.

She said: "If this is happening all-year round, the country could be facing a real crisis."

This has led to debates online and on radio and television, and sparked a wave of media reports from around the country.

Reality Check has investigated the available data on teenage pregnancy to see whether it is in fact on the rise in Kenya.

We have also uncovered one widely-shared post on social media that has perpetuated a false claim of girls breastfeeding during exams.

False claims

First, the claims about the girls breastfeeding at school.

The posts have appeared on social media platforms and are being shared by multiple Facebook accounts. Some of the pages have more than 150,000 followers.

Each post is being shared with the same photo - what appears to be a line of young women wearing blue uniforms, each carrying a baby.

There are no links to sources or published articles.

The use of the photo has led to confusion and outrage among social media users. One wrote: "What a shame is this? What are the reasons to this outcome? What is wrong with our moral standards?"

Others have doubted whether it is true, and they are right to be sceptical.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Government figures suggest in Kenya the teenage pregnancy rate has been falling

The photograph first appeared in an online CNN article and it is not of mothers at a school in Kenya.

CNN has confirmed to Reality Check that the photograph was taken in Tanzania of young women walking children to a day care centre.

This same photo has been attached to a range of posts, all making similar claims about pregnancy in Kenyan schools.

Some posts claimed 19 out of 30 girls in the class were breastfeeding. Others said it was 21 out of 30 girls.

We also looked into the school frequently named in the posts and found that Chabera Mixed Secondary, Nyanza does not exist.

We asked a local reporter for the BBC to go to the area to check, and although there is a secondary school in Chabera, it has a different name and there was no evidence to support the claims.

Facts about teenage pregnancy

The recent debate in Kenya about the rates of teenage pregnancy has been clouded by social media posts such as these.

But there is widespread concern about the issue.

"Teenage pregnancy is not a new phenomenon in Kenya," says Elizabeth Muiruri, of Save the Children. "However, the recent media coverage of several girls who delivered during the three days of primary exams that transitions them to high school has been alarming."

The BBC has interviewed schoolteachers and education and health officials in Kisumu county and neighbouring areas in the western region. They expressed concern at what they said was a rise in the number of teenage pregnancies, including girls under the age of 15.

They cited the causes as high levels of poverty, a lack of sex education and gender inequality.

Between July 2016 and June 2017, the Kenyan ministry of health recorded almost 350,000 pregnancies among young women aged between 15 and 19.

This counts pregnant women who go to health facilities for pre-natal and ante-natal care, so does not capture those who do not seek help at a hospital, which means the overall figure could be significantly higher.

And, according to the last Kenyan government health survey conducted in 2014, 18% of women aged between 15 and 19 were mothers or pregnant with their first child.

But to compare teenage pregnancy over time and across countries, the United Nations uses rates per 1,000.

According to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), which uses Kenyan health survey data, the rate for births among women aged 15 to 19 was 96 per 1,000 women in 2014.

But this data also clearly shows a significant falling trend in pregnancy rates, from a high of 153 per 1,000 in 1989 - a drop of one-third.

This can be attributed to sex education in schools, better awareness of contraceptives and improved prosecution of perpetrators, says Fredrick Okwayo, an adviser at the UN Population Fund.

However the absolute number of girls involved is still "huge" and "in some cases this leads to the affected girls to miss their opportunities in life".

How does Kenya compare?

Some other African countries, including Nigeria and Tanzania, have higher rates, according to data compiled by the World Bank, while South Africa has a lower rate. All have shown significant declines over the past 30 years.

Despite the lack of evidence to suggest increasing teenage pregnancy rates in Kenya, and levels comparable with other African countries, there is no doubt that the issue is of great concern to many in Kenya and has prompted government action.

The next government health survey aims to determine the extent of the problem in more detail and whether the most recent claims of a rise in pregnancies is borne out.

BREXIT: WHAT DOES THE DRAFT WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT REVEAL?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Brexit agreement summarised in two minutes

The draft withdrawal agreement is all about how the UK leaves the European Union. It's not about any permanent future relationship.

It's a long read - 585 pages long - and we've just had a first look at the text. There will be plenty more to say in the days ahead.

But what's in this draft document, that some people thought might never materialise?

Well we've known about a lot of the content for some time.

There are details of the financial settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill) that the two sides agreed some months ago: over time, it means the UK will pay at least £39bn to the EU to cover all its financial obligations.

There's also a long section on citizens' rights after Brexit for EU citizens in the UK and Brits elsewhere in Europe. It maintains their existing residency rights, but big questions remain about a host of issues, including the rights of UK citizens to work across borders elsewhere in the EU.

Transition period

The legal basis for a transition (or implementation) period, beginning after Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019. It would be 21 months during which the UK would continue to follow all European Union rules (in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term change).

That means that during transition, the UK would remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (in fact, the ECJ is mentioned more than 60 times in this document). The document says that decisions adopted by European Union institutions during this period "shall be binding on and in the United Kingdom".

The transition period is also designed to allow time for the UK and the EU to reach a trade deal. The draft agreement says both sides will use their "best endeavours" to ensure that a long term trade deal is in place by the end of 2020. Significantly, if more time is needed, the option of extending the transition appears in the document (although, it makes it clear that the UK would have to pay for it).

The document doesn't say how long the transition could be extended for (in fact they've left the date blank), only that the Joint Committee may take a decision "extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX]." UK officials hope that the date will be clarified by the time of the proposed EU summit on 25 November.

Northern Ireland

If there was no long term trade agreement and no extension of the transition, that's when the so-called "backstop" would kick in. It's the issue that has dominated negotiations for the last few weeks and months: how to ensure that no hard border (with checks or physical infrastructure) emerges after Brexit between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

Both sides agreed back in December 2017 that there should be a guarantee to avoid a hard border under all circumstances. That guarantee came to be known as the backstop, but agreeing a legal text proved very difficult.

So what exactly does this draft agreement say about the border, the backstop and the legal guarantees that underpin it?

If a backstop is needed, it will - as expected - take the form of a temporary customs union encompassing not just Northern Ireland but the whole of the UK.

The draft agreement describes this as a "single customs territory".

Northern Ireland, though, will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than Great Britain, and even more closely tied to the rules of the EU single market.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.

Fishing

One policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing.

That's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that "the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify" an agreement "on access to waters and fishing opportunities".

The way out?

There are also details of one of the last issues to be negotiated - the terms on which the UK may be able to leave this temporary customs arrangement in the future.

If either party notifies the other that it wants the backstop to come to an end, a joint ministerial committee will meet within six months to consider the details.

But the backstop (which is part of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland) would only cease to apply if "the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly" that it is no longer necessary. In other words, the UK will not have a unilateral right to bring those arrangements to an end.

For some Brexiteers, that is simply unacceptable.

But, don't forget, other countries will also have their concerns.

They too will focus on the language surrounding a temporary customs union, to ensure that nothing is hidden there which could, in their view, give the UK rights without responsibilities; and - potentially - a competitive advantage.

The EU insists the draft agreement "includes the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK."

So, it's not just in London that this document will be closely scrutinised.

Finally one big question: to what extent could these temporary customs arrangements form the basis for a permanent future relationship, which can only be negotiated formally after Brexit has actually happened?

CLIMATE CHANGE: REPORT WARNS OF GROWING IMPACT ON US LIFE

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world

Unchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life, a US government report warns.

"Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today," the 4th National Climate Assessment says.

The report says climate change is "presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth".

The warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda.

Sounding an alarm

By James Cook, Los Angeles correspondent, BBC News

During a blast of icy weather in Washington this week, Donald Trump tweeted, "whatever happened to global warming?"

Now, without mentioning the president, his own scientists have answered their boss's question in comprehensive detail.

Global warming is here in the United States, they say - now. It is already deadly serious and without urgent, dramatic change, it will be catastrophic.

Image copyright EPA Image caption The report warns that the frequency of wildfires could increase if climate change is unchecked

This report is striking for two reasons. First, it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples - overwhelmed dams in South Carolina; failing crops in the parched Great Plains; a rise in insect-borne disease in Florida.

And, secondly, it majors on the economic impact, in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation.

With warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure, falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity, the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life.

The White House said the report - compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments - was inaccurate.

Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was "largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population".

The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity.

What does the report say?

The US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society.

"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states," the report says.

"Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century."

The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events.

But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and "to adapt to the changes that will occur".

What reaction has there been?

Environmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action.

Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, said the report made it clear that climate change was not "some problem in the distant future".

"It's happening right now in every part of the country," she said.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This bar in San Francisco had a climate change message during a summit in the city in September

That view was echoed by Abigail Dillen, president of environmental group Earthjustice.

"While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, his own administration is sounding the alarm," she said.

What does President Trump say about climate change?

In October, President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a "political agenda", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures.

After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels.

At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new "fair" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.

During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was "a hoax". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: "I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference."

How great is the climate threat?

A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could only be stopped if the world made major, and costly, changes.

That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops.

If the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

THE MIDDLE EAST’S TRAVELLING STORYTELLERS

A low, throaty voice worked its way through the city of Diyarbakır, reaching further than it had any right to. Even without understanding a word of Kurdish, I had no doubt about the sorrow it expressed through its mournful tones.

Regarded as the capital of Turkish Kurdistan, Diyarbakır (Amed in Kurdish) is perched on a bluff overlooking the turbulent Tigris River in south-eastern Turkey. I visited in summer when the heat was stifling, the surrounding countryside scorched yellow. The sun fell heavy on the city’s foreboding black basalt walls, which absorbed its warmth and radiated it back out again.

That lone sorrowful voice cut through it all, telling a story of love and loss, hope and despair

The city felt empty during the midday heat, but as evening shadows fell, a group of school kids tumbled down its winding streets kicking a flattened football. Head-scarved women shuffled home, pulling shopping carts overflowing with a rainbow of fresh market produce, the range of goods befitting Diyarbakır’s location in the Fertile Crescent.

Following the sound I’d heard, I walked through the maze of Diyarbakır’s narrow, winding streets. I spied glimpses of life through archways that penetrated the black brick buildings and opened out onto courtyards. Fig and mulberry trees provided dappled shade. Cries of hawkers, barks of stray dogs and the beeps of car horns all bubbled up into the soundscape of the sun-baked city. Yet that lone sorrowful voice cut through it all, telling a story of love and loss, hope and despair.

Finally, I entered through an open archway into the Mala Dengbêjan (House of Dengbêj). Here, the smart, flagstone courtyard of a beautifully restored, century-old house was the stage, stalls and gallery of an open-air theatre.

The sadness in this voice that emanated from here is echoed in the city’s uneasy past. The area once known as Kurdistan was divided between Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran in a secret agreement between the British and French in 1916. In this stateless nation of between 25-35 million people, it is the strength of their traditions, language, culture and shared history that bind them together.

Ever since the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, Kurdish language and culture have had to fight to survive oppression and policies of assimilation as the capital Ankara tried to unify the newly formed country, while Kurds fought for their own state.

The scars of its most recent troubles – the 2016 clashes between the Turkish state and Kurdish militants – are still fresh. Much of the old part of Diyarbakır was destroyed, construction works cover its gaping wounds and large swathes of the city remain fenced off as it is being slowly rebuilt.

In the courtyard of the Mala Dengbêjan, mismatched chairs were available for visitors. In the back of the courtyard a dozen men sat in a loose circle, their once-black hair mostly whitened by age, creases diligently ironed into their short-sleeved, light-coloured shirts.

A stout man in a striped shirt and flat cap with a thick moustache was narrating his story; a half-spoken, half-sung acapella epic. He leant forward in his seat moving from left to right, looking around in a practiced manner to ensure his story was heard by all.



(Credit: BBC News Türkçe)

He raised his left hand to emphasise points, while a string of prayer beads fell from his right, his fingers turning the beads automatically. He performed for several hours, without once checking any notes.

His voice filled the space, more a sung poem than a song. The distinct phrases were punctuated by pauses, with some notes held, other words repeated. He was truly a master of his voice, varying its pitch for dramatic effect. The audience listened intently, some raising their hands in appreciation or gesticulating to emphasise the points along with him.

The term dengbêj (pronounced deng-bay) is a Kurdish term that can be translated as ‘master of the voice’ made from the words deng (voice) and bêj (from the verb, ‘to say’) and refers to both to the performers and to the art itself. The perpetuators traditionally are travelling storytellers that keep Kurdish history and legends alive.

In Kurdish towns and villages throughout history, people have gathered in houses to hear these epic stories. The majority of singers are men, although there have been some celebrated female singers, too. They may not always be literate, but they store great libraries in their heads, gathering tales as they travel and carrying them on to reach new ears.

The dengbêj tradition suffered under Turkish oppression. Expressions of Kurdish culture and language were associated with Kurdish separatism, feared by the Turkish state. Between 1983 and 1991, speaking Kurdish in public was officially banned and owning Kurdish literature or a tape of Kurdish music was a criminal offence. However, the tradition of dengbêj never died.

“I think the dengbêj art survived because the majority of Kurds used to live in rural areas,” explained Hanifi Barış, a Kurdish academic from the University of Aberdeen who has carried out research on this subject. “Gatherings at guesthouses, the house of a notable person or the house of the dengbêj was common cultural practice in the long winter nights in Kurdistan. I grew up in such a house.”

These gatherings, called şevbêrk (literally ‘passing time in the evenings’), provided the dengbêj with the security, privacy and audience they needed to perform their art.

In the early years of the 21st Century, Kurdish-Turkish relations went through a period of improvement. In 2004, Ankara allowed the limited use of Kurdish language in state broadcasts; in 2009, the state television launched a Kurdish language channel; and in 2012, school were granted permission to teach Kurdish as an elective subject.

The Mala Dengbêjan opened in 2007 as an attempt by the pro-Kurdish municipality to help both revive and recognise dengbêj as a specifically Kurdish tradition. The centre has played a significant part in bringing it back into the public eye.

Open from 09:00 to 18:00, Tuesday to Sunday, the Mala Dengbêjan has no set performance times and serves as much as a meeting place as a cultural centre. As I sat and watched the man sing, glasses of steaming tea clinked in their saucers and conversations were muttered in lowered voices. New people arrived and were greeted by a clasp of the hand and a kiss on both cheeks.

The recital songs – known as kilams – often focus on love or war, heroes or traitors, and the divisions and relationships between different Kurdish factions. They keep the story of the Kurdish people alive, strengthening Kurdish unity by recognising its struggle through its history and legends. As well as learning the songs from their masters, dengbêjs may compose their own, and are celebrated for their lyrical skills.

“Dengbêj songs can arouse emotions in me that no other music can,” Barış said. “Maybe it is because I listened to my parents singing them with great emotion. Maybe it’s because I’ve been exposed to the emotions they trigger in people since a young age. I am not sure why they do so, but they do nevertheless.”

Dengbêj songs can arouse emotions in me that no other music can

In the countryside across the region, dengbêjs still perform to small audiences in people’s homes. Now legal, it faces a new challenge in battling against the lures of the television (although a number of TV programmes give a platform to the art) and the pull to the cities. While there has been mass migration to Turkey’s urban centres, for those that remain in the villages, traditional ways of life prevail.

Baran Çetin grew up in one such village in the mountains of the east of Turkey, not far from the border with Armenia. “It’s a beautiful place, but a hard life,” he told me. Aged 35, he now lives and works in Istanbul. With some three million Kurds resident in the metropolis, the city has the world’s largest Kurdish population.

His uncle, a dengbêj, learned the art from his father, who learned from his father before him. Çetin adores the dengbêj tradition but admits that his voice is not good enough to be considered one; the best keepers of this tradition tend to be much older, having gained both experience and stories.

“When I listen to dengbêjs, I find myself right in the moment that they are singing about. It represents all aspects of life. You can feel hope, joy and melancholy all at once,” he explained, using the Turkish word hüzün for the latter emotion.

The Nobel Prize-winning Turkish author Orhan Pamuk has written about hüzün, describing it as something more than melancholy; a feeling of loss that also provides a poetic licence to feel that way. “It is the absence, not the presence, of hüzün that causes the sufferer distress,” Pamuk wrote in his book Istanbul: Memories and the City. “It is the failure to experience hüzün that leads him to feel it."

I lost track of time as I sat in the Mala Dengbêjan. Each bard that took the floor led the listeners on a different journey through the chronicles of Kurdish history. Even without comprehending a word, I was swept up in the stories. For the first time, I understood what Pamuk meant by his description of hüzün. Recent years of Kurdish history may be characterised by melancholy, but at the same time, there is hope. By continuing to recount these stories, passed down orally from one master to the next, dengbêjs will keep Kurdish culture alive.

BREXIT: MAY HEADS TO BRUSSELS ON EVE OF CRUCIAL EU SUMMIT

Image copyright EPA Image caption Theresa May is facing obstacles to her Brexit plan at home and in Europe

Theresa May is heading to Brussels later ahead of a critical EU summit to formally sign off the Brexit deal.

The prime minister will hold talks with top EU officials, before leaders of all 28 countries meet to endorse the agreement on Sunday.

However, Spain has said it will not attend unless a last-minute spat over Gibraltar is sorted out.

Even if the EU approves the deal, Mrs May must still persuade enough MPs to support it which could prove difficult.

Meanwhile the leader of the DUP - which Mrs May relies on for support in Parliament - will reiterate her opposition of the deal at her party conference later, after threatening to look again at the confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives if it gets through Parliament.

What will happen at the summit?

On Saturday, Mrs May will meet with the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and European Council President Donald Tusk for talks.

Then on Sunday, EU leaders will meet for the special Brexit summit. They will be asked to approve two key Brexit documents:

The political declaration, which sets out what the UK and EU's relationship will be like after Brexit - outlining how things like UK-EU trade and security will work

The EU withdrawal agreement: a 585-page, legally-binding document setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU. It covers the UK's £39bn "divorce bill", citizens' rights and the thorny issue of the Northern Ireland "backstop" - to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What's in the political declaration?

BBC News correspondent Kevin Connolly said some member states are "suspicious of the possibility the UK might be attempting some last-minute negotiations" on Saturday.

There is no formal vote on Sunday but the EU expects to proceed after reaching a consensus.

Why is Spain unhappy?

Spain has raised last-minute objections to how the issue of Gibraltar - a British Overseas Territory with 30,000 residents, 96% whom voted to remain in the EU - has been handled in the Brexit talks so far.

It wants the UK to publish a written statement promising that Spain will be directly consulted on questions relating to Gibraltar during its future trade negotiations with the EU.

On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he will not decide whether to attend Sunday's summit until the assurances are provided.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Sanchez is pro-European and it is not in his nature to scupper EU plans, the BBC's Katya Adler said

Although one country on its own cannot block the withdrawal agreement being approved, there is "no way the EU can rubber stamp a text when an existing member is so strongly opposed", said BBC News' Europe editor Katya Adler.

Gibraltar is believed to be the only outstanding issue ahead of the summit.

France, Denmark and the Netherlands had raised concerns over what the political declaration said about fishing rights in UK waters - but this issue is understood to have been resolved.

What happens after the summit?

If the EU signs off the withdrawal deal, Mrs May will then need to persuade MPs in her own Parliament to back it.

A vote in Parliament is expected to happen in December.

Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the DUP have all said they will vote against the government's deal.

Some of Mrs May's own Conservative MPs - the hardline Brexiteers - are also highly critical of the deal and are unlikely to support it, while other Remainer Tory MPs may also vote against it.

If MPs back the deal, it then has to be ratified by the European Parliament.

Once the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 - which will happen with or without a deal - the details of a long-term trade deal will be worked out during a 21-month transition period until December 2020.

But if the deal is defeated, a number of things could happen - including leaving in March without a deal, a second attempt to get the Brexit deal passed, another referendum or a general election.

What does Theresa May say about the deal?

On Friday, the PM said the UK should not hope for a "better deal" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement.

But she declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be "different".

Meanwhile, the Telegraph said it has seen leaked Cabinet papers which suggest the PM is planning to "reframe the Brexit debate around migration" - by planning restrictions on low-skilled migrants coming to the UK - in a bid to attract the support of hard Brexiteers ahead of the House of Commons vote.

Does the DUP's support matter?

Yes. After the 2017 general election, Mrs May's Conservative Party got 318 seats - four short of the number she needed to rule with a majority government.

The DUP formed a confidence and supply agreement with the Tories, promising that its 10 MPs would vote with the government, and therefore enable it to win key votes in Parliament.

The DUP opposes the Brexit deal because of the "backstop" - the last resort back-up plan to make sure a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland never happens.

It will only come into effect if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal. But the backstop would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.

TRUMP ASKS US COURT FOR REVIEW OF TRANSGENDER MILITARY BAN

Image copyright Reuters Image caption People protest President Trump's announcement of plans to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving

President Trump's administration is asking the US Supreme Court to consider its proposed restrictions on transgender military members.

It is requesting that the top court review lower court rulings blocking a military ban on transgender people.

Federal courts have prevented the military from implementing a policy barring some transgender Americans from service.

The administration wants the court to hear the dispute this term.

The president announced on Twitter in 2017 that the country would no longer "accept or allow" transgender Americans to serve in the military, citing "tremendous medical costs and disruption".

The administration has since limited the policy to transgender individuals with a history of gender dysphoria.

Following legal challenges, judges in federal courts in three jurisdictions - Washington state, California, and Washington, DC - have refused to lift injunctions issued against the president's original ban to allow the updated policy to be enforced.

The US government is appealing those decisions.

On Friday, the Trump administration filed petitions to the Supreme Court asking for its "immediate review" of the constitutional challenges to the ban.

"And absent this Court's prompt intervention, it is unlikely that the military will be able to implement its new policy any time soon," it said.

The petitions ask for the top court to consolidate the cases for decision and consider the dispute during its current term, which ends in June or July 2019.

Between 4,000 and 10,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are believed to be transgender. An Obama administration policy change has allowed them to serve in the US military.

The revised policy under the Trump administration says that transgender individuals with a history of gender dysphoria are barred from military service "except under certain limited circumstances".

The new policy approved by President Trump allows current transgender service members with gender dysphoria to continue serving if they were diagnosed after the Obama administration's policy took effect.

People with gender dysphoria experience distress or discomfort as a result of a disparity between a their biological sex (assigned at birth) and what they feel their gender to be.

According to the American Psychiatric Association, not all transgender individuals suffer from gender dysphoria.

SANDRA PARKS: ANTI-GUN STUDENT, 13, KILLED BY STRAY BULLET

Image copyright WDJT Image caption Sandra Parks, 13, was shot dead in her home in Milwaukee

"We are in a state of chaos. In the city in which I live, I hear and see examples of chaos almost every day. Little children are victims of senseless gun violence..."

Two years ago, 11-year-old Milwaukee schoolgirl Sandra Parks wrote these words in an award-winning essay about the murders in her city.

On Monday night, aged 13, she was shot by a stray bullet fired into her home.

Her frantic family called 911, but Sandra died at the scene.

The girl's mother, Bernice Parks, told police she had gone to bed early while her children watched TV. She woke to the sound of gunshots shortly before 20:00, and found her daughter bleeding on the floor.

"She said, 'Momma, I'm shot. Call the police,'" Ms Parks told TV station WITI. "I looked at her. She didn't cry. She wasn't hollering. She was just so peaceful... She didn't deserve to leave this world like that."

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett described the situation as "insanity", telling reporters: "Tragically, her death was caused by someone who just decided they were going to shoot bullets into her house, and she's dead. A 13-year-old, on Thanksgiving week, on a school night, in her bedroom, and she died."

Mr Barrett speculated that the shooter may have wanted to "settle a score, express anger, try to scare someone", saying on Tuesday: "All we know is that a 13-year-old died last night in her bedroom."

Midwestern paper the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that one suspect, Isaac D. Barnes, has been charged with homicide and a second man, Untrell Oden, faces two counts for allegedly helping to safeguard two guns.

Mr Barnes' ex-girlfriend reportedly flagged his possible involvement to a police officer at the scene. She said he had approached her parked car on a nearby street carrying an assault-style rifle and wearing a mask.

She said he swore at her and told her "you lucky the kids are in the car. I was gonna fan you down."

Police found Mr Barnes in a nearby home, hiding in a closet.

Milwaukee's murder rate has been falling since a spike between 2014 and 2015, but the city still ranks among America's most deadly, FBI figures show.

'She was everything this world is not'

Sandra was a student at Keefe Avenue School, and her essay - which she called "Our Truth" - had won third place in the Milwaukee Public Schools' yearly Martin Luther King Jr. essay contest.

She spoke to Wisconsin Public Radio in January 2017, saying she yearned to "stop all the violence and... negativity that's going on".

"All you hear about is somebody dying and somebody getting shot. People do not just think about whose father or son or granddaughter or grandson was just killed," she said.

Ms Parks told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel her daughter was "everything this world is not".

"My baby was not violent. My baby did not like violence," she said. "Everybody she knew, everybody that came past, she made them happy."

Milwaukee Public Schools said Sandra is the seventh child at a district school to be murdered in 2018.

At a vigil outside her home on Tuesday night, her grieving mother acknowledged that grim toll.

"I understand that there was a lot of kids that passed away recently and I wouldn't say that my baby was better than the rest," she said.

"But God, Jesus, Lord have mercy...

"Lord have mercy knows, she was a star that was trying to get out, but she didn't know how."

Thanksgiving Day violence

In Alabama on Thursday, one person was killed and two injured following a shooting at mall on the evening prior to Black Friday shopping. Police said a fight between two people, believed to be adults, led to an exchange of gunfire.

In Indiana, three people were killed and two injured in a Thursday night shooting at a private home. Police responded to a call at the home around 10:25pm local time. Two men and one woman were killed and two men were injured and are in critical condition.

In Florida, police shot and wounded an unarmed teenage boy while responding to a domestic disturbance call. Authorities say the 15-year-old was shot in the lower torso during a struggle with four police officers. The boy is reported to be in a stable condition.

GREEN BUILDINGS AROUND THE GLOBE

Cutting-edge, sustainable architecture around the world is the subject of new book Green Architecture by Philip Jodidio. Experimental perhaps, but many green buildings today tap into age-old traditions of harnessing heat through orientating them towards the sun, or by gaining thermal mass through use of thick stone or mud. The book also celebrates technological ways of controlling global warming caused by construction, which accounts for a high proportion of greenhouse gas emissions. Here is a selection of its projects, from the monumental to the modest.

Panyaden School, Thailand

Chiefly influenced by nature, Dutch practice 24 Architecture created a layout inspired by the tropical staghorn fern for this primary school in Chiang Mai. The building broadcasts its ecological aims through its extravagantly organic form, use of locally sourced materials and low carbon footprint. Its low-hanging, undulating, Gaudíesque roof – supported by columns made of fast-growing, ultra-sustainable bamboo – seems to hover above the floor, which is made of rammed earth.

Ospedale dell’Angelo, Italy

The 680-bed Ospedale dell’Angelo in Venice-Mestre, a 40-year-long project completed by Italian architect Emilio Ambasz, is billed as the ‘world’s first green general hospital’. Defying the stereotype of institutional architecture, the 30m (100ft)-high, 200m (650ft)-long entrance hall incorporates a gargantuan winter garden, overlooked by half of the patients’ rooms and by lounges on each floor. Outside the windows of the remaining patients’ rooms are plant-filled containers. And the operating rooms, laboratories, service facilities and parking areas all have green roofs.

Sony City, Japan

Sony City in Osaki, Tokyo, is Sony’s research and development department and was designed by architects Nikken Sekkei, who say it was conceived as a massive cooling device that performs like ‘a natural forest’. Solar panels projecting from the south façade that generate heat double as devices shading Sony City from strong sunlight. The building is clad with Bioskin, an external layer of ceramic tubes that cools the exterior when rainwater collected from the roof is fed into the tubes. As the water evaporates, it cools the tubes and adjacent air.

Glass/Wood House, United States

Kengo Kuma, the Japanese architect known for sympathetically connecting buildings with nature, was entrusted with renovating a glass-fronted house designed by Philip Johnson in 1956. The Glass Wood House is in New Canaan, Connecticut, and Kuma disrupted the symmetry of Johnson’s modernist box by adding an L-shaped extension that projects into the forest without imposing on the landscape. “We created a major change by getting rid of the house’s symmetry and covering its exterior with wooden louvres,” he says, adding that the renovated house now has a “mild” transparency that has superseded its 1950s “isolated” translucency.

Japanese pavilion, Italy

For the 2008 Venice Architecture Biennale, architect Junya Ishigami designed the Japanese pavilion comprising small glass houses around the building in the park, Giardini della Biennale. Ishigami referenced Joseph Paxton’s Crystal Palace at the Great Exhibition in London of 1851. Tables and benches for public use were dotted around the garden in an ambiguous blurring of indoor and outdoor space. The glass houses’ ethereal quality was emphasised by delicate drawings hung on white walls.

Chen House, Taiwan

Indoors and outdoors are connected in this farmers’ shelter with an extensive wooden deck in the Datun Mountains, Taipei. Designed by Finnish architect Marco Casagrande, it has a slatted front, that allows cool breezes to enter in warmer months. The porous facade brings daylight into the interior, while a simple fireplace keeps it warm. It is raised off the ground to protect it from occasional flooding. “The house is not strong or heavy – it is weak and flexible,” says Casagrande. “It does not close the environment out but gives farmers a needed shelter.”

Ecoboulevard of Vallecas, Spain

This monumental, 22,500-sq-m (240,000 sq ft) proposal for an urban pavilion in Madrid was dreamt up by Spanish architects Ecosistema Urbano, who refer to it as an “air tree”. Designed to stand in the centre of a busy avenue, surrounded by trees and filled with tiers of vegetation, it provides an oasis of coolness during the city’s oppressively dry summer months. Its temperature is lowered inside by tiers of vegetation and water vapour generated by solar panels that makes the space eight to 10 degrees cooler than the street outside.

U6 Penthouse, Germany

Created by German architects Heberle Mayer, this idiosyncratic, low-cost addition to an existing building in Berlin – on previously unused roof space – is made using a greenhouse manufactured by French firm Filclair. Planning restrictions vetoed covering the entire roof, resulting in an outdoor terrace used in summer, where a mobile kitchen can be placed. In winter, the transparent structure is passively heated by sunlight, although an inner layer of curtains made from a heat-reflecting fabric and large sliding doors prevent the interior overheating.

Green School, Indonesia

An arresting, primeval-looking structure in the thick of the jungle in Badung, Bali, announces the presence of this experimental school, which educates its pupils about sustainable materials. The building’s open sides connect it with the outdoors and an open-plan interior encourage natural ventilation. The project was conceived by design-and-construction company PT Bamboo Pure, which uses bamboo, and the Meranggi Foundation, which establishes bamboo plantations in Indonesia, distributing the plants to local farmers for free. Other parts of the school were constructed using recycled rubber and car windshields, while its grounds boast an organic garden and fences made of living trees.

'I PARTIED ALL NIGHT TO HIDE FROM MY PTSD'

A study suggests that one in six veterans who left the British military after serving in a combat role in Iraq or Afghanistan would probably qualify for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In some, the symptoms only appear years later.

On Remembrance Day in 2015, Phillip Riding, had been out of the military for one month. He went to the Cenotaph as a civilian, with his medals from Afghanistan pinned to a white shirt, and sang God Save the Queen with the crowd.

In the silence afterwards, a bugle sounded The Last Post. And in that moment, suddenly the memories of Afghanistan came flooding back.

"Something inside had snapped. I couldn't breathe, I was panicking standing there in the ceremony with tears rolling down my face," Riding says. "That sound of the bugle reminded me of the moment it was announced every time a comrade was lost."

Friends, killed or injured, flashed in front of his eyes: Bing from artillery, Tres shot in the ankle, Rocco, Plant, Coops, LJ shot in the shoulder, Jordan….

For five years he had been suppressing these thoughts.

"I thought I was fine but all of a sudden I wasn't any more. That door I kept shut, opened completely. This is how PTSD is, it's something that creeps up on you. It just totally destroyed me."

Riding joined the Army in August 2007 at the age of 16, partly to get out of his home town, Barrow-in-Furness, in Cumbria. He'd faced homophobic bullying at school and thought a "macho" role in the infantry would help mask the fact that he was gay.

"I was living with these guys seven days a week, and I started copying how straight men moved. My body language was super-exaggerated to be manly because I was trying to fit to this image of who I wanted to be in my head."

Image copyright Phil Riding

He would plaster his bedside with soft porn. "Bikini models were for sure not what I wanted to see first thing in the morning but there we are."

He even put a pretend girlfriend in his will before leaving for his tour of Afghanistan.

In 2010 the British military had the task of curbing opium production in Helmand Province. It was a dangerous job in territory largely controlled by the Taliban.

"Once you've been shot at it never leaves your brain. The bullet that comes near you sounds like a crack of a whip. There were countless operations where I was in a near-death situation, almost blown up in armoured vehicles by improvised devices or ducking shells from our Apache [helicopter]."

Riding wasn't hurt himself, but many were.

"There was a task to go out and do some metal-detecting. We played a game of rock paper scissors to decide who should go on patrol and who should stay behind. I won the game. He went out and was shot in the ankle."

Image copyright Phil Riding

One of his roles in Afghanistan was to drive lorries. Once he went on rest and recreation, and the driver who took his place rolled over an IED and ended up having his back reconstructed.

He was lucky, but being lucky made him feel guilty. "Shouldn't it have been me? Shouldn't I have gone on patrol?" he asks.

Coming close to death made Riding think hard about his life, and he decided to come out and live authentically as a gay man. "It was like being born again," he says. "This time I was being who I wanted to be - myself."

Initially his family didn't take the news well. Around Christmas 2011, when Same-Sex Marriage Bill was passing through Parliament, Riding's younger brother asked if he would get married. His grandmother then said she wouldn't attend the wedding if so, and his mother followed suit. "There was an argument, and I wish that I had handled it better," he says. He left home on Boxing Day.

Coming out to people in the army didn't go well either. Some former friends got up and left when he sat down next to them at dinner. Things only improved after he launched a complaint. Now he decorated his bedside exuberantly with rainbow flags and male pin-ups.

Image copyright Phillip Riding Image caption Marching at Pride in 2015

He also found solace in London's LGBT community, travelling up there at the weekends. The gay nightclub scene in Soho was so different from army life, it was a form of escape.

"It was blessing to talk to people who didn't know anything about the military or what it was like in Afghanistan.

"My friends were incredulous, teasing me: 'Seven months in Afghanistan? Just you and all those soldiers, and nothing happened? Yeah right!'"

Being in the army isn't like it's depicted in the movies. "Not everyone is really handsome, dashing. You're enjoying not thinking about romance. From the moment you wake up, you're working and your mind is on the job."

But the high-octane pace of clubbing also seemed to serve one of his needs after the tour in Afghanistan.

"When you have adrenaline pumped into you every single day for seven months, when you come home that's missing. Time moves slow. People moved slowly. It was so quiet. I needed to be in the clubs to fill that gap.

"Being in a nightclub, it's just so loud, the bass in the floor. There is so much energy everywhere - it's sensory overload."

Image copyright Joel Ryder

Riding had his driving licence revoked after being caught speeding twice in two years after he returned from Helmand. "Once I was going 85 mph on a 60 mph dual carriageway with music at full blast. Risky stuff like that because it was an adrenaline rush."

He thinks that the excitement of coming out probably helped to mask his PTSD after Afghanistan. "I didn't think I had an issue. I was dealing with accepting my sexuality and meeting all these new people. For the first time in my life, there were people who I fancied who actually fancied me back!"

When it came to renew his contract with the army in October 2015, he decided against it and took up a job as an events manager for a nightclub. He would go into Soho in the day, arrange the events and be ready to work late into the night, while socialising with friends.

But he found himself asking this question: "I've come out, but why am I still hitting the bottle? Why am I still not wanting to go to sleep?"

And a month later, on Remembrance Day, he received an answer.

Riding likens the feeling of suppressing his PTSD to trying to hold down an inflatable ball in water. "It's different for everybody, but this is what it's like for me. I kept trying to hold down all the things I saw and you can only hold it down for so long. The more you hold it down, the stronger the ball shoots back up, more powerful than before. And that's what happened with me."

He started having nightmares about his time on tour and working all night seemed to help him cope.

"I would have flashbacks. I did what I could to avoid closing my eyes in case I started to see Afghanistan," he says. "I wanted to physically exhaust myself, so that when I eventually got home in the early hours, I could just collapse in bed and I wouldn't dream."

The Last Post had been the first sound to trigger Riding's PTSD, but other everyday sounds now had the same effect - a motorcycle abruptly appearing from nowhere or someone yelling in the street.

What does PTSD feel like?

Flashbacks & nightmares: These can be so realistic that it feels as though you are living through the traumatic experience again and again - ordinary sounds, sights and smells can trigger flashbacks

Avoidance & numbing: You distract yourself by keeping your mind busy with an activity or working very hard, while avoiding places and people that remind you of the trauma - and you may try to become emotionally numb, feeling nothing at all

Being hypervigilant: You stay alert all the time, as though you are looking out for danger - anxiety makes it hard to sleep, and others may notice that you are irritable and cannot relax

Source: The Royal College of Psychiatrists

There was a trigger in the club as well.

"At midnight they have this balloon drop, balloons fall from the ceiling and they bounce on the crowd. The sound it makes is just like gunfire happening over my head."

The first time he experienced it he was frozen on the spot. "It shocked me that even though my brain was telling me I am literally just seeing balloons fall down, I couldn't move because I was panicking."

It got to the point that Riding would leave quickly when the balloon drop was about to happen and his friends noticed. "No-one understood why, because I didn't tell anyone. They just thought I was weirdo, that 'Phil doesn't like balloons.'"

Image copyright Phillip Riding Image caption Phillip Riding and Chrissy Darling at Popcorn, Heaven

He felt that working in the club brought some order to his life. "I was in the military for years, having that authority, I got used to it. In a way, being that person that people look to in the nightclub for direction is similar."

But the sense of the club as a safe space was shattered on 12 June 2016, when a gunman opened fire at a gay nightclub - Pulse, in Orlando, Florida - killing 49 people and injuring 53 before being shot dead by police. At the time, it was the deadliest massacre in modern American history.

Statistics on military PTSD

17% of ex-forces whose last deployment was a combat role in Iraq or Afghanistan would probably qualify for a PTSD diagnosis, according to a study published last month by the King's Centre for Military Health Research

PTSD prevalence rates for the military population as a whole have increased from about 4% in 2003-4 to about 6% in 2014-15 - the rate could be as high as 9% in some combat units, researchers from the King's Centre told the Commons Defence Select Committee in March

They added that 50% of the PTSD that arises in the forces is caused by non-operational traumatic incidents such as car accidents or assaults

Riding had actually been to Pulse in 2011. "I know the venue and I knew some of the people who were there that night. I think about them pinned down in the bathroom... and having to witness their friends and family being shot and killed," he says.

"It was horrifying, warfare coming into the community I know and love. Before I felt that I could keep the worlds apart but now they are crashing into each other. The idea that a terrorist attack could happen here too."

It wouldn't be the first time, Riding says, mentioning the 1999 nail-bomb attack carried out by a neo-Nazi at the Admiral Duncan, one of Soho's oldest gay pubs.

He started to be troubled by intrusive thoughts, imagining bad things happening to his family and friends. In Afghanistan he had been bothered by the thought that if he had acted differently, a comrade might not have got hurt. Now this kind of thinking became obsessive and infiltrated his daily life.

When meeting a friend for coffee in Soho, he would imagine a bomb exploding in the gay bar next door and his friend dying in front of him. "The questions cross my mind, 'What if they were just late by 10 minutes? What if I had just gone shopping, and they wouldn't have had to come meet me?'

"It never ends. This guilt is unbearable. Not just the guilt of what has happened but even hypothetical situations. So what can I do?"

It took years for Riding to be formally diagnosed with PTSD and start receiving therapy.

For a long time he tried to avoid seeking help, mistakenly believing that a diagnosis of PTSD on his medical record would harm his prospects when applying for jobs. Other soldiers were under the same illusion, he says.

"It's one of those urban legends. We simply didn't talk about mental health to each other so I didn't know. I wish I had known sooner."

Help for those affected

Nowadays he makes a conscious effort to rethink the noises that trigger his PTSD. At 27, he's made a conscious effort to associate the national anthem with good times. "It always has me in tears," he says. "I want to think instead about all the good times with all the brave lads."

He says that his sleeping is better now and that he's in control of his PTSD - not the other way round. Trying to bury it, he says, was the wrong idea.

"So if my PTSD is that inflatable ball - it's like it's been deflated. It'll still be here but I'm holding it down for now."

VIRGIN ATLANTIC IN TALKS TO RESCUE FLYBE

Image copyright Getty Images

Flybe and Virgin Atlantic have confirmed they are in talks about a sale or closer alliance.

The move comes after cash-strapped Flybe put itself up for sale earlier this month.

The Exeter-based regional airline said that Virgin was "one of the parties" it has been in discussions with.

Last month, Flybe warned its full-year losses would be £22m, blaming falling consumer demand, a weaker pound and higher fuel costs.

Confirming the talks, Flybe added that there was no certainty that an offer would be made by Virgin.

In a short statement, Virgin Atlantic said it "has a trading and codeshare relationship with Flybe and confirms that it is reviewing its options in respect of Flybe which range from enhanced commercial arrangements to a possible offer for Flybe".

Since hitting a price of nearly 50p in March this year, Flybe's shares have fallen by more than three-quarters. On Friday, they jumped by nearly half to 14.3p.

Heathrow access

Aviation analyst Andrew Charlton, from Aviation Advocacy, said Virgin Atlantic was likely lured to the beleaguered budget carrier to gain access to its take-off and landing slots at Heathrow airport.

"Flybe has a fine suite of slots across the UK, particularly at Heathrow. Any bid by Virgin would be a back-door way to get access to them and is probably cheaper than to wait to buy similar landing slots outright."

Mr Charlton said that Virgin Atlantic may also benefit from certain regional routes flown by Flybe which would deliver passengers into London for Virgin Atlantic's long-haul operations based in London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports.

Flybe, whose roots date back to 1979, has 78 planes operating from smaller airports such as London City, Southampton, Cardiff, Belfast City, Aberdeen and Norwich to destinations in the UK and Europe.

It serves about eight million passengers a year, but has been struggling to recover from an expensive IT overhaul and has been trying to reduce costs.

SAMSUNG APOLOGISES TO SICK FACTORY WORKERS

Samsung has formally apologised to employees who fell sick or died after working in its factories.

In the apology, Samsung president Kim Ki-nam said staff and families had "suffered" because the South Korean company had been too slow to act.

Earlier this month Samsung agreed a compensation deal for workers who fell ill while on its production lines.

The apology follows a campaign to win redress for staff by Hwang Sang-ki, the father of one Samsung worker who died.

Cash payout

"Beloved colleagues and families have suffered for a long time, but Samsung Electronics failed to take care of the matter earlier," said Mr Kim, adding that the company had "lacked being considerate".

He said Samsung Electronics had not "fully and completely" handled potential health risks on production lines that make chips and LCD displays.

"Today, we wish to express a sincere apology to the workers who suffered from diseases, as well as their families," Mr Kim said.

Mr Hwang Sang-ki, who headed the compensation campaign, said the apology did not go far enough.

"Honestly, today's apology made by a Samsung Electronics CEO is not sufficient for the victims of the work-related diseases," he told the Yonhap news agency.

However, he said, he would "consider" it as resolution of the issue.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The death of Hwang Yumi prompted her father to lead a compensation campaign

Mr Hwang began the compensation campaign in 2007 after his daughter, Hwang Yumi. died on the way to hospital after developing leukaemia.

He sought to shame the company into making payouts to workers who suffered the same disease or who contracted other illnesses after working for the company.

He set up the Supporters for the Health and Rights of People in the Semiconductor Industry (Sharps) with the help of labour activists. The group held protests and sit-ins to put pressure on Samsung to act.

Sharps said it had found 319 other victims, 117 of whom had died, as of June this year.

The compensation package agreed this month will see sick workers - and their children with related illnesses - get up to 150m won (£103,207) per illness.

All current or former staff who worked for Samsung and its sub-contractors on the chip and display lines in the Giheung factory in South Korea since 1984 can apply for compensation.

The agreement does not acknowledge that Samsung workplaces are directly related to the diseases suffered by some employees.

D&G: CHINA SHOPPING SITES PULL PRODUCTS IN AD BACKLASH

Image copyright Getty Images

Dolce & Gabbana products have been pulled from Chinese e-commerce sites as the backlash against a controversial ad campaign grows.

The firm posted videos this week showing a Chinese model struggling to eat pasta and pizza with chopsticks.

The campaign was accused of trivialising Chinese culture and promoting unflattering stereotypes.

The controversy risks alienating Dolce & Gabbana from one of the world's biggest luxury markets.

Local celebrities have called for a boycott of the brand.

The brand crisis deepened when messages allegedly written by co-founder Stefano Gabbana, which included offensive comments about Chinese people, went viral.

The firm apologised for any offence but said it and Gabbana's Instagram accounts had been hacked.

It offered a fresh apology on Friday, publishing a video showing Gabbana and co-founder Domenico Dolce appealing for their "misunderstanding of Chinese culture" to be forgiven.

Image copyright Dolce and Gabbana Image caption Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana asked for "forgiveness"

A brand that 'knows China'

The Italian firm cancelled its fashion show in Shanghai earlier this week.

But the backlash has continued as retailers in China retreated from the brand.

On Friday, Dolce & Gabbana products were not available in China on major e-commerce sites Taobao and JD.com, as well as smaller platforms Kaola and Secoo.

Alina Ma, associate director of research at market insights firm Mintel, said the advert had left Chinese consumers confused and appeared to show the company did not understand them.

"They want a brand that knows them, that makes them feel that they are important," Ms Ma said.

It is a crucial market for luxury firms. A 2018 report by consultancy Bain & Company forecast the luxury goods market in mainland China will grow by up to 22% this year.

"Chinese consumers continue to stand out as a growth-driver for the industry," the report said.

While the controversy could hurt their business, the long-term impact will depend on how Dolce & Gabbana deal with the fallout.

"If they can show they sincerely want to know the Chinese consumer, want to know the Chinese market… their business may turn around," Ms Ma said.

Other controversies

It is not the first time Dolce & Gabbana has drawn controversy.

Last April, the brand posted a campaign on Weibo that showed impoverished people in run-down areas of Beijing pictured with Dolce & Gabbana models ahead of a catwalk show in the city.

The pictures were criticised for stereotyping Chinese history by showing old parts of the city, rather than more modern depictions of Beijing.

Dolce & Gabbana also caused controversy in 2016 when it called an item of footwear in its spring/summer collection a "slave sandal".

WHY TECH IS TAKING A HAMMERING

Image caption The FAANGs have been savaged over the past week

Technology stocks have had a very bad week. For the FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) which have led the charge in growth over the past decade, it was grim.

At their lowest point, all five were down more than 20 per cent from their peaks. This translates to hundreds of billions of dollars in value being wiped from them.

Apple was the first company to cross the $1trn mark this year. It fell to $840bn by close of play on Tuesday, and hasn't recovered since.

Amazon, which also briefly crossed over the $1trn threshold, dropped to $731bn. That's a quarter of a trillion dollars right there. I know your sympathy for Jeff Bezos may be limited, but these are big numbers. Facebook, meanwhile, is trading at around the value it had early last year - long before the scandals of this year took their toll.

But those scandals may be a distraction from the big pictures. Why are tech stocks taking a hammering, and what does it indicate about the wider macroeconomic picture?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Facebook scandals in 2018 have meant a tough year for Mark Zuckerberg

When considering market fluctuations and, by extension, whether to invest, the key is to look at the fundamentals and over the long-term. Some context here is vital.

Global worries

These companies are still exceptionally rich, staffed by many of the smartest innovators on earth, and good at planning. Moreover, they are registering whopping profits; indeed, record-breaking profits in Amazon's case, and forecast-beating profits for Apple and Facebook.

And given the wider hit to stock markets from weaker global GDP growth, and with a looming potential trade war between America and China, it's inevitable that tech stocks should also be hit.

But a new world is emerging for these companies, in which three fundamental shifts point to a new era that will place limitations on their acceleration. That is not to say they will go into reverse; just that they might slow.

First, monetary policy is tightening around the world. Since the financial crash, we have lived in an extraordinary period of sustained low-interest rates. This has been good for borrowers.

When borrowing is cheap, investors are - relatively speaking - more relaxed about returns. When the cost of borrowing rises, so do investor demands for reliable returns. The shift from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening puts a discipline into the market. Rising interest rates make equities sweat. Tech stocks are feeling the effect.

The second big change, which is well documented, is the threat of national and supranational regulation. A feeling unites legislators from Washington to Brussels, Berlin and Delhi: smarter regulation of these companies is socially necessary and, probably, economically manageable.

Resurgent nationalism in many parts of the world has curtailed the freedom of many global companies, which tech giants almost by definition are. And the example of GDPR in Europe, which aims to shift control of data back to consumers from these companies, is being closely watched. If it is seen to work, it will be widely copied.

Peaking out

The third big change is perhaps less documented, and most alarming for these companies. This is the possibility that they are maxing out on scale.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman has been focusing on the idea that the remorseless pursuit of scale is what gives data-based companies their advantage

Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, has co-authored an important new book called Blitzscaling. This riffs on the idea that it is the remorseless pursuit of scale that gives data-based companies their advantage. The first scaler, rather than the first mover, will emerge victorious in various markets. That, according to Hoffman, is why venture capitalists are happy to tolerate the lack of profits at a company like Uber.

If this argument is right, what if companies like Facebook and Apple have already squeezed most of their advantage from blitzscaling their particular markets?

Apple's growth has long been powered by the iPhone - but its popularity with each new version is slowing, as rivals launch brilliant counter-attacks, and markets become saturated.

In the key markets of US, Canada and Europe, Facebook hasn't grown at all in the past quarter. Think about what that does to the mentality of a company used to super-star growth, on its way to 2.6bn global users.

What if, say, 3bn users is where Facebook will peak? That is why, by the way, the company is trying to make Instagram, which it owns and which is still growing fast, sweat, by putting more ads in that arena.

What if a back-lash against the misuse of data means consumers spend more time in the private arena of WhatsApp, where there are fewer ads, and it's much harder for Facebook (which also owns WhatsApp) to sell me a car in WhatsApp than on the Facebook News Feed?

Never had it so good

Of course it is true that the relentless drip, drip, drip of scandals engulfing some of these companies, especially Facebook, will weigh on investors too.

But go back to the bigger picture. For well over a decade, during which workers of the world dealt with a financial crash and just avoided a depression, these technology companies enjoyed astonishing freedom.

They were able - largely through their own ingenuity - to pursue growth remorselessly in a low-interest rate world, where they endured relatively little regulation. New markets and vistas constantly opened up to them, and their tax affairs were tolerated in a world of globalist sentiment.

Now interest rates are going up, regulation is coming, those markets are nearing saturation, rivals are launching better attacks, nationalism is tempering globalism, and tax affairs are under new scrutiny.

Their valuations may yet rise further, and will almost certainly bounce back from this week. But for the tech sector, a new era brings harder times.

GCHQ WARNS ON BLACK FRIDAY CYBER-THREAT

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Black Friday could provide "prime pickings" for cyber-crime, warns the security agency

Black Friday sales could be targeted as "prime pickings" for cyber-crime, the UK's cyber-security defence agency has warned shoppers.

The National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ intelligence service, is issuing advice to shoppers of the risk of "malicious" online threats.

It is the first such official cyber-warning in the run-up to the Christmas shopping season.

"It's vital that knowledge is shared," says Ian Levy of the cyber-agency.

The cyber-wing of the GCHQ communications centre says it wants to start a "national cyber-chat" on Black Friday when billions are spent on online shopping.

Speaking in public

It might be known for working in secret, but the agency wants to engage with the public over the seriousness of the threat.

It has been involved in trying to tackle more than 550 significant cyber-incidents in the past 12 months, and has taken down almost 140,000 "phishing" websites used by fraudsters.

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is giving tips for individual consumers to avoid cyber-crime - and for the first time it will be publishing answers to questions from the public on Twitter.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are warnings for better cyber-security when billions are being spent on online shopping

"Staying safe online doesn't require deep technical knowledge, and we want the whole country to know that the NCSC speaks the same language as them," said Mr Levy, the cyber-defence agency's technical director.

"With so many of the UK shopping online, we want to see these tips shared from classrooms and scout groups to family dinner tables and old people's homes."

The agency's chief executive, Ciaran Martin, recently told a meeting of business leaders of a "serious and sustained" threat, including from "elite hackers" in other countries.

"It is not speculation and it is not scare-mongering," said Mr Martin. "Large-scale criminal cyber-activity is, sadly, ubiquitous."

This could include the "theft of millions" from retailers and attacks on financial networks on which shops depend, he said.

'Post-Christmas headache'

A data breach had an average cost of £3m, he said - and there were estimates that the WannaCry cyber-attack last year had cost the United States £3.5bn.

Another cyber-attack last year, known as NotPetya, had cost one firm up to £250m, including the cost of replacement IT equipment.

The British Retail Consortium is backing the calls for better cyber-security during the Christmas shopping season.

"With more and more shoppers looking to get the best deals online, retailers continue to invest significantly in developing the right tools and expertise to protect against cyber-threats," says James Martin, security adviser to the retailers' organisation.

But he warned of the danger of cyber-crime causing a "post-Christmas headache".

The National Cyber Security Centre's advice to reduce the risk of cyber-crime is:

WHY DO BILLIONS OF PEOPLE STILL LACK BASIC SANITATION?

Image copyright WSUP Image caption Dhaka, Bangladesh: Community leader Nasima shows off her village's new community toilet

Hi-tech loos that use little or no water and can recycle waste products safely and sustainably promise to give billions of people around the world access to much-needed sanitation. So why do so many still lack this basic amenity?

About 2.3 billion people still lack basic toilets, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). And 4.5 billion don't have safely managed sanitation, with waste disposed in a way that won't contaminate drinking water.

Each year contaminated water kills half a million children under five through diarrhoeal diseases, the WHO says.

So many inventors, entrepreneurs and research institutions around the world have been working on hi-tech loos that can function without the need for expensive mains sewerage systems.

Image copyright WSUP Image caption Millions of people live next to unsanitary open sewers with potentially fatal consequences

One approach is taking chloride from urine, turning it into chlorine with electricity, and using that as a disinfectant, says Dr Brian Hawkins, a research scientist in nanomaterials at Duke University, North Carolina.

Activated charcoal can remove organic material and nano-membranes replace the need for septic tanks, he says.

A solar-powered toilet using this approach, developed at Duke and nearby universities, is being tested at a cotton mill in Coimbatore, India and a township in South Africa.

Currently, it can handle about 15 users a day.

New membrane technology means toilets can "get clean water out of human waste, which is pretty cool", says Dr Alison Parker, a lecturer at Cranfield University in Bedford.

But power is needed to push waste through the membranes. So the challenge is making a self-contained loo that doesn't need external electricity.

Image copyright Cranfield University Image caption Cranfield University's clever loo can produce clean water from human waste

Her lab's Nano Membrane Toilet works by "relying on the energy we can get from human waste, burning faeces, and the person lifting the lid and closing it again - so that's not a huge amount of energy to work with," she says.

But reverse electrodialysis, from putting faeces components on one side of the membrane and urine on the other, "gives us a little extra energy", she says, and is "just enough to give it the boost to do what we need".

Heating urine before it goes through the membrane to be closer to the vapour state makes it more efficient, too, says Dr Parker.

More Technology of Business

She says her lab's waterless flush toilet is "basically ready and could be commercialised straight away".

A challenge now is making them feasible for rural areas - the membranes need cleaning every three months, which is more easily achieved in cities.

Reducing costs

While there is lots of innovation going on, the key challenge is making sanitation affordable, says Jack Sim, World Toilet Day founder.

He remembers growing up in Singapore in the 1950s and 60s and having to use his village's communal outhouse. It was a "very traumatic" experience, he says, involving buckets and lots of green flies.

Moving to public housing with a flushable loo was "like a miracle", he recalls.

Image copyright Jack Sim Image caption World Toilet Day founder Jack Sim (r) meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi

He believes people on low incomes need to be convinced to "sacrifice something else and build a toilet first".

But many promising products are now stuck in the "valley of death", says Duke University's Dr Hawkins.

This is the space between developing a successful prototype and "getting to a locked-down product you can scale up, mass produce, and find a market share".

The aim is to get the operating expenses of clean toilets down to five cents (3.8p) per person per day, he says.

And Neil Jeffery, chief executive of Water & Sanitation for the Urban Poor, a non-profit organisation focusing on African and Indian cities, points out that it's "not just about the toilets - it's about how you collect waste safely, transport it, treat it, and how it's then used".

Most African cities only have 10-15% of households connected to mains sewerage, he says, with many urban settlements sharing pit latrines instead.

When these fill up, a lorry needs to take their contents to a treatment plant.

Image copyright Crane Engineering Image caption Crane Engineering's waste treatment trucks will be trialled in 2019

But this can be a costly two- or three-hour drive, says Mark Hassman, project manager for the Mobile Septage Treatment System at Crane Engineering in Wisconsin.

He says the amount of waste that trucks actually bring to treatment plants is "less than 5% [of the total] in some cities".

Instead, they dump it in ditches, mix it with rubbish and burn it, or "plop it in a ditch, and if it's rainy season, it goes downstream".

Mr Hassman has been leading a team designing trucks that can process 70-80% of the waste on site. So instead of emptying two pits, "they can now maybe do eight in one drive, and that hopefully reduces the cost and enables people to afford clean pit emptying," he says.

He says the trucks are "fairly close" to producing potable water.

The trucks will have trial runs in Africa in 2019, and his company is "looking to get these units out there" commercially in 2020.

The crucial requirement is to create a market that enables companies to make a profit from loos that are also affordable for poorer households, he says.

Image copyright Crane Engineering Image caption Special treatment trucks can turn human waste into clean water

Lack of sanitation also has an economic impact.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has been running its Reinvent the Toilet Challenge since 2011, says "more than $200bn (£155bn) is lost due to healthcare costs and decreased income and productivity" as a result of poor sanitation.

This is one of the reasons why Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed $20bn to build 111 million latrines by 2019 - "the biggest toilet building project in the history of mankind", says Mr Sim.

The goal of sanitation for all may still be "some years" away. "But I can see this problem being solved in the next decade," he says.

Not a day too soon for the billions still suffering.

WILL GOMPERTZ REVIEWS THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB STARRING CLAIRE FOY ★★☆☆☆

The omens weren't good.

It was the evening after the heavily advertised nationwide release of The Girl in the Spider's Web: A New Dragon Tattoo Story, and the city centre cinema, where I went to see the film was as empty as a trickster's promise.

Such a pitiful showing would have been a dispiriting sight for the Sony Pictures execs who'd backed the movie to kick-start the stalled Millennium Series franchise. For those who didn't show up, rest easy - you made the right choice.

The fifth film to have been adapted from Stieg Larsson's best-selling Scandi-noir saga is easily the worst of the bunch.

And that's not because it is an adaptation of the fourth book in the series written after Larsson's death by David Lagercrantz (who also ghosted the best sports autobiography in living memory, I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic).

The problem with the film, nominally a psychological thriller, is that it is neither disturbing nor thrilling.

 Sony Pictures ReleasingThe Girl in the Spider's Web is an action-packed film, but lacks dramatic tension

It is a perfectly serviceable but very predictable action movie full of car-chase clichés and video game shoot-outs, powered by a plot that has about as much dramatic tension as a game of garden bowls.

The movie opens with the two young Salander sisters playing chess in their father's draughty and over-the-top eerie cliff-top concrete castle. When they finish the game their sexually abusive dad decides it's his turn to play with them.

Not nice.

Lisbeth hurls herself from a broken balcony into the deep snow below and legs it. Camilla stays.

 Sony Pictures ReleasingSylvia Hoeks plays Camilla, who is Lisbeth's sister

Cut to a couple of decades later and Lisbeth (Claire Foy) has moved into an industrial space in town that makes her dad's old place look cosy. Still, it matches her goth-punk aesthetic and cold-as-ice persona, which, in turn, fits with her life as a monosyllabic vigilante intent on dishing out the old electric cattle-prod treatment to an assortment of baddies.

"The sum of all my sins," replies the bearded Merchant.

It's not a great line in any circumstance, but is beyond limp coming from the mouth of a man who looks like his idea of being naughty is un-tucking his pyjama top.

Anyway, off Lisbeth goes, riding her black Ducatti motorbike with elbows out like wings, into a murky world of deadly Russians, decent Americans, and inscrutable Swedes. She is not entirely alone, as ever she can rely on a little help from a few geeky friends and her old chum and admirer Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason) an investigative journalist.

And that's it really.

The story unfolds as you would imagine with plot twists as surprising as getting a woolly jumper for Christmas.

Claire Foy does a reasonable job in a limited role, which offers precious little opportunity to flesh out her character beyond being a cartoonishly two-dimensional action hero blessed with the tech skills to put her in the running for Employee of the Month at PC World.

Who knows why the film's talented director Fede Álvarez (Don't Breath) has chosen to swap mind games for endless punch-ups and shots of laptop screens.

 Sony Pictures ReleasingDirector Fede Alvarez fails to capture the psychological depth of Larsson's work

It misses the point of Larsson's creation.

What makes the books so compelling, and the original film in which Noomi Rapace played Lisbeth, is the inner psychological drama that determines and informs each protagonist's actions and relationships.

 The Ronald Grant ArchiveNoomi Rapace won critical acclaim for her portrayal of Lisbeth in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but said she was "done" with playing the part

They are complicated, dark stories, populated by damaged and complex characters. They need time to evolve and unfold in their otherworldliness. The Girl in the Spider's Web doesn't allow for any of that. Instead we have yet another car chase to crack on with and an electric cattle prod to wield.

Why have dark and complicated when you can have simple and light?

The Girl in the Spider's Web still has her dragon tattoo but she's lost her soul.

NOVASAR: UK RADAR SATELLITE RETURNS FIRST IMAGES

 SSTLSydney Harbour: The famous bridge and opera house captured at night

Sydney Harbour and the Egyptian pyramids feature in the debut images from the first all-UK radar spacecraft.

NovaSAR was developed jointly by Surrey Satellite Technology Limited of Guildford and Airbus in Portsmouth, and launched to orbit in September.

Its pictures are now being assessed for use in diverse applications, including crop analysis, flood and forestry mapping, and maritime surveillance.

The intention ultimately is to fly a constellation of NovaSAR-like sats.

Such a network would enable repeat images of locations to be acquired more quickly - something that is important if changes detected in a scene require a rapid response. Reacting to an oil spill at sea would be a good example.

 AIRBUS DSNovaSAR has something of the look of a cheese-grater

Satellite radar's great advantage is that it sees the Earth's surface in all weathers and at night. Many other types of Earth observation (EO) spacecraft need daylight and cloud-free skies to gather their data.

The picture of Sydney Harbour, with its famous bridge and opera house, illustrates this point: it was taken after dark.

The image is resolving objects that are six metres across and larger.

"What interests me most in this picture are the boats," said Luis Gomes, the chief technology officer at SSTL.

"NovaSAR is seeing not only large vessels but also much smaller pleasure craft. We can't see the shape of them, but we can certainly see that they are there. And that's encouraging because one of the main objectives of NovSAR will be maritime surveillance," he told BBC News.

The satellite is equipped with a receiver that can pick up Automatic Identification System (AIS) radio signals.

These are the positional transmissions that large ships are obliged to broadcast under international law.

Vessels that tamper with or disable these messages very often are engaged in smuggling or illegal fishing activity.

If such ships appear in NovaSAR's radar pictures, they will be reported to the authorities.

 SSTLCairo: The radar picks up a range of different terrains

The Cairo scene, featuring the Great Pyramids, showcases the satellite's ability to discern different land uses.

The picture includes buildings, cultivated fields, trees, and desert/rock.

Martin Cohen, a radar expert with Airbus, commented: "The first image from orbit is always a key moment for everyone involved in such a mission, and this is no exception. The quality of the imagery is a credit to the hard work and dedication of the whole team here in Portsmouth.

"We look forward now to supporting SSTL through the rest of the commissioning phase, and seeing the mission begin full operational use."

There are a range of partners involved in assessing NovaSAR's capabilities. These include EO specialists in India and Australia. The UK's Ministry of Defence also wants to see what the spacecraft can offer Britain's armed forces.

UK engineers have long worked in space radar but their technology has previously always gone on broader missions, such as those for the European Space Agency. NovaSAR, in contrast, is solely a British initiative.

The UK government has invested £21m in the project. Science Minister Sam Gyimah said: "Yet again we can see UK research and innovation that is truly out of this world," he said.

"This 'eye in the sky' can capture an image a dozen times wider than the Strait of Dover and the data it provides can help crack problems from illegal shipping to alerting us to damaging pollution that needs to be countered."

AIRBNB SUED FOR PULLING WEST BANK SETTLEMENTS

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gidi hosts a property located in the West Bank and is disappointed at Airbnb's decision

Holiday homes rental giant Airbnb is being sued in a class action by a law firm in Jerusalem over its delisting of settlements in the occupied West Bank.

It accuses Airbnb of "grave and outrageous" discrimination for not applying the same standard in occupied areas in other parts of the world.

On Monday, Airbnb said it took the move because it viewed settlements as "core" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The step was hailed by Palestinians and denounced by Israel.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Maanit Rabinovich from the settlement of Kida, and, according to court papers, will seek compensation for other similarly affected holiday home-letters.

It accuses Airbnb of discriminating against Israelis because it continues to list holiday homes in places considered occupied in other geopolitical hotspots, such as Tibet and Northern Cyprus.

Airbnb says it is "evaluating" what to do about lettings in occupied territories in general.

Israel's tourism minister has denounced the firm's action against Jewish settlements as "shameful", and said Israeli authorities would back legal challenges against it.

The move, which affects 200 listings, has been widely praised by Palestinians and their supporters.

Jewish settlements in territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.

 ReutersKiryat Arba (above) is one of about 140 settlements in the occupied West Bank

The issue of settlements is one of the most contentious areas of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.

More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war.

The Palestinians see them as a major obstacle to peace and a barrier to a hoped-for Palestinian state on land which they occupy.

Israel says such an argument is a pretext for avoiding direct peace talks, and that the fate of settlements should be negotiated in accordance with peace accords signed with the Palestinians in 1993.

GOOGLE FINALLY CLEANS UP ITS ESTA ADS AFTER EIGHT YEARS

 USAEstaServiceGoogle removed an ad for this official-looking website

Google says it will stop ads for expensive unofficial Esta services appearing at the top of search results, eight years after the first complaints.

In 2010, the US started charging UK travellers to use the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (Esta).

Unofficial sites charging five times as much as the US government soon flooded the top of Google's search results, despite breaking Google's ad rules.

Now, after a BBC News investigation, Google says it is tackling the issue.

While unofficial Esta sites will still appear in the search results, they should no longer appear above the official website as advertisements when using the most common search terms.

Since it has used machine learning to address the issue, the ads do still show up for some search terms. Google says this will improve in time.

Why has this taken so long?

The official Esta website is run by the US Department for Homeland Security. It charges $14 (£10.70) for each Esta application.

But countless unofficial sites appeared at the top of Google search results by buying advertisements.

These unofficial sites charged more than $80 for an Esta application.

Google's advertising policies explicitly forbid "charging for products or services where the primary offering is available from a government or public source for free or at a lower price".

The company did take down ads that were manually reported by its users, but the same websites would soon reappear with a new web address.

It was a fruitless game of "whack a mole".

What has changed?

The BBC sent several unofficial Esta ads to Google and asked why they had been allowed to remain on the platform. One of the websites advertised on Google was charging $99 (£76) per Esta.

Google took the ads down, but others immediately filled the space.

 Bintech Advisers SLAn ad for this Esta site was also taken down

After the BBC supplied more of the unofficial Esta ads, Google said it would look into the problem. It later said it had been able to develop its machine learning process to wipe out the unofficial Esta ads.

Following the change, commonly used Esta search terms no longer carry ads for the unofficial services.

Some less common searches may still return ads while the algorithm continues to learn, but the most obvious ones such as "esta" should no longer show ads, it said.

Beyond Estas

Other countries including Australia and Canada also have travel permits similar to the Esta.

Just like the Esta, there are countless unofficial websites offering Australia ETA and Canadian ETA permits at inflated prices.

Ads for these services have also been prominent on Google. But the search giant said it would use the same machine learning systems to eliminate these too.

In a statement, Google said: "We know that people look to Google ads for information about where to get goods and services, so we are committed to ensuring that the ads they see are useful and relevant.

"We use a combination of algorithmic and human review to catch and remove bad ads; and we continue to update our policies and methods of enforcement."

It said it encouraged people to report ads that slipped through the system, so they could be manually reviewed.

'I HIRE A MAN TO PRETEND TO BE MY DAUGHTER’S DAD - AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW'

Megumi was a baby when her parents separated and her father disappeared from her life. But years later her mother told her he wanted to reconnect. Megumi began to see Yamada regularly. She thinks he is her father, and that Yamada is his real name - but this is a lie.

"Ever since she was little she'd ask me where he was," says Megumi's mother, Asako. "All she knew was that he had gone soon after she was born, so she blamed herself."

For years it didn't appear to be a problem. But when Megumi was about 10, Asako noticed a change in her daughter's behaviour.

"She didn't talk to me and became very quiet and withdrawn," Asako says.

"It took a long while to find out about the bullying."

Asako discovered that Megumi wasn't only blaming herself for her parents' breakup. Her classmates were also ostracising her because she didn't have a dad - children of single parents are often stigmatised in Japan.

Eventually she became so unhappy that she refused to go to school.

"She's my only child and it was breaking my heart to see her so sad," Asako says.

She tried to get the teachers at school to help, but when that failed another idea came into her head.

"All I could think about was, what if I found a man who was nice and kind, an ideal father, someone who would make her feel better?" Asako says.

She'd heard about relative rental agencies that could send an actor to play a guest at a wedding or go on a date - they are well established in Japan. So she contacted one to ask if they could also provide a fake dad. After auditioning five hopefuls, she settled on a man called Mr Takashi.

"I found him the easiest to talk to," Asako says. "He's very kind and sweet, so I just followed my instincts."

Takashi runs a rental agency with about 20 staff and more than 1,000 freelancers - men and women of different ages and backgrounds who can cater for almost any situation, taking on fake names, personalities and roles. They often have to lie, but they are very strict about not breaking the law.

As an actor himself, he's played boyfriends, businessmen, friends and fathers, and been a bridegroom at five fake weddings.

He prepares for his roles, he confesses, by watching Hollywood movies like Little Miss Sunshine, the Oscar-winning film about a dysfunctional family bonding on a road trip, and The Descendants, in which George Clooney plays an indifferent parent who suddenly has to embrace fatherhood after a family tragedy.

"I study these films, and memorise phrases and lines," Takashi says. "I take notes on how different family members interact and communicate, and what it takes to be a certain kind of father or husband. They help me understand different family dynamics and relationships."

Asako met Takashi several times to talk about the kind of father she wanted him to play to Megumi.

"My requests were very simple," she says. "Firstly, I wanted him to say how sorry he was that he couldn't be in Megumi's life until then. Secondly, I wanted him to listen to whatever she wanted to tell him."

Asako then told Megumi that her father had remarried and now had a new family, but that he had recently been back in touch because he wanted to see them again.

He was working, she said, as "an actor".

Megumi was shocked, but eventually agreed to meet him. And so, nearly 10 years ago, Takashi became Yamada, Megumi's father - his longest-running, and perhaps most ethically dubious role to date.

Takashi still remembers their first meeting.

"It was a very complex emotion that was there," he says. "She asked me why I hadn't come to see her before, and I felt her resentment."

As Yamada, Takashi began seeing Megumi and her mother a couple of times a month - joining them on days out, trips to the cinema and visiting for birthdays. And Asako says it didn't take long to see a real change in her daughter.

"After a while Megumi became much happier and more outgoing," she says. "She loved to talk, she was lively - she even wanted to go back to school, and that's when I thought, 'This has all been worth it!'"

One particular occasion sticks in Asako's mind - when she and Yamada were at Megumi's school parents' day.

"We were standing at the back of the classroom," Asako says. "She saw us together and kept on turning around to look at us. She had the biggest smile on her face and that made me really happy."

Takashi's services are not cheap. Each time Asako hires him to play Yamada she pays about 10,000 Yen, (about £70 or $90), and although she earns a decent salary she has to make savings elsewhere to afford it. But when she remembers how unhappy her daughter once was, she thinks it is money well spent.

Takashi also sees a difference in Megumi, from the quiet, hesitant girl that he first met.

"Gradually she became happier and more confident," he says. "I used to meet her with Asako, the three of us together, but one day she said, 'I want to go out with my father, just the two of us,' so I took her out and she held my hand for the first time."

Over the last 10 years, Takashi's character Yamada has grown very close to Megumi, now a young adult. He's become a part of the family. He even tells Megumi that he loves her, in the way that any father might - but, of course, he doesn't really.

How does he justify this act of deception?

"Switching personalities and identities is very important in this job," he says. "But I'm human, and so, of course, it would be a lie if I said I don't feel any emotional conflict saying, 'I love you,' to that child. But this is a business, I have to do it, and I have to keep reminding myself of that."

Asako also understands that some might disagree with her choices.

"I know what I'm doing is drastic," she says. "But I really, really wanted to save my daughter."

To complicate matters, she has also become very attached to the fictional character she is paying Takashi to portray.

"When the three of us are together, I feel at peace," she says.

"We talk, we laugh and we are very kind to each other. He's been in our lives for such a long time now, I would like to marry him and become a real family."

But Asako has had to face the bittersweet reality that she is in love with someone who isn't real and who cannot love her back.

"I have told him [how I feel], but he told me to my face that he's with us because it's his job. It's very complicated," she says.

"I'm very aware that he's only with us because we're paying him.

"I sort of fantasise about our relationship, that maybe we can be a real family, but the relationship as it is actually helps me emotionally and mentally as well. It keeps me stable."

In fact, Asako has no plans to end the arrangement with Takashi and says she would like to carry on hiring him to play Megumi's dad indefinitely - even if that means sinking deeper and deeper into a world of fantasy and deception.

"The ideal situation is that she continues to think of him as her father," she says. "So when she gets married I'd like him to be at her wedding ceremony, and when she has her own child, I'd like him to act as a grandfather as well. The worst case scenario is that my daughter finds out."

And if Megumi's real father were to ever turn up?

That's not a possibility that Asako has ever really considered. As she hasn't had any contact with him since their divorce she feels it is unlikely - but if he did walk through the door one day, she thinks Megumi would choose Yamada over her real dad, because they have such a good "father-daughter" relationship. He is the ideal father, just as Asako hoped he would be.

Takashi is also aware that the lie could continue to grow.

"This is one of the big issues of renting a family," he says. "Megumi could get married in the future and then her husband would think I'm her father. If she then has her own child that means she'd believe I'm the grandfather of her child, and the stakes get bigger and bigger."

And he has thought about how Megumi might feel if she finds out - though the plotlines he envisages might strike many as highly optimistic.

"In the best case scenario, I'd like to think that she might thank me for taking care of her - that is 80% of my imagination," he says.

"The other 20% thinks that she would be devastated. She might say, 'Why did you come clean? Why couldn't you just keep lying to me until the end?'

"I think I've been a big support in her life... Maybe asking her to thank me is a bit excessive, but at least I'd like her to recognise our service."

Many might also find it hard to understand why Asako has chosen to do something which could be so distressing for her daughter, if she discovers the truth. Yet she stands by her decision.

"I know some people think it's foolish to pay money to lie to my own daughter and to have a pretend father, but I was desperate," she says.

"Anyone can understand that horrible feeling of desperation, to see your child so hurt."

She says she does worry about the potential impact on Megumi, but tries not to think about it.

And she thinks this kind of thing happens more than you might imagine.

"My situation isn't unique. I'm sure there are loads more surrogate fathers and mothers out there."

All names have been changed to prevent Megumi uncovering the deception before her mother is ready to tell her

KEANU REEVES HAS A ROLE IN TOY STORY 4



Tim Allen has revealed Keanu Reeves has a part in the Toy Story 4 movie.

Speaking to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, Allen, who voices Buzz Lightyear in the movie franchise, hinted Reeves has a part similar to his own.

"Keanu Reeves has got a great part. Even he said, gentle wonderful guy that he is, 'this sounds too much like Buzz Lightyear' and his character does have an edge to that."

Allen said the fourth instalment was "deep and moving".

But he did not reveal any more details about Reeves' character, other than to say it is smaller than Buzz Lightyear.

Last week the first trailer for Toy Story 4 was released which revealed a new character Forky, a spork which has been turned into a toy as a craft project.

Forky is voiced by comedian Tony Hale, who has appeared in hit comedies Arrested Development and Veep.

 DisneyThe teaser trailer revealed Forky is in denial about being a toy

The film is directed by Josh Cooley and sees the toys end up on a road trip alongside old and new friends.

Allen said the film's last scene was very emotional.

"Hanks said it best - of course, he always says stuff best - but the last scene of that movie, I couldn't even get through it. and I thought there were pages after it.

"I read it and I had to turn around from looking at it in the studio, it was so emotional."

He compared it with the classic final scene of Gone With the Wind.

"It's a 'Scarlett, I don't give a damn moment'," he said.

Toy Story 4 is scheduled to be released in the UK on 21 June 2019.

WHY SWITZERLAND IS WORRIED ABOUT UK TRADE AFTER BREXIT



Ever since the UK voted to leave the European Union in 2016, Switzerland has been carefully watching Brexit proceedings.

The deal (or perhaps no deal) struck between the UK and the EU will be significant to non-EU member Switzerland. And it cannot come quickly enough for the Swiss.

"The clock is ticking," sighs Jan Atteslander of the Swiss business association Economiesuisse.

"We are worried, right now the rules are clear, we can trade [with the UK].

"But now we are coming to a corner, at the end of March, and no one can tell us if there will be a [Brexit] deal or not."

March is key because the UK is scheduled to leave the EU at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019.

But hang on a minute, why on earth should Switzerland, which never joined the EU, be worried about the status of its trade ties with the UK, which is about to leave?

The reason lies in Switzerland's own complicated bilateral deals with Brussels, negotiated over two decades, after the Swiss decided in 1992 not to join the EU.

 swissmemSwitzerland has a large and successful manufacturing sector

Now the 28-member EU bloc is Switzerland's biggest trading partner by far, and the UK, for now, is part of that.

"The close economic relations between Switzerland and the UK are based on the bilateral agreements between Switzerland and the EU," explains Ivo Zimmermann, who represents the Swiss machine tool industry. "So after Brexit these agreements will cease to apply."

Switzerland's machine tool sector - which makes everything from industrial drills to machines that can produce automotive parts - sold almost 2.5bn Swiss francs ($2.5bn; £2bn) of goods into the UK last year.

That is an amount of exports that Mr Zimmermann and his colleagues don't want to see change, except upwards.

Surely then, the canny Swiss have already drawn up a new trade deal with their UK partners?

Actually no, much to the frustration of Haig Simonian, who is vice-president of the British Swiss Chamber of Commerce.

"Britain's hands are tied, because under the arrangement with the EU, it can only start acting [securing new trade deals with non-EU nations], when it is no longer a member, he says.

"So, officially at least, everything is frozen."

Watch manufacturing is a key Swiss industry

This means that the Swiss cannot secure their own trade, customs, or movement of people agreements with the British until the UK and the EU have sealed their own accord.

When the UK government announced its planned Brexit deal last week, there was a brief sense of relief in Switzerland. But the sound and fury that then came from all political parties in the House of Commons soon ended that.

And, while government ministers in 27 EU capitals are studying that proposed withdrawal agreement, desks in the Swiss capital Berne are bare.

It is an awkward position for British-Swiss trade ties to be in. The two countries are among each other's largest trading partners, and have enjoyed stable economic ties for years.

In 2017 the UK was Switzerland's fifth biggest overseas market, with exports totalling 11.4bn Swiss francs, according to official Swiss figures.

Going in the other direction, UK exports to Switzerland in 2016 were valued at £21bn, its sixth largest.

"The fact is, any kind of uncertainty is poison for business, for investment, for any sort of decisions," says Mr Simonian.

 EPAUK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently visited Switzerland

The Swiss government has come up with a strategy to minimise uncertainty, quaintly called "Mind the Gap". The idea is to try to prevent a regulatory vacuum with the UK should the end of March arrive and a withdrawal deal with the EU has still not been agreed.

Pointing out the close ties Switzerland and the UK have - including 150 direct flights a day - Swiss government ministers have been beating a path to London for the last two years.

Not for official negotiations of course, but for informal talks. And rumour has it that things have been going well.

Global Trade

More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:

When the UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt paid a visit to Berne last month he told journalists it had been "an excellent visit", though he declined to answer any questions about what exactly was discussed.

Jan Atteslander confesses that he and his colleagues in Swiss business are eying some opportunities in a post-EU UK.

"The UK has a high-tech industry in industrial goods, in machining, and the car industry has developed very strongly," he says.

"Also in pharmaceuticals, the chemical industry is really top notch, it's a natural partner, because we are also innovation based."

The Swiss government is keeping a close eye on Theresa May's Brexit negotiations

Mr Simonian too sees openings for greater trade, though not, interestingly, in financial services, a sector in which both countries are already very strong.

"In the end they are very deep competitors [in the world of finance], so I would be cautious on that front," he says.

Given that all the ties between the UK and Switzerland will have to be rewritten, the Swiss could in theory opt for some kind of customs arrangement with the UK (if it is not in the EU customs union).

It could even perhaps maintain freedom of movement with the UK (the Swiss signed up to EU free movement years ago in order to gain access to the single market), if the UK thinks it might be worth hanging on to free movement with Switzerland alone.

But none of these options can be properly agreed, let alone put in place, until the UK and the EU finalise their deal. So are the Swiss confident about the future?

"Confident might be the wrong word," says Mr Zimmermann. "We know that the Swiss government is doing everything to ensure a smooth change… but there are still lots of uncertainties."

The end of March is four months away - not a long time to rewrite trade relations, as the seemingly endless negotiations between the EU and the UK have proven.

The Swiss don't like last-minute decisions, and they don't like delays. But for now, they will simply have to watch, and wait.

AT THANKSGIVING, DISCORDANT TRUMP HEADS SQUABBLING AMERICAN FAMILY

Mocked up picture of Pelosi, Trump and McConnell

The Thanksgiving holidays will provide little respite from rhetoric in a highly polarised US.

In this week of Thanksgiving, a holiday observed by most Americans regardless of creed, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation or politics, it seems untimely to talk of national discord and divisiveness.

However, a shared activity and shared menu of turkey, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie is something altogether different from a genuine act of commonality. In these angry times, America seems incapable of putting aside its differences, of truly coming together and even of engineering temporary political ceasefires.

Calamitous events are instantly politicised. Even as the death toll continues to mount in California, the wildfires have sparked rancorous debates about forestry policy and global warming. Terror attacks claimed by ISIS are invariably followed by rows about immigration.

Each successive multiple shooting fuels the unending fight between those who believe thoughts and prayers offer an adequate response and those demanding tighter controls on firearms and gun ownership.

The massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last month also shone a light on an alarming rise in anti-Semitism. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 57% spike in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017.



Donald Trump's visit to Pittsburgh, a customary presidential act at such times of bereavement, became contentious rather than communal, with a Jewish social justice group mounting street protests because of his unapologetic embrace of nationalism and his characterisation of some of hate-spewing racists in Charlottesville as "decent people".

This kind of protest, which drew widespread community support, would have been almost unthinkable under most recent presidents. Given the prevailing mood of acrimony, however, and Donald Trump's role in stoking it, it came as no surprise.

A deadly white nationalist rally shocked the nation a year ago in the small city of Charlottesville, Virginia

Even acts of sacred remembrance, such as the recent trip to France to mark the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War One, become needlessly controversial. Prior to Mr Trump heeding the advice of the Secret Service not to travel by motorcade to an American war cemetery when Marine One was grounded by bad weather, a decision seized upon by critics as a dereliction of presidential duty, the trip had already taken an ugly turn.

He arrived in France saying he planned to "celebrate" the end of World War One, a discordant choice of word. The moment Air Force One touched down in Paris, he also picked a fight with his host, the French president Emmanuel Macron. If ever there was a moment to observe a diplomatic ceasefire, surely it was the anniversary of the Armistice.

Long before Donald Trump arrived in Washington, the esteemed American political scientist James Q Wilson shrewdly observed: "Once politics was about only a few things. Today, it is about nearly everything."

That dictum seems especially pertinent now. Politics comes to the war cemeteries of France, to American football stadiums on a Sunday afternoon, to the charred cul-de-sacs of Paradise, California, to the National Cathedral in Washington.

When political leaders from both sides gathered there to remember the late Republican Senator John McCain, President Trump was deliberately excluded. John McCain decided before his death that a bipartisan coming together was possible only in the enforced absence of America's head of state, a view widely shared amongst those who packed the pews.

Division, of course, is nothing new. From the country's fractious founding through to the modern-day, this great American experiment has always been explosively combustible. Just visit the Civil War battlefields of Gettysburg, Antietam or Manassas; or the trouble-spots of the civil rights and Vietnam era, such as Birmingham, Selma, and the campuses of "Ole Miss" or Kent State University. The past forty years, if anything, have been relatively peaceable if measured in urban violence, political assassinations or '60s-style mass demonstrations.

But what makes this era so unsettling is the ingrained polarity of the politics.

During the civil rights era, when policy makers in Washington feared the country might be overwhelmed by the racial fury breaking loose in almost every major city, progressive Democrats and moderate Republicans joined forces to defeat segregationist Democrats and unsympathetic Republicans. The 1964 Civil Rights Act, which sounded the death knell for southern segregation, would never have been enacted were it not for bipartisanship.

Likewise during Watergate, Democrats and Republicans buried their differences to serve the national interest and to avert a full-blown constitutional crisis. Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee joined Democrats in voting to subpoena those incriminating White House tapes. Moderate Republicans helped draft articles of impeachment - though Richard Nixon resigned, of course, before they were put to a full vote of the House of Representatives. The poser of the famed question, "What did the president know and when did he know it?" was not some liberal firebrand but rather Senator Howard Baker, a Republican from Tennessee.

Gone, it seems, is an era when moments of national mourning and commemoration, such as the Challenger space shuttle disaster or the 40th anniversary of the D-Day landings, were politically benign; when a US president could speak on behalf of all of his compatriots, as Ronald Reagan did so memorably on both occasions. But it is also important to point out that the politicisation of national tragedies and convulsions by no means started with Donald Trump.

Along with the soothing words uttered by Bill Clinton in response to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, when 168 people were murdered in a domestic terrorist truck bombing, came an attack on unnamed right-wing figures whom he accused of recklessly stoking anti-government sentiment - the "loud and angry voices in America today," as he put it, "whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible." It was a valid point to make, but also a highly political one at a time of national grieving. For a president then struggling for relevancy in the aftermath of the Republican Revolution in 1994, Clinton saw in the rubble of the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building a partisan opportunity. The bombing marked the turning point of his troubled first term, and the start of a comeback that culminated two years later in his re-election.

The attacks of September 11th offer another case study. The national unity and patriotic bipartisanship - crystallised on the floor of a joint session of Congress when then-Democratic Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle hugged George W Bush - proved short-lived. In the run-up to the Iraq war, the White House pushed through a war authorisation vote ahead of the 2002 congressional mid-terms, seeking to tag Democrats who opposed it as soft on terrorism. President George Herbert Walker Bush, by contrast, had waited until after the 1990 mid-terms to seek congressional approval for the first Gulf War, a deliberate act of depoliticisation.

What marks out Donald Trump is the speed and apparent relish with which he douses these moments of crisis and mourning with politics. Divisiveness is his default setting, conflict defines his presidency, and though he often pays lip service to national unity in scripted comments and formal statements, his authentic self usually finds quick expression on Twitter. His talent lies in being a partisan attack dog rather than a national consoler.

This month's midterm congressional elections, at which a divided nation produced a divided result, highlighted America's disunity. They reinforced a historic realignment where Democratic strength is now concentrated in the cities and their suburbs, and Donald Trump's America lies beyond.

The political map, rendered in deeper shades of red and blue, looks more partitionist. Almost the entire western seaboard and most of the northeast coastline is now Democratic. On a road trip hugging the Pacific Ocean, you could travel from the southernmost tip of California to the northern-most tip of Washington state and step foot in only one congressional district represented by a Republican. New York City no longer has a single Republican congressman or congresswoman.

Conversely, the landlocked states of America look like a giant red sea, save for a few isolated blue archipelagos.

Though it is an exaggeration to speak of political no-go areas for the Republicans and Democrats, large swathes of the United States resemble one-party fiefdoms. Texas hasn't elected a Democratic Senator since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988. That was also the year California last voted in a Republican Senator. It should come as no surprise that the new Congress convening in January will be the most ideologically polarised in decades.

Donald Trump is not the cause of this disunity. His victory in 2016 was the culmination of a politics that has continually become more wilfully and aggressively partisan. Both Democrats and Republicans have accelerated this trend. His presidency, however, has widened and deepened the breach. His political business model, after all, has long been based aggravating points of cultural, economic and racial contention, whether on birtherism or immigration. At his rallies, he often looks and sounds more like the leader of a cult than the leader of a nation.

As he told rally-goers in West Virginia ahead of the mid-terms, in one of those inadvertently insightful sound-bites he delivers from time to time: "It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having ten thousand people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people."

The problem for Trump is not the ongoing adulation of rally-goers. Even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue, as he once famously boasted, some would probably not cast off their Make America Great Again caps. It is the wider audience outside. Though his blue-collar base remains solid, and his strength in rural states helped the Republicans retain control of the Senate, the mid-terms became a revolt of white-collar suburban voters. This was especially true of college-educated women, whose unexpectedly high support for him in 2016, even in the aftermath of the Access Hollywood comments, helped him beat Hillary Clinton. For all the polarity, moderates and registered independents can still sway presidential elections.

The mid-terms suggested that the America turned off by Donald Trump is more heavily populated than the America happy with his performance as president. Even in the Senate, where Trump interpreted the results as validation of his leadership, preliminary vote tallies suggest some 45 million Americans cast their votes for Democratic Senate candidate, as opposed to 39.3 million for Republican candidates.

Presidents commonly rebound after mid-term setbacks, as Barack Obama did in 2012 and Bill Clinton did in 1996. Trump's three predecessors were all two-term presidents. The Electoral College means he could lose the popular vote by a heavy margin, as he did in 2016, and still win the White House. Also it would be an act of analytical folly to write him off, a repeat of the colossal mistake so many pundits made in 2016.

However, as the respected political statistician Nate Silver noted earlier this week: "His base alone will not be enough to win a second term."

In 2016, Donald Trump benefited from the politics of division. But this avowed nationalist has struggled to be a truly national leader. The polarisation which fuelled his rise also has the potential to bring about his fall.

CAN 'VOLUNTARY COLONIALISM' STOP MIGRATION FROM AFRICA TO EUROPE?

Many Africans risk their lives to cross the Mediterranean

A controversial proposal by a German minister that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to curb migration has been rejected by the African Union, writes the BBC's Dickens Olewe.

The European Union, or a body like the World Bank, should build and run cities in Africa in order to boost job creation and development on the continent, Germany's Minister for Africa, Gunter Nooke, told the BBC in an interview in which he outlined his thinking on how to stem migration to Europe.

This will mean African countries leasing their land to a foreign body to "allow free development for 50 years", Mr Nooke said.

It is a controversial idea, rejected by critics as reeking of colonialism. But others - like Carol Musyoka, an academic at Strathmore Business School, one of Kenya's top universities - are open to the concept.

In a BBC interview, Ms Musyoka described the proposal as "fascinating", and said she would support it if it was a genuine attempt to ensure that Africans - not foreign powers - benefited.

Lagos is predicted to have 30 million people by 2050 - and will struggle to create jobs for them all

American Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Romer developed the idea a decade ago.

In 2009, he said developing countries should consider surrendering part of their territory to foreign states which would then build what he called "charter cities" from the ground up.

The cities, he added, would operate under a set of laws separate from the host country.

'Hong Kong of Central America'

In 2008, Madagascar's then-President Marc Ravalomanana expressed interest in implementing the plan in the Indian Ocean island following a meeting with Mr Romer.

He said two such cities would be built where locals and migrants from neighbouring states could live.

The opposition accused Mr Ravalomanana of treason, and organised protests which killed the idea and helped trigger his downfall in 2009.

Honduras' then-President Porfirio Lobo Sosa also expressed support for the idea, saying in 2011 that "charter cities" would improve the lives of Hondurans by offering competitive jobs, better health and education, and a "top class" legal and security system.

The independent Honduran La Prensa newspaper said at the time that the plan would make the country "the Hong Kong of Central America".

Mr Sosa failed to implement it, following a backlash from critics opposed to Honduras losing control over its territory.

As in Europe, migration is a toxic political issue in the Americas and many Hondurans are part of the migration caravan moving towards the US border.

The current Honduran government hopes that the creation of what it calls special economic zones (SEZs) will boost development.

Although it has not fully outlined its plans, it has said that the SEZs would fall under foreign laws and foreign judges as this would make Honduras more attractive to Western investors, according to BBC Mundo's Luis Fajardo.

"We believe that when these special economic zones come to life and people see how successful they are in terms of generating employment, the politicians from all the states [in Honduras] will ask for it," Economics Minister Arnaldo Castillo told the BBC.

'Crazy idea'

But resistance to the idea remains strong, with many poor Hondurans believing the SEZs will only benefit the rich, and will create extended gated communities which will living under rules separate from the rest of the country, Fajardo said.

Thousands of Hondurans have been fleeing the country in search of a better life in the US

Mr Romer, in a 2011 TED Talk, argued that foreign-run cities could be a model of efficient governance and offer a good quality of life, stopping people from migrating for economic reasons.

Some proponents of the idea see Hong Kong as a model. They argue that the Chinese territory owes its economic development to when it was under British control between 1841 to 1997.

Mr Nooke sees the cities as economic bases that would also provide education to young Africans.

"The basic idea is that these free cities will create growth and prosperity," he told the BBC.

However, some warn the plan will not work.

"Creating an enclave economy would be a crazy idea," Ken Opalo from Georgetown University in the US warned.

Such cities would trigger internal migration, and not benefit the whole economy or fix the myriad problems African states are grappling with, he said.

"However messy or corrupt, it would be best to work through state institutions," Mr Opalo said, adding that the best way to help the continent is to invest in small and medium-sized businesses to create employment.

The African Union's (AU) Director of Communication, Leslie Richer, also rejected the idea of foreign-run cities, saying it "is a lazy answer" to concerns about migration and "implies that Africa needs to give up sovereignty and accede to 'management' by international organisations".

'Voluntary colonialism'

The AU's development plan, called Agenda 2063, is diametrically opposed to Mr Nooke's.

"I envision that our own African growth model will drive an African miracle. Sustained high economic growth in the continent will be driven by African unity and political and economic integration," the AU envoy for Infrastructure Development, Raila Odinga, said.

Hong Kong is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in

But Mr Nooke is determined to pursue the idea of foreign-run cities, saying it "must be conceived in such a way that any conflict will be avoided" between European and African governments.

Ms Musyoka is among Africans who hope such cities will be built, saying she will accept "voluntary colonialism" because of the failure of many African governments to provide a better life for their people.

Her view will make the founding fathers of independent Africa turn in their graves, but it could gain currency among young Africans risking their lives to reach Europe to escape poverty, corruption and inefficiency.

BREXIT: MAY GAMBLES ON LAST-MINUTE DASH TO BRUSSELS

 Adrian Dennis/Is Theresa May facing a dramatic showdown with EU leaders on Sunday?

Why is Theresa May rushing to Brussels on Wednesday when she has a fair few political headaches to contend with back home, and when she's due back here in just a few days for the seal-the-deal Brexit summit of EU leaders?

The answer: the prime minister wants to show she is fighting until the very last moment to get the best Brexit deal possible out of the EU.

Her Wednesday afternoon visit to see Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, provides her with a floodlit platform to do so.

Now, the plan had been for the two leaders to discuss a draft text of the political declaration on post-Brexit EU-UK relations.

Mrs May wanted to push for even closer trade ties than the EU has been willing to concede so far without the UK staying in the single market.

Essentially she is very, very keen for her Chequers proposal for Brexit (viewed in EU circles as cherry-picking non plus ultra) to be reflected in the document.

However, the Brexit process has now got a lot more complicated - meaning that the draft text on EU-UK future relations hasn't been finished in time for the prime minister to pick over.

You see, it's no longer just a matter of Mrs May wanting more from the EU.

A number of EU countries are suddenly pushing for a lot more from the British prime minister. For France, it's about fishing rights; for Spain, it's about the status of Gibraltar.

Others, meanwhile, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, think she should be getting a whole lot less when it comes to the UK-wide customs union, envisaged as part of the backstop for the Irish border. They want the UK to be tied tighter to EU environment regulations, for example, to avoid UK business having a competitive advantage over Europeans.

As for the PM's Chequers plan for trade and security (much maligned back in the UK, too, of course), Germany has said loud and clear it won't allow the political declaration on future EU-UK relations to be a means of what Berlin describes as "Chequers by the back door".

It is highly unlikely that all this can be sorted out in just one meeting between Mrs May and the European Commission chief.

So the big question is: will the draft text on EU-UK future relations be ready by the end of the week to give EU leaders at least one day to digest it? Or are the stars aligning for a dramatic showdown between those leaders and the UK prime minister at their Sunday summit?

One EU diplomat predicted possible similarities with a nail-biting, marathon summit at the height of the Greek debt crisis.

During the all-night meeting, Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was invited to make his case to eurozone leaders on a number of occasions, before being sent out of the room to allow those leaders to decide the economic fate of his country amongst themselves.

EU rules do not allow Mrs May to negotiate Brexit with EU leaders directly. If a number of issues remain open on Sunday, their Brexit summit could turn out to be a lot, lot longer than the two-hour signing session and photo op originally envisaged.

The last question I'm going to ask in this post now is: could this all be more about optics than nitty-gritty politics?

Grumbling aside, no-one in European circles seriously thinks any EU country will refuse to sign up to the Brexit deal by end of play this weekend.

They're all keen to avoid a no-deal scenario and they want to help Mrs May get the Brexit texts through a vote in the House of Commons.

Engaging in last-minute political fisticuffs with the EU is arguably advantageous for her.

A high-drama, climactic Brexit summit ending in a late night/early morning bleary-eyed but triumphant resolution with EU leaders would allow Mrs May to claim that the final text of the deal was hard fought and hard won… in the fervent hope that will soften the stance of some of her many critics at home.

ARE FRENCH RIOTS A CURSE OR A BLESSING FOR MACRON?



Ever since his election campaign, Emmanuel Macron has been keen to prove he's not afraid of French protesters. Where previous governments have blinked, Mr Macron has stared down the unions, weathered their protests, and pushed through difficult reforms on labour laws, and railway workers' pension rights.

But protests over fuel prices this month are presenting him with a new kind of political challenge. This is a protest with no official leader, no national organisation, not run by any union or political party; a protest that feels distinctly spontaneous, individual and diverse. And that diversity is key - both to its importance, and to its potential weakness.

Last weekend, more than 280,000 people dressed in high-visibility jackets blocked roads across France in protest at rising taxes on diesel and petrol, which the government says are to fund eco-friendly projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A small number of hard-core protesters have continued blocking roads and petrol stations this week, and calls have gone out on social media for a second national demonstration this weekend - urging protesters to converge on the capital. So who are the men and women in the hi-vis vests?

"It's the France of the majority, who work, who are not marginalised, who struggle to make ends meet and often end the month in the red, "explains political author Jérôme Sainte-Marie, who has written a book on democratic changes in France.

That majority of struggling families and workers, many of them from France's rural areas or the run-down suburbs that ring its major cities, crosses political party lines, he says, which makes this protest quite unlike the predictable, highly choreographed marches of France's unions or political groups.

President Macron's popularity is slumping, according to some polls

"It's a movement that goes beyond political differences and that's dangerous for Emmanuel Macron," Saint-Marie explains. "As long as the opposition to Macron is split between left and right, his power isn't challenged. The gilets jaunes (yellow vests) are a kind of social reunification of the opposition that goes beyond political divisions."

Michel Pigenet, a social historian at the Pantheon-Sorbonne University in Paris, agrees. "Anti-tax movements are generally a right-wing cause, but the cost of living is a left-wing issue. There's clearly a will - like Macron himself - to generate a movement that is neither left nor right," he says.

He believes that the gilets jaunes, with their unstructured approach, are a new kind of movement for France, not seen since before the Revolution in 1789, and says the movement "poses a serious political question".

There's lively debate here about the true nature of the protests - whether the movement is being steered by hard-right agitators, or hijacked by political interests. But for every one out blocking roads, there seem to be many French citizens supporting them at home. A survey by the polling agency Elabe found that almost three-quarters of French voters approved of the protests, and that more than half of those who voted for Mr Macron support them.

Several of the main opposition parties have publicly backed them, including the centre right Republicains, the far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon and his far-right rival Marine Le Pen.

"We don't want anyone using our movement, and we don't want leaders," said Frank Buhler, a prominent member of the gilets jaunes. "We have to start all over again, that's how far we've come. The French Revolution started with flour wars; for us it's fuel taxes."

The protests have spread throughout France

Most people agree this is about much more than fuel taxes. It's about the economic policies of President Emmanuel Macron in the face of growing frustration from low- and middle-income workers about making ends meet.

Mr Macron has presented himself as a president brought to power on the back of a grassroots movement, who could heal the rift between voters and leaders, and rebuild trust in democracy among those who felt disillusioned and detached from politics.

Since then, his campaign - like his leadership - has been criticised for being too rigid, too hierarchical, too arrogant and aloof. Now, with has approval ratings falling steeply, he's faced with a real grassroots movement, what will his response be?

The government has put forward a package of 500 million euros to support poorer households in meeting their energy costs. And last week, Prime Minister Eduoard Philippe told a radio programme that he understood the protesters' anger, and defended their right to mobilise. But, he said, the fuel taxes and other economic policies would stay.

Perhaps the government is right not to seem panicked. The surprise success of the gilets jaunes last weekend was based on a spontaneity that's hard to sustain; the French daily newspaper, Le Figaro, has already begun profiling its emerging leaders.

And the diversity that until now has proved such an effective unifier of opposition to the president, may ultimately prove to be its undoing.

"There is general agreement right now, but none of us believe the same thing," says protester Frank Buhler. "We all sing the Marseillaise and call for Macron's resignation - those are the two slogans of the movement. When Macron stands down, we will no longer agree, but right now we walk hand-in-hand. The politics will come later."

THE RISE AND FALL OF A BUSINESS COLOSSUS

 Reuters

It's hard to overstate the stature of Carlos Ghosn - and not just in the car-making world.

His position atop an empire comprising three of the world's biggest manufacturers - Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi - made him the leader of a trailblazing global alliance. He is/was one of the most influential and powerful business leaders anywhere in the world.

His downfall comes as a big shock. He was well known and widely liked by journalists mainly thanks to his generosity with his time and his habit of making headline-grabbing comments - like a Jose Mourinho of business leaders.

Carlos Ghosn was both a business visionary and - it now seems - a traditional character in a very familiar business fable.

An alliance between three global manufacturers was something not seen before in the car industry and was his personal creation. Saving a beleaguered Nissan and teaming it up with a European giant like Renault was arguably something only he - a French citizen (Brazilian birth and Lebanese descent) who saved Japan's treasured Nissan could have done.

Electric car party

Although known as "le cost killer" his easy cross-cultural charm was able to build a bridge between two manufacturers who were (and many will tell you still are) naturally suspicious of each other.

After adding Mistubishi as the third leg of the stool, the alliance he built now produced 10 million cars last year putting it behind only Volkswagen as a volume manufacturer.

With his superstar status assured he had the licence to make bold moves. He was very early to the electric car party - evangelising about their imminent surge and putting his money where his mouth was by investing heavily in the technology despite a sceptical motoring press.

Except it wasn't his money. It was Nissan's money. The same money that reportedly bought him four houses dotted around the world for his personal use only at a cost of £15m.

Sun Kings and scandals

It is in that regard he also embodies another important business phenomenon - the classic tale of the boss-turned-emperor.

"L'etat c'est moi" said Louis XIV. In their own ways, and to greatly varying extents, so have other long serving chief executives. Lord Browne who led BP for 12 years and masterminded the megamerger with US giant Amoco was called "the Sun King" by employees. His reign ended after controversy surrounding his private life.

Sir Martin Sorrell who turned a shopping basket company into a £20bn media giant stood down after 33 years amid claims, which he denies, that he spent company money on personal activities.

These leaders are not nearly as dastardly as Mirror Group's Sir Robert Maxwell or Polly Peck's Asil Nadir - both of whom stole millions from the companies they founded.

But they tell a familiar story of the feted, long-serving boss for whom the board meant to control them became toothless and irrelevant as the lines between the company and the individual became blurred.

Breeding frustration

So what's the answer?

The US political system has decided that term limits are the answer to stop the president becoming imperial. Although some organisations, like Deloitte, do impose time limits on their chief executive and chair roles (at Deloitte's, those roles are limited to two consecutive four-year terms) - these are generally used in partnerships where the chief executive role is very different to that in a publicly listed company.

Maybe there is no way to alter this age old trajectory. Success breeds confidence as the boss think that the success is entirely down to them, which breeds intolerance of other views, that breeds resentment which prompts frustrated subordinates and whistle-blowers to look for misconduct, which creates a scandal, which ruins legacies - as this one threatens to do to Carlos Ghosn.

As he once said himself. "If you have not been a villain at a certain point in time, you will never be a hero. And the day you are a hero, you may become a villain the next day."

THE DUP'S BREXIT MESSAGE TO THERESA MAY

 PA

Forget for a moment the "will they, won't they" numbers game.

Unless and until the head honcho of the Tories' backbench committee receives 48 letters there won't be a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.

As far as we know tonight the total has not yet been reached.

One of those who has submitted their letter told me in no uncertain terms "where are the others?" - frustrated that many of his colleagues seem to have promised to be part of the action, but reinforcements are yet to arrive.

If and when that threat can more clearly be seen to have retreated, there's a lot to be said about the true power of backbench Brexiteers. But as of the time of writing we are not there yet and who knows, in a matter of hours, the putsch could suddenly be back on.

Something very worrying however for Number 10 has just happened for real, more important in this moment than the potential threat from their own backbenches.

The DUP, crucial to Theresa May holding on to power, has just abstained in votes on the finance bill. In other words, they decided not to back the prime minister on the Budget.

Why? We know that the DUP is furious about the compromises that Number 10 has made to get their draft deal with the EU.

And they want to show, loudly and clearly, that they are not on board.

A senior DUP source has just told me tonight's votes were deliberately designed to "send a message to Theresa May that if she wants to continue down the road of the withdrawal agreement and its effect on the Union then there will be repercussions in the Commons".

"She could be leading them to a very bad place," they continued. "Tory MPs need to realise that their jobs, their majorities, their careers depend on a good working relationship with the DUP and May doesn't appear to be listening."

Ouch. The DUP says this is not the end of the arrangement of so called "confidence and supply" agreement, where the government can formally rely on support from the Northern Irish unionists' 10 votes.

But the fabric of that arrangement is certainly torn... And once faith is broken between the two, it's hard to see how it could be restored.

Remember, there's a really straightforward reason why this matters so much. Theresa May does not have enough votes on her own to pass the Brexit deal.

The partnership with the DUP was set up to try to make sure she could. If it collapses completely then her central task becomes yet more seemingly impossible, even if those 48 letters never come.

IS FACEBOOK A FRIEND TO LOCAL JOURNALISM?

/BBC

Facebook, often seen as one of the factors behind the decline of local newspapers, has unveiled a scheme to train reporters to work in local communities across the UK.

The social media giant is giving £4.5m ($5.7m) to local newspaper groups, which will hire around 80 people to spend two years training to be community reporters.

The scheme, to be administered by the National Council for the Training of Journalists, is designed, in Facebook's words, "to encourage more reporting from towns which have lost their local newspaper and beat reporters".

Now cynics might suggest that part of the reason those reporters have gone is that Facebook has run off with a large slice of the local advertising revenues, which used to support those jobs.

After all, the company reported UK revenues of £1.27bn last year, while Britain's largest local newspaper group Johnston Press earned only £100m from advertising - and has had to be rescued from collapse as its debts threatened to sink it.

But at the press conference unveiling the scheme, executives from the Archant and Reach local news groups were determined to be positive.

Their new trainees would be embedded in local communities underserved at the moment - "getting right to the heart of those communities, building relationships, and covering those subjects which aren't necessarily part of the big news agenda, but reflect the everyday lives of people we want to reach".

That all sounds laudable but what happens to these community reporters at the end of the two-year training period when Facebook stops paying for them? If this kind of ultra-local reporting isn't commercially viable now, why will things have changed?

There was no real answer from the local newspaper executives, and when I asked them to quantify the damage done to their businesses by Facebook over recent years, I was told that the launch was all about an initiative that would be beneficial to both sides.

The newspapers do get some much-needed cash for training - though around half as much as is being spent per year on the BBC Local Democracy scheme which uses licence fee revenue to fund newspaper reporters covering local authorities.

'Great content'

But what is in it for Facebook?

"We want people to come together and connect through great content," says Nick Wrenn, the firm's head of news partnerships in Europe.

"We want communities to be informed and I don't think you can do that without strong local journalism."

News organisations may, however, be a bit wary when Facebook talks of mutually beneficial partnerships. For one thing, what it means by the "great content" which will bring people together - this keeps changing with every tweak of the algorithm that powers its News Feed.

A couple of years ago, many news organisations "pivoted" to video, convinced by Facebook that this was the route to huge audiences and revenues. Now many video journalists have been laid off after the crowds and the cash failed to materialise.

At the beginning of this year, the News Feed was revamped to favour posts and videos from your friends and family, rather than those from businesses and news organisations.

Facebook may aspire to boost the local content its users see, but right now regional newspaper groups don't appear to be benefitting.

Any journalist will welcome the recruitment of 80 new community reporters, but unless their stories reach plenty of Facebook users and advertisers, this initiative could prove to be another blind alley.

WHAT SINGLE WORD DEFINES WHO YOU ARE?

Imagine you and an intelligent robot are both before a judge who cannot see you. The judge will guess which of you is the human, and so will live, while the other will die. Both you and the robot want to live. The judge is fair and smart. The judge says: “You must each give me one word from an English dictionary. Based on this word, I will guess who is the human.”

What one word do you choose?

Would it be some lofty spiritual concept like “soul”? Something that reflects your own tastes, like “music”? Or a base bodily function, like “fart”?

This simple thought experiment may seem fanciful, but some cognitive scientists believe that its consideration can help to illuminate our basic assumptions about artificial intelligence while also revealing some surprising insights about our own minds.

You might also like:

After all, automated ‘chat bots’ and language generating machines increasingly employ artificial intelligence to hold conversations with us or write reams of text that we encounter on a daily basis. How can we tell that the customer service representative we are chatting to online, for example, is a real person or a chirpy algorithm? Or if a fictional story was churned out by a machine rather than lovingly crafted by a human writer? Communicative AI is no longer a purely theoretical prospect and we need to be prepared to deal with it.

John McCoy, one of the researchers behind the research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says he was initially inspired by a casual conversation with his colleagues. They were discussing the Turing Test, first developed by British scientist Alan Turing in 1950, that aims to measure whether a machine’s intelligent behaviour is indistinguishable from that of a human.

In the most common formulation, each judge is given a standard chat interface. In each trial, they may be talking to a real human, or a computer chatbot powered by artificial intelligence – and the judge’s job is to guess which it is. If the chatbot manages to fool a pre-determined number of judges, it has passed the Turing Test.

“We wondered what would be the minimal version of the Turing Test that one could come up with” – John McCoy

“We wondered what would be the minimal version of the Turing Test that one could come up with,” explains McCoy, before speculating whether it could even be captured in a single word. “Then the question was, what were the words that people would actually say?” It was this question that would ultimately inspire a research paper, published this year in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.

In the first experiment, McCoy and his colleague, Tomer Ullman, asked more than 1,000 participants to answer the question above and then analysed the words they produced to find any common patterns.

The top 10 words, in order of popularity, were:

Love (134 responses)

Compassion (33)

Human (30)

Please (25)

Mercy (18)

Empathy (17)

Emotion (14)

Robot (13)

Humanity (11)

Alive (9)

“It was striking how much convergence there was between people,” says McCoy, who is now at the University of Pennsylvania. “They can choose any word they like from a standard English dictionary and yet there’s huge convergence across individuals.”

Consider the word “love” – around 10% of participants chose this word over all of the other hundreds of thousands of possibilities; overall, a quarter of all the participants chose one of the top four words.

In terms of the general themes, they found that words conveying bodily functions (such as “poop”), faith and forgiveness (such as “mercy” or “hope”), emotion (such as “empathy”) and food (such as “banana”) were the most popular categories.

McCoy and Ullman then performed a second experiment to see how other people would respond to the words generated in the first experiment. Were the most popular items really as successful at conveying a sense of humanity as the original participants had suspected? And if so, which were best?

To find out, the researchers paired the most popular words together in various combinations (such as “human” and “love”) and asked another group of participants to determine which, of the two, was most likely to have been generated by a human and which by a computer.

Knowingly flouting a taboo and provoking an emotion might be the most straightforward way of conveying your shared humanity

As we saw in the first study, “love” turned out to one of the most successful. But of the choices available, the highest-ranking word was “poop”. It may seem surprising that faeces turns out to be a human shibboleth, but the results suggest that knowingly flouting a taboo and provoking, rather than simply describing, an emotion might be the most straightforward way of conveying your shared humanity. Other, more colourful, terms could also spring to mind.

Some of the other words seen as uniquely human evoked similarly strong emotional responses that went beyond their dictionary definition. “Moist”, for example, or “please”. Others are just enjoyable to say. Try rolling “onomatopoeia” around your mouth a few times.

The reason for this might be a fair reflection of the current state of AI. While bots can now write basic descriptive sentences and even intelligible short stories, they still struggle with humour and sarcasm. Humour, after all, requires a deep understanding of context and the many cultural associations that are embedded in each word.

Besides these whimsical speculations, McCoy suspects that this experiment could prove a useful tool to understand people’s implicit assumptions about other groups of humans. What one word would you choose to prove you are a woman, for instance? Or to prove you are French, or a socialist? In each case, the choices should reveal the qualities that we assume all group members to recognise within themselves, that may be misunderstood or ignored by outsiders.

In the meantime, McCoy has found that the Minimal Turing Test is a useful provocation for further debate about the nature of AI. “It’s been fun to ask eminent psychologists this question, to see them think really, really hard and for them to come back hours later to excitedly change their answer,” McCoy says. “This very simple question just gets you thinking deep thoughts about the human versus the computer and how they communicate.”

His own favourite was deceptively simple. “One of the words I liked was ‘err…’ – that was clever,” McCoy says.

In general, though, it is worth remembering that if you ever do need to prove yourself as a human in a world increasingly run on machines, be crude, and be funny.

THIS 85-YEAR-OLD TEXAN CAN’T WAIT TO PICK YOU UP

After 58 years in the insurance industry, John Marston retired at 82. He did some fishing, and spent time with his family in his home city of Dallas in the US state of Texas. After so many years working actively, however, ‘Papa John’ (as known to his family) was anxious to do something again with his free time.

At the suggestion of his eldest grandson, Papa John explored driving in the gig economy. The idea was not outlandish – many baby boomers are performing a career second act in the on-demand labour market with skills they already have. Some are developing new talents and interests entirely.

The gig economy is providing an opportunity for boomers who have not saved enough while planning for retirement to bolster their nest egg – of which there are many. The World Economic Forum estimates the current pension savings gap for the eight largest retirement economies – including the US and UK – at $70tn; by 2050, it is projected to grow to $400tn due to longer lifespans, poor financial literacy, low savings rates and other factors.

For others, social interaction allows them to stay sharp, up to date with technology, and involved with their communities. This, Papa John says, is what has kept him driving rideshare more than two and a half years later. (Although he certainly enjoys the extra cash in his pockets at the end of the day as well.)

Night riders: The secret behind this BMX club's success

The story behind Peckham BMX where kids and teens compete to be the next Olympic champion.

PARKLIFE

Nigel the coach

Nigel Whyte is 48. He has three sons, two are in the British BMX Olympic Team. He's fit and full of energy. The club members young and old love him.

“I was always a footballer. I made it to semi pro. One season I was playing for three different teams at once,” he says. “I was always the guy up first thing in the morning waking everyone else up.”

On one of my visits, it’s a damp autumn night and I’m at the track-side with two dads. Training should have ended half an hour ago and some of the mums point at their watches. But Nigel is miles away, watching from the centre of the track high up like the captain at the helm. The dads tell me he's brilliant.

Later, Nigel explains the passion he has for helping the kids. “Even if it’s for two hours then it’s two hours well spent, a distraction - especially for the naughty kids. Those kids who might be going back to nothing. For me, it’s the whole thing. I say to them: 'Have you kept your bike clean?’ When they do then I know they are keeping their rooms at home clean. ‘Have you prepared your kit for tonight's session?’ I ask them. If they have, then I know they are preparing their homework.”

The club runs like clockwork. CK asks a rider if he arrived on time when he's leaving. He didn't and CK asks him in a firm but friendly way to work towards that goal, to get serious.

While we’re chatting, a procession of small kids on tiny bikes wearing their crash helmets, line up to shake Nigel's hand. They want to show him they are ready to ride. He greets every one of them in turn by name.

Later, Esreal, tells me that Nigel built a bike for her youngest son Chrystian, the two-year-old brother of club rider Chrystiano. “He did this out of his own money,” she says. She shows me a video on her phone of the tiny BMX turned upside down in her living room with her youngest son spinning the wheels with his hand. It makes me think of how kids obsessed with bikes from every generation have taken their bikes apart in living rooms and kitchens.

“Nigel tells me he’s a natural,” she says.

STUDENT PHOTOGRAPHERS CONFRONT SOCIETAL ISSUES

In November, students on the Photojournalism and Documentary Photography MA course at the London College of Communication presented their projects to the public at an exhibition in London.

The Elephants in the Room exhibition saw students address societal issues from around the world, from post-colonialism to mental health, ageing, inequality and migration.

Using photographs, film and text, the students presented a visual exploration of their chosen subject.

Here is a small selection from the students' projects.

 Zoe Savitz

Still Waters, by Zoe Savitz

Zoe Savitz focused on Bulgaria's shrinking population, documenting the lives of people in the Rhodope Mountains, where many villages stand derelict.

"Quietness echoes everywhere you go, a melancholic feeling as you pass through. The sound of flowing water can be heard, a peaceful reminder of this vast and beautiful rural environment.

"Few visitors pass by here. When I wander through, I am welcomed into people's homes, like family."

 Marco Massa

Oltremare, by Marco Massa

Marco Massa's project provided an intimate portrait of his mother's life living with Parkinson's disease.

"Facing the sea, as far as the eyes can reach before they meet the sky, is the Oltremare. With our feet planted on wet sand, it is a shade of blue we can only perceive from a distance, from one angle; not as vibrant as the waters we can walk into, not as boundless as the cerulean above. Only a deep dive, away from the safety of the land, reveals its nature.

"Just like the multiplicity of life and the transformational nature of growing up, people affected by Parkinson's disease experience a variety of symptoms, both psychological and physical, which can translate into a multitude of selves."

 Hiroyuki Taira

Behind the Wall, by Hiroyuki Taira

As the thirtieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall approaches, Hiroyuki Taira's project questioned people's motivation to build walls.

"Why do some countries build walls and fences? They are constructed physically and ideologically for different purposes: separation, defence, and border. Border barriers generally aim at separating conflicting states and keeping out migrants. People seem to think it is a security measure. But walls usually create more problems.

"Through this project, I deliver images to show that people become powerless and sometimes powerful when confronted with walls."

 Tom Warland

The British Heritage Project, by Tom Warland

Tom Warland's ongoing project looks at craftspeople in the UK.

"In an age of reliance on the pre-made and the computer-made, there has been a rise in popularity for artisan crafts. Craftsman across Britain are learning ancient skills and trades, and putting them into practice, working on the knife-edge that is between the security of certainty, and the ruin of weeks of work."

 Adam Onishi

Manscape, by Adam Onishi

Adam Onishi's documentary film and accompanying photographs aimed to reduce the stigma around men's mental health by sharing the stories of six men who are beginning to talk about their issues.

"Whether suffering depression, anxiety, burnout, imposter syndrome or one of many other common mental health problems, men's mental health is a serious condition that can often go unnoticed. To show others that it is possible to talk about these issues, the film looks at the experiences of men dealing with their mental health problems, what helps them get through and how they were able to start to seek help."

 Jesper Houborg

We Are Still Here, by Jesper Houborg

Jesper Houborg's project looked at identity and the post-colonial legacy in everyday life in urban Zimbabwe.

"We Are Still Here is a visual investigation into the collective spirit - zeitgeist - of a young nation highly underreported due to a tightly closed media space."

 Aylin Illel

Ce N'est Pas Moi (It's Not Me), by Aylin Illel

Aylin Illel explored contemporary womanhood in Turkey, through domestic spaces and possessions.

"Turkey has been a secular state during the last century. The changing socio-political climate has intensified its effects on each citizen over the course of the last two decades. The women and their existential struggles have become even more invisible and inconspicuous.

"This work aims to create a feeling about contemporary womanhood focusing on the notion of oppression from patriarchal family and social structure."

 Lily Bungay

Ikaria, by Lily Bungay

The older inhabitants of the Greek island Ikaria are documented in Lily Bungay's project.

"Ikaria is a Greek island unbound by conventional notions of time. Its oldest inhabitants are not segregated, but celebrated. Institutional care homes do not exist and instead every home is individually cared for. The island's traditional way of life has stood the test of time, allowing for prolonged, happy and healthy lives, mostly unmarked by cancer, dementia and heart disease."

The Elephants in the Room exhibition ran from 15 - 18 November 2018 at London College of Communication. The full range of student projects can be viewed on the Elephants in the Room website.

THE REMOTE UK COMMUNITY LIVING OFF-GRID

On a remote peninsula in the north-west Highlands of Scotland is the small off-grid community of Scoraig.

Accessible only by boat or a five-mile walk, the residents of Scoraig live in relative isolation, partly powering their homes and school with wind power. Among the inhabitants are crofters with cattle and sheep, a violin maker, a Russian translator, volunteers and a part-time postal worker.

Earlier this year, photographer Ed Gold lived alongside the community, documenting people's lives and exploring what drove them to move to this remote location.

Lisa, 54

"I have been here 23 years. I don't think it is very remote really in the sense that people think about remoteness - but its inaccessibility, which I think is appealing.

"It's by no means idealistic and it has its own hardships of the wind and the rain.

"You are exposed to the elements - but that's good also as you are aware of what the weather is doing all the time and you're very much in touch with nature and the elements and life.

"We're an ageing population but I guess the bulk of us are between 40 and 65.

"There are not so many people that are younger than us, apart from the kids obviously.

"I am the post-person three days a week, sub-contracted by the Royal Mail.

"I am responsible for everybody's important post and for transporting it across the loch as dryly and as safely as possible.

"I have a sea-taxi business, which runs a regular sea-ferry service, but a lot of people have their own boat and there is also a communal boat."

Hugh, 65

"I came here in 1975. I was brought up in Edinburgh and my background is in maths and physics.

"When I first came to live here, we didn't have electricity in the first few years.

"Wind seemed like an obvious way to make power and was a very exciting way to produce renewable energy.

"I was active earlier than a lot of others with wind power.

"There was a time when if you typed "wind power" into Google, my webpage was on the first page that came up - but those days are long gone.

"Through the internet, I have a large international network of design enthusiasts that follow, like and continue to use my design approach and teaching courses.

 Ed Gold

"I live here because it is very beautiful and I like the off-grid lifestyle.

"It's not about moral superiority - it's more to do with having more control over your own hands-on environment.

"It's attractive to me to grow my own veg and make my own power rather than be part of a big machine."

Luke, 36

"I grew up on the Isle of Wight and didn't leave until I was 17.

"After my apprenticeship, I built aluminium catamarans for offshore wind farms and large blades for wind turbines - but I was after something that was more manageable that was easier to build for myself.

"A friend of mine stumbled across this place.

"He was travelling across Ireland and Scotland and came across Hugh's name and that he was building windmills.

"So that was how I found out about here and it inspired me.

"We also used to come up to Scotland on holiday although we only moved four years ago."

"It was good for us to move up here - no regrets really.

"The biggest downside is the high school being in Ullapool, so the kids will have to go and stay away all week and that will be difficult for us as we are a close family.

"As the children get older we want them to have the independence to build their own dwellings here.

"They might all want to move away and do their own thing - but it is a great stepping stone to have their own land and it's a big achievement from a young age."

Chisa, 28

"If you speak to anybody here, they will all say that they are getting away from the value system that tells you you ought to be this way or that way, to be valued by your peers or whatever it is which doesn't resonate with everybody.

"They are trying to create their own idea of utopia.

"I'm here for more selfish reasons - I don't want to be surrounded by other people's judgements.

"I have now been here for five years. I came here as a couple, with our son, but we have now split up but still both live here.

"Every year, I go back to Russia and leave my son with my ex.

"I love it because I enjoy the ballet I can do there and I prefer the mentality, the toughness and resilience to change.

"Russians have an ability to withstand anything."

Bev, 79

"I was living in rural Northants, a nine-to-five scientist working for an electronics company in a laboratory.

"My wife, Gill, and I came up here for a holiday and we got hooked on the idea of living here.

"For one thing, I'd always wanted to build my own house and Gill liked the idea as there was a good primary school here for our three children.

"It was much more difficult to get here in those days, lots of single track roads and we didn't have reliable motors on our boats and only one telephone box and no mobile phones.

"When we had visitors, they'd write a letter to us and we'd tell them to drive on to the pier in their car and we'd look out for them with our binoculars.

"I got a job as the part time postman when we moved up here and did that for eight years, by which time I had got a reputation as a violin maker so I gave up the post.

"Most people go to a violin school - but I had a young family at the time, so I couldn't afford that.

"I taught myself from books and other makers - I used to go to exhibitions and competitions.

"I won a national violin-making competition in 1986 that gave my career a boost.

"The census records in 1871 say there was over 380 people here, all Gaelic speakers.

"You can just see how many ruins there are around here and each one would have been supporting a large family.

"It was worrying a few years ago when the primary school population went down to two but now it is seven and a lot of babies are in the pipeline too."

Aggie, 65

"The first time I came here, it just felt like home to me. It was November 1975.

"It worried me slightly that we moved here as I cannot swim and I had young children.

"We needed somewhere to live and it wasn't enough to put me off as we had the option to walk in and out as well.

"I like living here because I like to know where everything comes from, to know myself what the situation is with my electricity and what to do when it goes wrong and the same goes for the water too.

"I think we were very lucky to have Hugh come here and do his windmills.

"By now, I guess, solar would have come in if wind hadn't - and we were just relying on Tilley lamps.

"Everybody expects washing machines now here and everybody has one apart from me. I'm the last person washing by hand here."

Natalie, 37

"I've had five visits here now as I'm interested in communities.

"Some sailors I met on Shetland called me a drifter and I quite liked that.

"Somebody wrote a song about me called Natalie the Nomad. It's what I do - I just drift along with what's happening.

"I think it would be easier for my parents if I lived an ordinary life - they struggle and they worry. But I have never met anyone who gives me a hard time.

"People try to get me into the ordinary - it's hard for people to understand that I don't want a job or to pay the price for what comes with it.

"Generally, if you have a job you are part of the monetary system. I do spend money - but it's a choice.

"I mean, when do you ever really have to spend money? You can always say no. What do I really have to do in life, except breathing?"

Dale, 47

"I was fed up with working in an office all day looking at a screen and having to pay to go to a gym to keep fit.

"I was fed up with all the people - it would take me 40 minutes to drive seven miles to get into work.

"We could have moved not so far away but I had been to Scotland a few times and fancied it.

"There is a proper sense of community here, which I think is lacking in other parts of the country.

"Everybody knows everybody and everybody helps each other out.

"It's the environmental thing, where you can live from solar and wind power and you don't need coal and nuclear power.

"And because you know what you are consuming, where your water comes from and your power, you are always going to be environmentally friendly.

"I used to preach about environmental stuff and then go home and put my 48in flat-screen TV on - but here, you can really live it."

WOMEN'S FC BASEL TEAM NOT INVITED TO CLUB ANNIVERSARY GALA

 Catherine Ivill/The men's team were guests at the gala but the players from the women's team were asked to sell tombola tickets

A gala to celebrate FC Basel's 125th anniversary has caused controversy after the women's team was not invited - but asked to work at the event instead.

The Swiss football club's female side were selling tombola tickets to more than a thousand guests while the men's team had a three-course meal.

After finishing their work, the women were given sandwiches to eat in a different room, CNN reported.

A spokesman for the club said the women "agreed to help" as some of the money raised at the gala was going to their team.

 FC BaselFC Basel said that "many employees were helping in different ways at the event"

None of the players from the women's team have publicly commented about the incident. But the story has prompted a reaction on social media with some Twitter users describing it as "outrageous" and "shocking".

Others said the incident proved there is still gender inequality in sport.

FC Basel said the women's team were not invited to be guests at the event as the club "wanted to have as many anniversary party tickets available as possible for the public".

"No departments - except for our first team, the board and the management of the club - were invited for the night," the spokesman said.

"Since it was our 125th anniversary it was clear, that our first team would take a part in it, vicarious for all the previous teams who wrote our history since the founding in 1893.

"There will be another big anniversary event exclusively for all our teams and employees next year."

CLIMATE CHANGE: REPORT WARNS OF GROWING IMPACT ON US LIFE

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world

Unchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life, a US government report warns.

"Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today," the 4th National Climate Assessment says.

The report says climate change is "presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth".

The warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda.

Sounding an alarm

By James Cook, Los Angeles correspondent, BBC News

During a blast of icy weather in Washington this week, Donald Trump tweeted, "whatever happened to global warming?"

Now, without mentioning the president, his own scientists have answered their boss's question in comprehensive detail.

Global warming is here in the United States, they say - now. It is already deadly serious and without urgent, dramatic change, it will be catastrophic.

 EPAThe report warns that the frequency of wildfires could increase if climate change is unchecked

This report is striking for two reasons. First, it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples - overwhelmed dams in South Carolina; failing crops in the parched Great Plains; a rise in insect-borne disease in Florida.

And, secondly, it majors on the economic impact, in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation.

With warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure, falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity, the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life.

The White House said the report - compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments - was inaccurate.

Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was "largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population".

The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity.

What does the report say?

The US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society.

"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states," the report says.

"Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century."

The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events.

But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and "to adapt to the changes that will occur".

What reaction has there been?

Environmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action.

Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, said the report made it clear that climate change was not "some problem in the distant future".

"It's happening right now in every part of the country," she said.

This bar in San Francisco had a climate change message during a summit in the city in September

That view was echoed by Abigail Dillen, president of environmental group Earthjustice.

"While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, his own administration is sounding the alarm," she said.

What does President Trump say about climate change?

In October, President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a "political agenda", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures.

After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels.

At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new "fair" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.

During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was "a hoax". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: "I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference."

How great is the climate threat?

A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could only be stopped if the world made major, and costly, changes.

That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops.

If the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

BREXIT: MAY HEADS TO BRUSSELS ON EVE OF CRUCIAL EU SUMMIT

 EPATheresa May is facing obstacles to her Brexit plan at home and in Europe

Theresa May is heading to Brussels later ahead of a critical EU summit to formally sign off the Brexit deal.

The prime minister will hold talks with top EU officials, before leaders of all 28 countries meet to endorse the agreement on Sunday.

However, Spain has said it will not attend unless a last-minute spat over Gibraltar is sorted out.

Even if the EU approves the deal, Mrs May must still persuade enough MPs to support it which could prove difficult.

Meanwhile the leader of the DUP - which Mrs May relies on for support in Parliament - will reiterate her opposition of the deal at her party conference later, after threatening to look again at the confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives if it gets through Parliament.

What will happen at the summit?

On Saturday, Mrs May will meet with the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and European Council President Donald Tusk for talks.

Then on Sunday, EU leaders will meet for the special Brexit summit. They will be asked to approve two key Brexit documents:

The political declaration, which sets out what the UK and EU's relationship will be like after Brexit - outlining how things like UK-EU trade and security will work

The EU withdrawal agreement: a 585-page, legally-binding document setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU. It covers the UK's £39bn "divorce bill", citizens' rights and the thorny issue of the Northern Ireland "backstop" - to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What's in the political declaration?

BBC News correspondent Kevin Connolly said some member states are "suspicious of the possibility the UK might be attempting some last-minute negotiations" on Saturday.

There is no formal vote on Sunday but the EU expects to proceed after reaching a consensus.

Why is Spain unhappy?

Spain has raised last-minute objections to how the issue of Gibraltar - a British Overseas Territory with 30,000 residents, 96% whom voted to remain in the EU - has been handled in the Brexit talks so far.

It wants the UK to publish a written statement promising that Spain will be directly consulted on questions relating to Gibraltar during its future trade negotiations with the EU.

On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he will not decide whether to attend Sunday's summit until the assurances are provided.

 ReutersMr Sanchez is pro-European and it is not in his nature to scupper EU plans, the BBC's Katya Adler said

Although one country on its own cannot block the withdrawal agreement being approved, there is "no way the EU can rubber stamp a text when an existing member is so strongly opposed", said BBC News' Europe editor Katya Adler.

Gibraltar is believed to be the only outstanding issue ahead of the summit.

France, Denmark and the Netherlands had raised concerns over what the political declaration said about fishing rights in UK waters - but this issue is understood to have been resolved.

What happens after the summit?

If the EU signs off the withdrawal deal, Mrs May will then need to persuade MPs in her own Parliament to back it.

A vote in Parliament is expected to happen in December.

Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the DUP have all said they will vote against the government's deal.

Some of Mrs May's own Conservative MPs - the hardline Brexiteers - are also highly critical of the deal and are unlikely to support it, while other Remainer Tory MPs may also vote against it.

If MPs back the deal, it then has to be ratified by the European Parliament.

Once the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 - which will happen with or without a deal - the details of a long-term trade deal will be worked out during a 21-month transition period until December 2020.

But if the deal is defeated, a number of things could happen - including leaving in March without a deal, a second attempt to get the Brexit deal passed, another referendum or a general election.

What does Theresa May say about the deal?

On Friday, the PM said the UK should not hope for a "better deal" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement.

But she declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be "different".

Meanwhile, the Telegraph said it has seen leaked Cabinet papers which suggest the PM is planning to "reframe the Brexit debate around migration" - by planning restrictions on low-skilled migrants coming to the UK - in a bid to attract the support of hard Brexiteers ahead of the House of Commons vote.

Does the DUP's support matter?

Yes. After the 2017 general election, Mrs May's Conservative Party got 318 seats - four short of the number she needed to rule with a majority government.

The DUP formed a confidence and supply agreement with the Tories, promising that its 10 MPs would vote with the government, and therefore enable it to win key votes in Parliament.

The DUP opposes the Brexit deal because of the "backstop" - the last resort back-up plan to make sure a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland never happens.

It will only come into effect if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal. But the backstop would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.

TRUMP ASKS US COURT FOR REVIEW OF TRANSGENDER MILITARY BAN

 ReutersPeople protest President Trump's announcement of plans to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving

President Trump's administration is asking the US Supreme Court to consider its proposed restrictions on transgender military members.

It is requesting that the top court review lower court rulings blocking a military ban on transgender people.

Federal courts have prevented the military from implementing a policy barring some transgender Americans from service.

The administration wants the court to hear the dispute this term.

The president announced on Twitter in 2017 that the country would no longer "accept or allow" transgender Americans to serve in the military, citing "tremendous medical costs and disruption".

The administration has since limited the policy to transgender individuals with a history of gender dysphoria.

Following legal challenges, judges in federal courts in three jurisdictions - Washington state, California, and Washington, DC - have refused to lift injunctions issued against the president's original ban to allow the updated policy to be enforced.

The US government is appealing those decisions.

On Friday, the Trump administration filed petitions to the Supreme Court asking for its "immediate review" of the constitutional challenges to the ban.

"And absent this Court's prompt intervention, it is unlikely that the military will be able to implement its new policy any time soon," it said.

The petitions ask for the top court to consolidate the cases for decision and consider the dispute during its current term, which ends in June or July 2019.

Between 4,000 and 10,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are believed to be transgender. An Obama administration policy change has allowed them to serve in the US military.

The revised policy under the Trump administration says that transgender individuals with a history of gender dysphoria are barred from military service "except under certain limited circumstances".

The new policy approved by President Trump allows current transgender service members with gender dysphoria to continue serving if they were diagnosed after the Obama administration's policy took effect.

People with gender dysphoria experience distress or discomfort as a result of a disparity between a their biological sex (assigned at birth) and what they feel their gender to be.

According to the American Psychiatric Association, not all transgender individuals suffer from gender dysphoria.

SANDRA PARKS: ANTI-GUN STUDENT, 13, KILLED BY STRAY BULLET

 WDJTSandra Parks, 13, was shot dead in her home in Milwaukee

"We are in a state of chaos. In the city in which I live, I hear and see examples of chaos almost every day. Little children are victims of senseless gun violence..."

Two years ago, 11-year-old Milwaukee schoolgirl Sandra Parks wrote these words in an award-winning essay about the murders in her city.

On Monday night, aged 13, she was shot by a stray bullet fired into her home.

Her frantic family called 911, but Sandra died at the scene.

The girl's mother, Bernice Parks, told police she had gone to bed early while her children watched TV. She woke to the sound of gunshots shortly before 20:00, and found her daughter bleeding on the floor.

"She said, 'Momma, I'm shot. Call the police,'" Ms Parks told TV station WITI. "I looked at her. She didn't cry. She wasn't hollering. She was just so peaceful... She didn't deserve to leave this world like that."

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett described the situation as "insanity", telling reporters: "Tragically, her death was caused by someone who just decided they were going to shoot bullets into her house, and she's dead. A 13-year-old, on Thanksgiving week, on a school night, in her bedroom, and she died."

Mr Barrett speculated that the shooter may have wanted to "settle a score, express anger, try to scare someone", saying on Tuesday: "All we know is that a 13-year-old died last night in her bedroom."

Midwestern paper the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that one suspect, Isaac D. Barnes, has been charged with homicide and a second man, Untrell Oden, faces two counts for allegedly helping to safeguard two guns.

 Milwaukee County JailIsaac Barnes (L) and Untrell Oden have been charged in connection with the shooting

Mr Barnes' ex-girlfriend reportedly flagged his possible involvement to a police officer at the scene. She said he had approached her parked car on a nearby street carrying an assault-style rifle and wearing a mask.

She said he swore at her and told her "you lucky the kids are in the car. I was gonna fan you down."

Police found Mr Barnes in a nearby home, hiding in a closet.

Milwaukee's murder rate has been falling since a spike between 2014 and 2015, but the city still ranks among America's most deadly, FBI figures show.

'She was everything this world is not'

Sandra was a student at Keefe Avenue School, and her essay - which she called "Our Truth" - had won third place in the Milwaukee Public Schools' yearly Martin Luther King Jr. essay contest.

She spoke to Wisconsin Public Radio in January 2017, saying she yearned to "stop all the violence and... negativity that's going on".

"All you hear about is somebody dying and somebody getting shot. People do not just think about whose father or son or granddaughter or grandson was just killed," she said.

Ms Parks told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel her daughter was "everything this world is not".

"My baby was not violent. My baby did not like violence," she said. "Everybody she knew, everybody that came past, she made them happy."

Milwaukee Public Schools said Sandra is the seventh child at a district school to be murdered in 2018.

At a vigil outside her home on Tuesday night, her grieving mother acknowledged that grim toll.

"I understand that there was a lot of kids that passed away recently and I wouldn't say that my baby was better than the rest," she said.

"But God, Jesus, Lord have mercy...

"Lord have mercy knows, she was a star that was trying to get out, but she didn't know how."

Thanksgiving Day violence

In Alabama on Thursday, one person was killed and two injured following a shooting at mall on the evening prior to Black Friday shopping. Police said a fight between two people, believed to be adults, led to an exchange of gunfire.

In Indiana, three people were killed and two injured in a Thursday night shooting at a private home. Police responded to a call at the home around 10:25pm local time. Two men and one woman were killed and two men were injured and are in critical condition.

In Florida, police shot and wounded an unarmed teenage boy while responding to a domestic disturbance call. Authorities say the 15-year-old was shot in the lower torso during a struggle with four police officers. The boy is reported to be in a stable condition.

'I PARTIED ALL NIGHT TO HIDE FROM MY PTSD'

A study suggests that one in six veterans who left the British military after serving in a combat role in Iraq or Afghanistan would probably qualify for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In some, the symptoms only appear years later.

On Remembrance Day in 2015, Phillip Riding, had been out of the military for one month. He went to the Cenotaph as a civilian, with his medals from Afghanistan pinned to a white shirt, and sang God Save the Queen with the crowd.

In the silence afterwards, a bugle sounded The Last Post. And in that moment, suddenly the memories of Afghanistan came flooding back.

"Something inside had snapped. I couldn't breathe, I was panicking standing there in the ceremony with tears rolling down my face," Riding says. "That sound of the bugle reminded me of the moment it was announced every time a comrade was lost."

Friends, killed or injured, flashed in front of his eyes: Bing from artillery, Tres shot in the ankle, Rocco, Plant, Coops, LJ shot in the shoulder, Jordan….

For five years he had been suppressing these thoughts.

"I thought I was fine but all of a sudden I wasn't any more. That door I kept shut, opened completely. This is how PTSD is, it's something that creeps up on you. It just totally destroyed me."

Riding joined the Army in August 2007 at the age of 16, partly to get out of his home town, Barrow-in-Furness, in Cumbria. He'd faced homophobic bullying at school and thought a "macho" role in the infantry would help mask the fact that he was gay.

"I was living with these guys seven days a week, and I started copying how straight men moved. My body language was super-exaggerated to be manly because I was trying to fit to this image of who I wanted to be in my head."

 Phil Riding

He would plaster his bedside with soft porn. "Bikini models were for sure not what I wanted to see first thing in the morning but there we are."

He even put a pretend girlfriend in his will before leaving for his tour of Afghanistan.

In 2010 the British military had the task of curbing opium production in Helmand Province. It was a dangerous job in territory largely controlled by the Taliban.

"Once you've been shot at it never leaves your brain. The bullet that comes near you sounds like a crack of a whip. There were countless operations where I was in a near-death situation, almost blown up in armoured vehicles by improvised devices or ducking shells from our Apache [helicopter]."

Riding wasn't hurt himself, but many were.

"There was a task to go out and do some metal-detecting. We played a game of rock paper scissors to decide who should go on patrol and who should stay behind. I won the game. He went out and was shot in the ankle."

 Phil Riding

One of his roles in Afghanistan was to drive lorries. Once he went on rest and recreation, and the driver who took his place rolled over an IED and ended up having his back reconstructed.

He was lucky, but being lucky made him feel guilty. "Shouldn't it have been me? Shouldn't I have gone on patrol?" he asks.

Coming close to death made Riding think hard about his life, and he decided to come out and live authentically as a gay man. "It was like being born again," he says. "This time I was being who I wanted to be - myself."

Initially his family didn't take the news well. Around Christmas 2011, when Same-Sex Marriage Bill was passing through Parliament, Riding's younger brother asked if he would get married. His grandmother then said she wouldn't attend the wedding if so, and his mother followed suit. "There was an argument, and I wish that I had handled it better," he says. He left home on Boxing Day.

Coming out to people in the army didn't go well either. Some former friends got up and left when he sat down next to them at dinner. Things only improved after he launched a complaint. Now he decorated his bedside exuberantly with rainbow flags and male pin-ups.

 Phillip RidingMarching at Pride in 2015

He also found solace in London's LGBT community, travelling up there at the weekends. The gay nightclub scene in Soho was so different from army life, it was a form of escape.

"It was blessing to talk to people who didn't know anything about the military or what it was like in Afghanistan.

"My friends were incredulous, teasing me: 'Seven months in Afghanistan? Just you and all those soldiers, and nothing happened? Yeah right!'"

Being in the army isn't like it's depicted in the movies. "Not everyone is really handsome, dashing. You're enjoying not thinking about romance. From the moment you wake up, you're working and your mind is on the job."

But the high-octane pace of clubbing also seemed to serve one of his needs after the tour in Afghanistan.

"When you have adrenaline pumped into you every single day for seven months, when you come home that's missing. Time moves slow. People moved slowly. It was so quiet. I needed to be in the clubs to fill that gap.

"Being in a nightclub, it's just so loud, the bass in the floor. There is so much energy everywhere - it's sensory overload."

 Joel Ryder

Riding had his driving licence revoked after being caught speeding twice in two years after he returned from Helmand. "Once I was going 85 mph on a 60 mph dual carriageway with music at full blast. Risky stuff like that because it was an adrenaline rush."

He thinks that the excitement of coming out probably helped to mask his PTSD after Afghanistan. "I didn't think I had an issue. I was dealing with accepting my sexuality and meeting all these new people. For the first time in my life, there were people who I fancied who actually fancied me back!"

When it came to renew his contract with the army in October 2015, he decided against it and took up a job as an events manager for a nightclub. He would go into Soho in the day, arrange the events and be ready to work late into the night, while socialising with friends.

But he found himself asking this question: "I've come out, but why am I still hitting the bottle? Why am I still not wanting to go to sleep?"

And a month later, on Remembrance Day, he received an answer.

Riding likens the feeling of suppressing his PTSD to trying to hold down an inflatable ball in water. "It's different for everybody, but this is what it's like for me. I kept trying to hold down all the things I saw and you can only hold it down for so long. The more you hold it down, the stronger the ball shoots back up, more powerful than before. And that's what happened with me."

He started having nightmares about his time on tour and working all night seemed to help him cope.

"I would have flashbacks. I did what I could to avoid closing my eyes in case I started to see Afghanistan," he says. "I wanted to physically exhaust myself, so that when I eventually got home in the early hours, I could just collapse in bed and I wouldn't dream."

The Last Post had been the first sound to trigger Riding's PTSD, but other everyday sounds now had the same effect - a motorcycle abruptly appearing from nowhere or someone yelling in the street.

What does PTSD feel like?

Flashbacks & nightmares: These can be so realistic that it feels as though you are living through the traumatic experience again and again - ordinary sounds, sights and smells can trigger flashbacks

Avoidance & numbing: You distract yourself by keeping your mind busy with an activity or working very hard, while avoiding places and people that remind you of the trauma - and you may try to become emotionally numb, feeling nothing at all

Being hypervigilant: You stay alert all the time, as though you are looking out for danger - anxiety makes it hard to sleep, and others may notice that you are irritable and cannot relax

There was a trigger in the club as well.

"At midnight they have this balloon drop, balloons fall from the ceiling and they bounce on the crowd. The sound it makes is just like gunfire happening over my head."

The first time he experienced it he was frozen on the spot. "It shocked me that even though my brain was telling me I am literally just seeing balloons fall down, I couldn't move because I was panicking."

It got to the point that Riding would leave quickly when the balloon drop was about to happen and his friends noticed. "No-one understood why, because I didn't tell anyone. They just thought I was weirdo, that 'Phil doesn't like balloons.'"

 Phillip RidingPhillip Riding and Chrissy Darling at Popcorn, Heaven

He felt that working in the club brought some order to his life. "I was in the military for years, having that authority, I got used to it. In a way, being that person that people look to in the nightclub for direction is similar."

But the sense of the club as a safe space was shattered on 12 June 2016, when a gunman opened fire at a gay nightclub - Pulse, in Orlando, Florida - killing 49 people and injuring 53 before being shot dead by police. At the time, it was the deadliest massacre in modern American history.

Statistics on military PTSD

17% of ex-forces whose last deployment was a combat role in Iraq or Afghanistan would probably qualify for a PTSD diagnosis, according to a study published last month by the King's Centre for Military Health Research

PTSD prevalence rates for the military population as a whole have increased from about 4% in 2003-4 to about 6% in 2014-15 - the rate could be as high as 9% in some combat units, researchers from the King's Centre told the Commons Defence Select Committee in March

They added that 50% of the PTSD that arises in the forces is caused by non-operational traumatic incidents such as car accidents or assaults

Riding had actually been to Pulse in 2011. "I know the venue and I knew some of the people who were there that night. I think about them pinned down in the bathroom... and having to witness their friends and family being shot and killed," he says.

"It was horrifying, warfare coming into the community I know and love. Before I felt that I could keep the worlds apart but now they are crashing into each other. The idea that a terrorist attack could happen here too."

It wouldn't be the first time, Riding says, mentioning the 1999 nail-bomb attack carried out by a neo-Nazi at the Admiral Duncan, one of Soho's oldest gay pubs.

He started to be troubled by intrusive thoughts, imagining bad things happening to his family and friends. In Afghanistan he had been bothered by the thought that if he had acted differently, a comrade might not have got hurt. Now this kind of thinking became obsessive and infiltrated his daily life.

When meeting a friend for coffee in Soho, he would imagine a bomb exploding in the gay bar next door and his friend dying in front of him. "The questions cross my mind, 'What if they were just late by 10 minutes? What if I had just gone shopping, and they wouldn't have had to come meet me?'

"It never ends. This guilt is unbearable. Not just the guilt of what has happened but even hypothetical situations. So what can I do?"

It took years for Riding to be formally diagnosed with PTSD and start receiving therapy.

For a long time he tried to avoid seeking help, mistakenly believing that a diagnosis of PTSD on his medical record would harm his prospects when applying for jobs. Other soldiers were under the same illusion, he says.

"It's one of those urban legends. We simply didn't talk about mental health to each other so I didn't know. I wish I had known sooner."

Help for those affected

Nowadays he makes a conscious effort to rethink the noises that trigger his PTSD. At 27, he's made a conscious effort to associate the national anthem with good times. "It always has me in tears," he says. "I want to think instead about all the good times with all the brave lads."

He says that his sleeping is better now and that he's in control of his PTSD - not the other way round. Trying to bury it, he says, was the wrong idea.

"So if my PTSD is that inflatable ball - it's like it's been deflated. It'll still be here but I'm holding it down for now."

VIRGIN ATLANTIC IN TALKS TO RESCUE FLYBE



Flybe and Virgin Atlantic have confirmed they are in talks about a sale or closer alliance.

The move comes after cash-strapped Flybe put itself up for sale earlier this month.

The Exeter-based regional airline said that Virgin was "one of the parties" it has been in discussions with.

Last month, Flybe warned its full-year losses would be £22m, blaming falling consumer demand, a weaker pound and higher fuel costs.

Confirming the talks, Flybe added that there was no certainty that an offer would be made by Virgin.

In a short statement, Virgin Atlantic said it "has a trading and codeshare relationship with Flybe and confirms that it is reviewing its options in respect of Flybe which range from enhanced commercial arrangements to a possible offer for Flybe".

Since hitting a price of nearly 50p in March this year, Flybe's shares have fallen by more than three-quarters. On Friday, they jumped by nearly half to 14.3p.

Heathrow access

Aviation analyst Andrew Charlton, from Aviation Advocacy, said Virgin Atlantic was likely lured to the beleaguered budget carrier to gain access to its take-off and landing slots at Heathrow airport.

"Flybe has a fine suite of slots across the UK, particularly at Heathrow. Any bid by Virgin would be a back-door way to get access to them and is probably cheaper than to wait to buy similar landing slots outright."

Mr Charlton said that Virgin Atlantic may also benefit from certain regional routes flown by Flybe which would deliver passengers into London for Virgin Atlantic's long-haul operations based in London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports.

Flybe, whose roots date back to 1979, has 78 planes operating from smaller airports such as London City, Southampton, Cardiff, Belfast City, Aberdeen and Norwich to destinations in the UK and Europe.

It serves about eight million passengers a year, but has been struggling to recover from an expensive IT overhaul and has been trying to reduce costs.

SAMSUNG APOLOGISES TO SICK FACTORY WORKERS

 ReutersSamsung boss Kim Ki-nam delivered the formal apology

Samsung has formally apologised to employees who fell sick or died after working in its factories.

In the apology, Samsung president Kim Ki-nam said staff and families had "suffered" because the South Korean company had been too slow to act.

Earlier this month Samsung agreed a compensation deal for workers who fell ill while on its production lines.

The apology follows a campaign to win redress for staff by Hwang Sang-ki, the father of one Samsung worker who died.

Cash payout

"Beloved colleagues and families have suffered for a long time, but Samsung Electronics failed to take care of the matter earlier," said Mr Kim, adding that the company had "lacked being considerate".

He said Samsung Electronics had not "fully and completely" handled potential health risks on production lines that make chips and LCD displays.

"Today, we wish to express a sincere apology to the workers who suffered from diseases, as well as their families," Mr Kim said.

Mr Hwang Sang-ki, who headed the compensation campaign, said the apology did not go far enough.

"Honestly, today's apology made by a Samsung Electronics CEO is not sufficient for the victims of the work-related diseases," he told the Yonhap news agency.

However, he said, he would "consider" it as resolution of the issue.

The death of Hwang Yumi prompted her father to lead a compensation campaign

Mr Hwang began the compensation campaign in 2007 after his daughter, Hwang Yumi. died on the way to hospital after developing leukaemia.

He sought to shame the company into making payouts to workers who suffered the same disease or who contracted other illnesses after working for the company.

He set up the Supporters for the Health and Rights of People in the Semiconductor Industry (Sharps) with the help of labour activists. The group held protests and sit-ins to put pressure on Samsung to act.

Sharps said it had found 319 other victims, 117 of whom had died, as of June this year.

The compensation package agreed this month will see sick workers - and their children with related illnesses - get up to 150m won (£103,207) per illness.

All current or former staff who worked for Samsung and its sub-contractors on the chip and display lines in the Giheung factory in South Korea since 1984 can apply for compensation.

The agreement does not acknowledge that Samsung workplaces are directly related to the diseases suffered by some employees.

D&G: CHINA SHOPPING SITES PULL PRODUCTS IN AD BACKLASH



Dolce & Gabbana products have been pulled from Chinese e-commerce sites as the backlash against a controversial ad campaign grows.

The firm posted videos this week showing a Chinese model struggling to eat pasta and pizza with chopsticks.

The campaign was accused of trivialising Chinese culture and promoting unflattering stereotypes.

The controversy risks alienating Dolce & Gabbana from one of the world's biggest luxury markets.

Local celebrities have called for a boycott of the brand.

The brand crisis deepened when messages allegedly written by co-founder Stefano Gabbana, which included offensive comments about Chinese people, went viral.

The firm apologised for any offence but said it and Gabbana's Instagram accounts had been hacked.

It offered a fresh apology on Friday, publishing a video showing Gabbana and co-founder Domenico Dolce appealing for their "misunderstanding of Chinese culture" to be forgiven.

 Dolce and GabbanaDomenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana asked for "forgiveness"

A brand that 'knows China'

The Italian firm cancelled its fashion show in Shanghai earlier this week.

But the backlash has continued as retailers in China retreated from the brand.

On Friday, Dolce & Gabbana products were not available in China on major e-commerce sites Taobao and JD.com, as well as smaller platforms Kaola and Secoo.

Alina Ma, associate director of research at market insights firm Mintel, said the advert had left Chinese consumers confused and appeared to show the company did not understand them.

"They want a brand that knows them, that makes them feel that they are important," Ms Ma said.

It is a crucial market for luxury firms. A 2018 report by consultancy Bain & Company forecast the luxury goods market in mainland China will grow by up to 22% this year.



"Chinese consumers continue to stand out as a growth-driver for the industry," the report said.

While the controversy could hurt their business, the long-term impact will depend on how Dolce & Gabbana deal with the fallout.

"If they can show they sincerely want to know the Chinese consumer, want to know the Chinese market… their business may turn around," Ms Ma said.

Other controversies

It is not the first time Dolce & Gabbana has drawn controversy.

Last April, the brand posted a campaign on Weibo that showed impoverished people in run-down areas of Beijing pictured with Dolce & Gabbana models ahead of a catwalk show in the city.

The pictures were criticised for stereotyping Chinese history by showing old parts of the city, rather than more modern depictions of Beijing.

Dolce & Gabbana also caused controversy in 2016 when it called an item of footwear in its spring/summer collection a "slave sandal".

WHY TECH IS TAKING A HAMMERING

The FAANGs have been savaged over the past week

Technology stocks have had a very bad week. For the FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) which have led the charge in growth over the past decade, it was grim.

At their lowest point, all five were down more than 20 per cent from their peaks. This translates to hundreds of billions of dollars in value being wiped from them.

Apple was the first company to cross the $1trn mark this year. It fell to $840bn by close of play on Tuesday, and hasn't recovered since.

Amazon, which also briefly crossed over the $1trn threshold, dropped to $731bn. That's a quarter of a trillion dollars right there. I know your sympathy for Jeff Bezos may be limited, but these are big numbers. Facebook, meanwhile, is trading at around the value it had early last year - long before the scandals of this year took their toll.

But those scandals may be a distraction from the big pictures. Why are tech stocks taking a hammering, and what does it indicate about the wider macroeconomic picture?

Facebook scandals in 2018 have meant a tough year for Mark Zuckerberg

When considering market fluctuations and, by extension, whether to invest, the key is to look at the fundamentals and over the long-term. Some context here is vital.

Global worries

These companies are still exceptionally rich, staffed by many of the smartest innovators on earth, and good at planning. Moreover, they are registering whopping profits; indeed, record-breaking profits in Amazon's case, and forecast-beating profits for Apple and Facebook.

And given the wider hit to stock markets from weaker global GDP growth, and with a looming potential trade war between America and China, it's inevitable that tech stocks should also be hit.

But a new world is emerging for these companies, in which three fundamental shifts point to a new era that will place limitations on their acceleration. That is not to say they will go into reverse; just that they might slow.

First, monetary policy is tightening around the world. Since the financial crash, we have lived in an extraordinary period of sustained low-interest rates. This has been good for borrowers.

When borrowing is cheap, investors are - relatively speaking - more relaxed about returns. When the cost of borrowing rises, so do investor demands for reliable returns. The shift from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening puts a discipline into the market. Rising interest rates make equities sweat. Tech stocks are feeling the effect.

The second big change, which is well documented, is the threat of national and supranational regulation. A feeling unites legislators from Washington to Brussels, Berlin and Delhi: smarter regulation of these companies is socially necessary and, probably, economically manageable.

Resurgent nationalism in many parts of the world has curtailed the freedom of many global companies, which tech giants almost by definition are. And the example of GDPR in Europe, which aims to shift control of data back to consumers from these companies, is being closely watched. If it is seen to work, it will be widely copied.

Peaking out

The third big change is perhaps less documented, and most alarming for these companies. This is the possibility that they are maxing out on scale.

LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman has been focusing on the idea that the remorseless pursuit of scale is what gives data-based companies their advantage

Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, has co-authored an important new book called Blitzscaling. This riffs on the idea that it is the remorseless pursuit of scale that gives data-based companies their advantage. The first scaler, rather than the first mover, will emerge victorious in various markets. That, according to Hoffman, is why venture capitalists are happy to tolerate the lack of profits at a company like Uber.

If this argument is right, what if companies like Facebook and Apple have already squeezed most of their advantage from blitzscaling their particular markets?

Apple's growth has long been powered by the iPhone - but its popularity with each new version is slowing, as rivals launch brilliant counter-attacks, and markets become saturated.

In the key markets of US, Canada and Europe, Facebook hasn't grown at all in the past quarter. Think about what that does to the mentality of a company used to super-star growth, on its way to 2.6bn global users.

What if, say, 3bn users is where Facebook will peak? That is why, by the way, the company is trying to make Instagram, which it owns and which is still growing fast, sweat, by putting more ads in that arena.

What if a back-lash against the misuse of data means consumers spend more time in the private arena of WhatsApp, where there are fewer ads, and it's much harder for Facebook (which also owns WhatsApp) to sell me a car in WhatsApp than on the Facebook News Feed?

Never had it so good

Of course it is true that the relentless drip, drip, drip of scandals engulfing some of these companies, especially Facebook, will weigh on investors too.

But go back to the bigger picture. For well over a decade, during which workers of the world dealt with a financial crash and just avoided a depression, these technology companies enjoyed astonishing freedom.

They were able - largely through their own ingenuity - to pursue growth remorselessly in a low-interest rate world, where they endured relatively little regulation. New markets and vistas constantly opened up to them, and their tax affairs were tolerated in a world of globalist sentiment.

Now interest rates are going up, regulation is coming, those markets are nearing saturation, rivals are launching better attacks, nationalism is tempering globalism, and tax affairs are under new scrutiny.

Their valuations may yet rise further, and will almost certainly bounce back from this week. But for the tech sector, a new era brings harder times.

GCHQ WARNS ON BLACK FRIDAY CYBER-THREAT

Black Friday could provide "prime pickings" for cyber-crime, warns the security agency

Black Friday sales could be targeted as "prime pickings" for cyber-crime, the UK's cyber-security defence agency has warned shoppers.

The National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ intelligence service, is issuing advice to shoppers of the risk of "malicious" online threats.

It is the first such official cyber-warning in the run-up to the Christmas shopping season.

"It's vital that knowledge is shared," says Ian Levy of the cyber-agency.

The cyber-wing of the GCHQ communications centre says it wants to start a "national cyber-chat" on Black Friday when billions are spent on online shopping.

Speaking in public

It might be known for working in secret, but the agency wants to engage with the public over the seriousness of the threat.

It has been involved in trying to tackle more than 550 significant cyber-incidents in the past 12 months, and has taken down almost 140,000 "phishing" websites used by fraudsters.

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is giving tips for individual consumers to avoid cyber-crime - and for the first time it will be publishing answers to questions from the public on Twitter.

There are warnings for better cyber-security when billions are being spent on online shopping

"Staying safe online doesn't require deep technical knowledge, and we want the whole country to know that the NCSC speaks the same language as them," said Mr Levy, the cyber-defence agency's technical director.

"With so many of the UK shopping online, we want to see these tips shared from classrooms and scout groups to family dinner tables and old people's homes."

The agency's chief executive, Ciaran Martin, recently told a meeting of business leaders of a "serious and sustained" threat, including from "elite hackers" in other countries.

"It is not speculation and it is not scare-mongering," said Mr Martin. "Large-scale criminal cyber-activity is, sadly, ubiquitous."

This could include the "theft of millions" from retailers and attacks on financial networks on which shops depend, he said.

'Post-Christmas headache'

A data breach had an average cost of £3m, he said - and there were estimates that the WannaCry cyber-attack last year had cost the United States £3.5bn.

Another cyber-attack last year, known as NotPetya, had cost one firm up to £250m, including the cost of replacement IT equipment.

The British Retail Consortium is backing the calls for better cyber-security during the Christmas shopping season.

"With more and more shoppers looking to get the best deals online, retailers continue to invest significantly in developing the right tools and expertise to protect against cyber-threats," says James Martin, security adviser to the retailers' organisation.

But he warned of the danger of cyber-crime causing a "post-Christmas headache".

The National Cyber Security Centre's advice to reduce the risk of cyber-crime is:

WHY DO BILLIONS OF PEOPLE STILL LACK BASIC SANITATION?

 WSUPDhaka, Bangladesh: Community leader Nasima shows off her village's new community toilet

Hi-tech loos that use little or no water and can recycle waste products safely and sustainably promise to give billions of people around the world access to much-needed sanitation. So why do so many still lack this basic amenity?

About 2.3 billion people still lack basic toilets, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). And 4.5 billion don't have safely managed sanitation, with waste disposed in a way that won't contaminate drinking water.

Each year contaminated water kills half a million children under five through diarrhoeal diseases, the WHO says.

So many inventors, entrepreneurs and research institutions around the world have been working on hi-tech loos that can function without the need for expensive mains sewerage systems.

 WSUPMillions of people live next to unsanitary open sewers with potentially fatal consequences

One approach is taking chloride from urine, turning it into chlorine with electricity, and using that as a disinfectant, says Dr Brian Hawkins, a research scientist in nanomaterials at Duke University, North Carolina.

Activated charcoal can remove organic material and nano-membranes replace the need for septic tanks, he says.

A solar-powered toilet using this approach, developed at Duke and nearby universities, is being tested at a cotton mill in Coimbatore, India and a township in South Africa.

Currently, it can handle about 15 users a day.

New membrane technology means toilets can "get clean water out of human waste, which is pretty cool", says Dr Alison Parker, a lecturer at Cranfield University in Bedford.

But power is needed to push waste through the membranes. So the challenge is making a self-contained loo that doesn't need external electricity.

 Cranfield UniversityCranfield University's clever loo can produce clean water from human waste

Her lab's Nano Membrane Toilet works by "relying on the energy we can get from human waste, burning faeces, and the person lifting the lid and closing it again - so that's not a huge amount of energy to work with," she says.

But reverse electrodialysis, from putting faeces components on one side of the membrane and urine on the other, "gives us a little extra energy", she says, and is "just enough to give it the boost to do what we need".

Heating urine before it goes through the membrane to be closer to the vapour state makes it more efficient, too, says Dr Parker.

More Technology of Business

She says her lab's waterless flush toilet is "basically ready and could be commercialised straight away".

A challenge now is making them feasible for rural areas - the membranes need cleaning every three months, which is more easily achieved in cities.

Reducing costs

While there is lots of innovation going on, the key challenge is making sanitation affordable, says Jack Sim, World Toilet Day founder.

He remembers growing up in Singapore in the 1950s and 60s and having to use his village's communal outhouse. It was a "very traumatic" experience, he says, involving buckets and lots of green flies.

Moving to public housing with a flushable loo was "like a miracle", he recalls.

 Jack SimWorld Toilet Day founder Jack Sim (r) meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi

He believes people on low incomes need to be convinced to "sacrifice something else and build a toilet first".

But many promising products are now stuck in the "valley of death", says Duke University's Dr Hawkins.

This is the space between developing a successful prototype and "getting to a locked-down product you can scale up, mass produce, and find a market share".

The aim is to get the operating expenses of clean toilets down to five cents (3.8p) per person per day, he says.

And Neil Jeffery, chief executive of Water & Sanitation for the Urban Poor, a non-profit organisation focusing on African and Indian cities, points out that it's "not just about the toilets - it's about how you collect waste safely, transport it, treat it, and how it's then used".

Most African cities only have 10-15% of households connected to mains sewerage, he says, with many urban settlements sharing pit latrines instead.

When these fill up, a lorry needs to take their contents to a treatment plant.

 Crane EngineeringCrane Engineering's waste treatment trucks will be trialled in 2019

But this can be a costly two- or three-hour drive, says Mark Hassman, project manager for the Mobile Septage Treatment System at Crane Engineering in Wisconsin.

He says the amount of waste that trucks actually bring to treatment plants is "less than 5% [of the total] in some cities".

Instead, they dump it in ditches, mix it with rubbish and burn it, or "plop it in a ditch, and if it's rainy season, it goes downstream".

Mr Hassman has been leading a team designing trucks that can process 70-80% of the waste on site. So instead of emptying two pits, "they can now maybe do eight in one drive, and that hopefully reduces the cost and enables people to afford clean pit emptying," he says.

He says the trucks are "fairly close" to producing potable water.

The trucks will have trial runs in Africa in 2019, and his company is "looking to get these units out there" commercially in 2020.

The crucial requirement is to create a market that enables companies to make a profit from loos that are also affordable for poorer households, he says.

 Crane EngineeringSpecial treatment trucks can turn human waste into clean water

Lack of sanitation also has an economic impact.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has been running its Reinvent the Toilet Challenge since 2011, says "more than $200bn (£155bn) is lost due to healthcare costs and decreased income and productivity" as a result of poor sanitation.

This is one of the reasons why Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed $20bn to build 111 million latrines by 2019 - "the biggest toilet building project in the history of mankind", says Mr Sim.

The goal of sanitation for all may still be "some years" away. "But I can see this problem being solved in the next decade," he says.

Not a day too soon for the billions still suffering.

WILL GOMPERTZ REVIEWS THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB STARRING CLAIRE FOY ★★☆☆☆

The omens weren't good.

It was the evening after the heavily advertised nationwide release of The Girl in the Spider's Web: A New Dragon Tattoo Story, and the city centre cinema, where I went to see the film was as empty as a trickster's promise.

Such a pitiful showing would have been a dispiriting sight for the Sony Pictures execs who'd backed the movie to kick-start the stalled Millennium Series franchise. For those who didn't show up, rest easy - you made the right choice.

The fifth film to have been adapted from Stieg Larsson's best-selling Scandi-noir saga is easily the worst of the bunch.

And that's not because it is an adaptation of the fourth book in the series written after Larsson's death by David Lagercrantz (who also ghosted the best sports autobiography in living memory, I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic).

The problem with the film, nominally a psychological thriller, is that it is neither disturbing nor thrilling.

 Sony Pictures ReleasingThe Girl in the Spider's Web is an action-packed film, but lacks dramatic tension

It is a perfectly serviceable but very predictable action movie full of car-chase clichés and video game shoot-outs, powered by a plot that has about as much dramatic tension as a game of garden bowls.

The movie opens with the two young Salander sisters playing chess in their father's draughty and over-the-top eerie cliff-top concrete castle. When they finish the game their sexually abusive dad decides it's his turn to play with them.

Not nice.

Lisbeth hurls herself from a broken balcony into the deep snow below and legs it. Camilla stays.

 Sony Pictures ReleasingSylvia Hoeks plays Camilla, who is Lisbeth's sister

Cut to a couple of decades later and Lisbeth (Claire Foy) has moved into an industrial space in town that makes her dad's old place look cosy. Still, it matches her goth-punk aesthetic and cold-as-ice persona, which, in turn, fits with her life as a monosyllabic vigilante intent on dishing out the old electric cattle-prod treatment to an assortment of baddies.

 Sony Pictures ReleasingFrom The Queen to punk computer hacker, Claire Foy takes on the role of Lisbeth Salander

She takes on a detective job for a nerdy computer programmer (Stephen Merchant) who has created a nuclear version of Frankenstein's Monster.

"What am I looking for?" she asks.

"The sum of all my sins," replies the bearded Merchant.

It's not a great line in any circumstance, but is beyond limp coming from the mouth of a man who looks like his idea of being naughty is un-tucking his pyjama top.

Anyway, off Lisbeth goes, riding her black Ducatti motorbike with elbows out like wings, into a murky world of deadly Russians, decent Americans, and inscrutable Swedes. She is not entirely alone, as ever she can rely on a little help from a few geeky friends and her old chum and admirer Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason) an investigative journalist.

 Sony Pictures ReleasingInvestigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason) is Lisbeth's ally

And that's it really.

The story unfolds as you would imagine with plot twists as surprising as getting a woolly jumper for Christmas.

Claire Foy does a reasonable job in a limited role, which offers precious little opportunity to flesh out her character beyond being a cartoonishly two-dimensional action hero blessed with the tech skills to put her in the running for Employee of the Month at PC World.

Who knows why the film's talented director Fede Álvarez (Don't Breath) has chosen to swap mind games for endless punch-ups and shots of laptop screens.

 Sony Pictures ReleasingDirector Fede Alvarez fails to capture the psychological depth of Larsson's work

It misses the point of Larsson's creation.

What makes the books so compelling, and the original film in which Noomi Rapace played Lisbeth, is the inner psychological drama that determines and informs each protagonist's actions and relationships.

 The Ronald Grant ArchiveNoomi Rapace won critical acclaim for her portrayal of Lisbeth in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but said she was "done" with playing the part

They are complicated, dark stories, populated by damaged and complex characters. They need time to evolve and unfold in their otherworldliness. The Girl in the Spider's Web doesn't allow for any of that. Instead we have yet another car chase to crack on with and an electric cattle prod to wield.

Why have dark and complicated when you can have simple and light?

The Girl in the Spider's Web still has her dragon tattoo but she's lost her soul.

NOVASAR: UK RADAR SATELLITE RETURNS FIRST IMAGES

 SSTLSydney Harbour: The famous bridge and opera house captured at night

Sydney Harbour and the Egyptian pyramids feature in the debut images from the first all-UK radar spacecraft.

NovaSAR was developed jointly by Surrey Satellite Technology Limited of Guildford and Airbus in Portsmouth, and launched to orbit in September.

Its pictures are now being assessed for use in diverse applications, including crop analysis, flood and forestry mapping, and maritime surveillance.

The intention ultimately is to fly a constellation of NovaSAR-like sats.

Such a network would enable repeat images of locations to be acquired more quickly - something that is important if changes detected in a scene require a rapid response. Reacting to an oil spill at sea would be a good example.

 AIRBUS DSNovaSAR has something of the look of a cheese-grater

Satellite radar's great advantage is that it sees the Earth's surface in all weathers and at night. Many other types of Earth observation (EO) spacecraft need daylight and cloud-free skies to gather their data.

The picture of Sydney Harbour, with its famous bridge and opera house, illustrates this point: it was taken after dark.

The image is resolving objects that are six metres across and larger.

"What interests me most in this picture are the boats," said Luis Gomes, the chief technology officer at SSTL.

"NovaSAR is seeing not only large vessels but also much smaller pleasure craft. We can't see the shape of them, but we can certainly see that they are there. And that's encouraging because one of the main objectives of NovSAR will be maritime surveillance," he told BBC News.

The satellite is equipped with a receiver that can pick up Automatic Identification System (AIS) radio signals.

These are the positional transmissions that large ships are obliged to broadcast under international law.

Vessels that tamper with or disable these messages very often are engaged in smuggling or illegal fishing activity.

If such ships appear in NovaSAR's radar pictures, they will be reported to the authorities.

 SSTLCairo: The radar picks up a range of different terrains

The Cairo scene, featuring the Great Pyramids, showcases the satellite's ability to discern different land uses.

The picture includes buildings, cultivated fields, trees, and desert/rock.

Martin Cohen, a radar expert with Airbus, commented: "The first image from orbit is always a key moment for everyone involved in such a mission, and this is no exception. The quality of the imagery is a credit to the hard work and dedication of the whole team here in Portsmouth.

"We look forward now to supporting SSTL through the rest of the commissioning phase, and seeing the mission begin full operational use."

There are a range of partners involved in assessing NovaSAR's capabilities. These include EO specialists in India and Australia. The UK's Ministry of Defence also wants to see what the spacecraft can offer Britain's armed forces.

UK engineers have long worked in space radar but their technology has previously always gone on broader missions, such as those for the European Space Agency. NovaSAR, in contrast, is solely a British initiative.

The UK government has invested £21m in the project. Science Minister Sam Gyimah said: "Yet again we can see UK research and innovation that is truly out of this world," he said.

"This 'eye in the sky' can capture an image a dozen times wider than the Strait of Dover and the data it provides can help crack problems from illegal shipping to alerting us to damaging pollution that needs to be countered."

AIRBNB SUED FOR PULLING WEST BANK SETTLEMENTS

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gidi hosts a property located in the West Bank and is disappointed at Airbnb's decision

Holiday homes rental giant Airbnb is being sued in a class action by a law firm in Jerusalem over its delisting of settlements in the occupied West Bank.

It accuses Airbnb of "grave and outrageous" discrimination for not applying the same standard in occupied areas in other parts of the world.

On Monday, Airbnb said it took the move because it viewed settlements as "core" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The step was hailed by Palestinians and denounced by Israel.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Maanit Rabinovich from the settlement of Kida, and, according to court papers, will seek compensation for other similarly affected holiday home-letters.

It accuses Airbnb of discriminating against Israelis because it continues to list holiday homes in places considered occupied in other geopolitical hotspots, such as Tibet and Northern Cyprus.

Airbnb says it is "evaluating" what to do about lettings in occupied territories in general.

Israel's tourism minister has denounced the firm's action against Jewish settlements as "shameful", and said Israeli authorities would back legal challenges against it.

The move, which affects 200 listings, has been widely praised by Palestinians and their supporters.

Jewish settlements in territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.

 ReutersKiryat Arba (above) is one of about 140 settlements in the occupied West Bank

The issue of settlements is one of the most contentious areas of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.

More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war.

The Palestinians see them as a major obstacle to peace and a barrier to a hoped-for Palestinian state on land which they occupy.

Israel says such an argument is a pretext for avoiding direct peace talks, and that the fate of settlements should be negotiated in accordance with peace accords signed with the Palestinians in 1993.

GOOGLE FINALLY CLEANS UP ITS ESTA ADS AFTER EIGHT YEARS

 USAEstaServiceGoogle removed an ad for this official-looking website

Google says it will stop ads for expensive unofficial Esta services appearing at the top of search results, eight years after the first complaints.

In 2010, the US started charging UK travellers to use the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (Esta).

Unofficial sites charging five times as much as the US government soon flooded the top of Google's search results, despite breaking Google's ad rules.

Now, after a BBC News investigation, Google says it is tackling the issue.

While unofficial Esta sites will still appear in the search results, they should no longer appear above the official website as advertisements when using the most common search terms.

Since it has used machine learning to address the issue, the ads do still show up for some search terms. Google says this will improve in time.

Why has this taken so long?

The official Esta website is run by the US Department for Homeland Security. It charges $14 (£10.70) for each Esta application.

But countless unofficial sites appeared at the top of Google search results by buying advertisements.

These unofficial sites charged more than $80 for an Esta application.

Google's advertising policies explicitly forbid "charging for products or services where the primary offering is available from a government or public source for free or at a lower price".

The company did take down ads that were manually reported by its users, but the same websites would soon reappear with a new web address.

It was a fruitless game of "whack a mole".

What has changed?

The BBC sent several unofficial Esta ads to Google and asked why they had been allowed to remain on the platform. One of the websites advertised on Google was charging $99 (£76) per Esta.

Google took the ads down, but others immediately filled the space.

 Bintech Advisers SLAn ad for this Esta site was also taken down

After the BBC supplied more of the unofficial Esta ads, Google said it would look into the problem. It later said it had been able to develop its machine learning process to wipe out the unofficial Esta ads.

Following the change, commonly used Esta search terms no longer carry ads for the unofficial services.

Some less common searches may still return ads while the algorithm continues to learn, but the most obvious ones such as "esta" should no longer show ads, it said.

Beyond Estas

Other countries including Australia and Canada also have travel permits similar to the Esta.

Just like the Esta, there are countless unofficial websites offering Australia ETA and Canadian ETA permits at inflated prices.

Ads for these services have also been prominent on Google. But the search giant said it would use the same machine learning systems to eliminate these too.

In a statement, Google said: "We know that people look to Google ads for information about where to get goods and services, so we are committed to ensuring that the ads they see are useful and relevant.

"We use a combination of algorithmic and human review to catch and remove bad ads; and we continue to update our policies and methods of enforcement."

It said it encouraged people to report ads that slipped through the system, so they could be manually reviewed.

'I HIRE A MAN TO PRETEND TO BE MY DAUGHTER’S DAD - AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW'

Megumi was a baby when her parents separated and her father disappeared from her life. But years later her mother told her he wanted to reconnect. Megumi began to see Yamada regularly. She thinks he is her father, and that Yamada is his real name - but this is a lie.

"Ever since she was little she'd ask me where he was," says Megumi's mother, Asako. "All she knew was that he had gone soon after she was born, so she blamed herself."

For years it didn't appear to be a problem. But when Megumi was about 10, Asako noticed a change in her daughter's behaviour.

"She didn't talk to me and became very quiet and withdrawn," Asako says.

"It took a long while to find out about the bullying."

Asako discovered that Megumi wasn't only blaming herself for her parents' breakup. Her classmates were also ostracising her because she didn't have a dad - children of single parents are often stigmatised in Japan.

Eventually she became so unhappy that she refused to go to school.

"She's my only child and it was breaking my heart to see her so sad," Asako says.

She tried to get the teachers at school to help, but when that failed another idea came into her head.

"All I could think about was, what if I found a man who was nice and kind, an ideal father, someone who would make her feel better?" Asako says.

She'd heard about relative rental agencies that could send an actor to play a guest at a wedding or go on a date - they are well established in Japan. So she contacted one to ask if they could also provide a fake dad. After auditioning five hopefuls, she settled on a man called Mr Takashi.

"I found him the easiest to talk to," Asako says. "He's very kind and sweet, so I just followed my instincts."

Takashi runs a rental agency with about 20 staff and more than 1,000 freelancers - men and women of different ages and backgrounds who can cater for almost any situation, taking on fake names, personalities and roles. They often have to lie, but they are very strict about not breaking the law.

As an actor himself, he's played boyfriends, businessmen, friends and fathers, and been a bridegroom at five fake weddings.

He prepares for his roles, he confesses, by watching Hollywood movies like Little Miss Sunshine, the Oscar-winning film about a dysfunctional family bonding on a road trip, and The Descendants, in which George Clooney plays an indifferent parent who suddenly has to embrace fatherhood after a family tragedy.

"I study these films, and memorise phrases and lines," Takashi says. "I take notes on how different family members interact and communicate, and what it takes to be a certain kind of father or husband. They help me understand different family dynamics and relationships."

Asako met Takashi several times to talk about the kind of father she wanted him to play to Megumi.

"My requests were very simple," she says. "Firstly, I wanted him to say how sorry he was that he couldn't be in Megumi's life until then. Secondly, I wanted him to listen to whatever she wanted to tell him."

Asako then told Megumi that her father had remarried and now had a new family, but that he had recently been back in touch because he wanted to see them again.

He was working, she said, as "an actor".

Megumi was shocked, but eventually agreed to meet him. And so, nearly 10 years ago, Takashi became Yamada, Megumi's father - his longest-running, and perhaps most ethically dubious role to date.

Takashi still remembers their first meeting.

"It was a very complex emotion that was there," he says. "She asked me why I hadn't come to see her before, and I felt her resentment."

As Yamada, Takashi began seeing Megumi and her mother a couple of times a month - joining them on days out, trips to the cinema and visiting for birthdays. And Asako says it didn't take long to see a real change in her daughter.

"After a while Megumi became much happier and more outgoing," she says. "She loved to talk, she was lively - she even wanted to go back to school, and that's when I thought, 'This has all been worth it!'"

One particular occasion sticks in Asako's mind - when she and Yamada were at Megumi's school parents' day.

"We were standing at the back of the classroom," Asako says. "She saw us together and kept on turning around to look at us. She had the biggest smile on her face and that made me really happy."

Takashi's services are not cheap. Each time Asako hires him to play Yamada she pays about 10,000 Yen, (about £70 or $90), and although she earns a decent salary she has to make savings elsewhere to afford it. But when she remembers how unhappy her daughter once was, she thinks it is money well spent.

Takashi also sees a difference in Megumi, from the quiet, hesitant girl that he first met.

"Gradually she became happier and more confident," he says. "I used to meet her with Asako, the three of us together, but one day she said, 'I want to go out with my father, just the two of us,' so I took her out and she held my hand for the first time."

Over the last 10 years, Takashi's character Yamada has grown very close to Megumi, now a young adult. He's become a part of the family. He even tells Megumi that he loves her, in the way that any father might - but, of course, he doesn't really.

How does he justify this act of deception?

"Switching personalities and identities is very important in this job," he says. "But I'm human, and so, of course, it would be a lie if I said I don't feel any emotional conflict saying, 'I love you,' to that child. But this is a business, I have to do it, and I have to keep reminding myself of that."

Asako also understands that some might disagree with her choices.

"I know what I'm doing is drastic," she says. "But I really, really wanted to save my daughter."

To complicate matters, she has also become very attached to the fictional character she is paying Takashi to portray.

"When the three of us are together, I feel at peace," she says.

"We talk, we laugh and we are very kind to each other. He's been in our lives for such a long time now, I would like to marry him and become a real family."

But Asako has had to face the bittersweet reality that she is in love with someone who isn't real and who cannot love her back.

"I have told him [how I feel], but he told me to my face that he's with us because it's his job. It's very complicated," she says.

"I'm very aware that he's only with us because we're paying him.

"I sort of fantasise about our relationship, that maybe we can be a real family, but the relationship as it is actually helps me emotionally and mentally as well. It keeps me stable."

In fact, Asako has no plans to end the arrangement with Takashi and says she would like to carry on hiring him to play Megumi's dad indefinitely - even if that means sinking deeper and deeper into a world of fantasy and deception.

"The ideal situation is that she continues to think of him as her father," she says. "So when she gets married I'd like him to be at her wedding ceremony, and when she has her own child, I'd like him to act as a grandfather as well. The worst case scenario is that my daughter finds out."

And if Megumi's real father were to ever turn up?

That's not a possibility that Asako has ever really considered. As she hasn't had any contact with him since their divorce she feels it is unlikely - but if he did walk through the door one day, she thinks Megumi would choose Yamada over her real dad, because they have such a good "father-daughter" relationship. He is the ideal father, just as Asako hoped he would be.

Takashi is also aware that the lie could continue to grow.

"This is one of the big issues of renting a family," he says. "Megumi could get married in the future and then her husband would think I'm her father. If she then has her own child that means she'd believe I'm the grandfather of her child, and the stakes get bigger and bigger."

And he has thought about how Megumi might feel if she finds out - though the plotlines he envisages might strike many as highly optimistic.

"In the best case scenario, I'd like to think that she might thank me for taking care of her - that is 80% of my imagination," he says.

"The other 20% thinks that she would be devastated. She might say, 'Why did you come clean? Why couldn't you just keep lying to me until the end?'

"I think I've been a big support in her life... Maybe asking her to thank me is a bit excessive, but at least I'd like her to recognise our service."

Many might also find it hard to understand why Asako has chosen to do something which could be so distressing for her daughter, if she discovers the truth. Yet she stands by her decision.

"I know some people think it's foolish to pay money to lie to my own daughter and to have a pretend father, but I was desperate," she says.

"Anyone can understand that horrible feeling of desperation, to see your child so hurt."

She says she does worry about the potential impact on Megumi, but tries not to think about it.

And she thinks this kind of thing happens more than you might imagine.

"My situation isn't unique. I'm sure there are loads more surrogate fathers and mothers out there."

All names have been changed to prevent Megumi uncovering the deception before her mother is ready to tell her

KEANU REEVES HAS A ROLE IN TOY STORY 4



Tim Allen has revealed Keanu Reeves has a part in the Toy Story 4 movie.

Speaking to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, Allen, who voices Buzz Lightyear in the movie franchise, hinted Reeves has a part similar to his own.

"Keanu Reeves has got a great part. Even he said, gentle wonderful guy that he is, 'this sounds too much like Buzz Lightyear' and his character does have an edge to that."

Allen said the fourth instalment was "deep and moving".

But he did not reveal any more details about Reeves' character, other than to say it is smaller than Buzz Lightyear.

Last week the first trailer for Toy Story 4 was released which revealed a new character Forky, a spork which has been turned into a toy as a craft project.

Forky is voiced by comedian Tony Hale, who has appeared in hit comedies Arrested Development and Veep.

 DisneyThe teaser trailer revealed Forky is in denial about being a toy

The film is directed by Josh Cooley and sees the toys end up on a road trip alongside old and new friends.

Allen said the film's last scene was very emotional.

"Hanks said it best - of course, he always says stuff best - but the last scene of that movie, I couldn't even get through it. and I thought there were pages after it.

"I read it and I had to turn around from looking at it in the studio, it was so emotional."

He compared it with the classic final scene of Gone With the Wind.

"It's a 'Scarlett, I don't give a damn moment'," he said.

Toy Story 4 is scheduled to be released in the UK on 21 June 2019.

ARE FRENCH RIOTS A CURSE OR A BLESSING FOR MACRON?



Ever since his election campaign, Emmanuel Macron has been keen to prove he's not afraid of French protesters. Where previous governments have blinked, Mr Macron has stared down the unions, weathered their protests, and pushed through difficult reforms on labour laws, and railway workers' pension rights.

But protests over fuel prices this month are presenting him with a new kind of political challenge. This is a protest with no official leader, no national organisation, not run by any union or political party; a protest that feels distinctly spontaneous, individual and diverse. And that diversity is key - both to its importance, and to its potential weakness.

Last weekend, more than 280,000 people dressed in high-visibility jackets blocked roads across France in protest at rising taxes on diesel and petrol, which the government says are to fund eco-friendly projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A small number of hard-core protesters have continued blocking roads and petrol stations this week, and calls have gone out on social media for a second national demonstration this weekend - urging protesters to converge on the capital. So who are the men and women in the hi-vis vests?

"It's the France of the majority, who work, who are not marginalised, who struggle to make ends meet and often end the month in the red, "explains political author Jérôme Sainte-Marie, who has written a book on democratic changes in France.

That majority of struggling families and workers, many of them from France's rural areas or the run-down suburbs that ring its major cities, crosses political party lines, he says, which makes this protest quite unlike the predictable, highly choreographed marches of France's unions or political groups.

President Macron's popularity is slumping, according to some polls

"It's a movement that goes beyond political differences and that's dangerous for Emmanuel Macron," Saint-Marie explains. "As long as the opposition to Macron is split between left and right, his power isn't challenged. The gilets jaunes (yellow vests) are a kind of social reunification of the opposition that goes beyond political divisions."

Michel Pigenet, a social historian at the Pantheon-Sorbonne University in Paris, agrees. "Anti-tax movements are generally a right-wing cause, but the cost of living is a left-wing issue. There's clearly a will - like Macron himself - to generate a movement that is neither left nor right," he says.

He believes that the gilets jaunes, with their unstructured approach, are a new kind of movement for France, not seen since before the Revolution in 1789, and says the movement "poses a serious political question".

There's lively debate here about the true nature of the protests - whether the movement is being steered by hard-right agitators, or hijacked by political interests. But for every one out blocking roads, there seem to be many French citizens supporting them at home. A survey by the polling agency Elabe found that almost three-quarters of French voters approved of the protests, and that more than half of those who voted for Mr Macron support them.

Several of the main opposition parties have publicly backed them, including the centre right Republicains, the far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon and his far-right rival Marine Le Pen.

"We don't want anyone using our movement, and we don't want leaders," said Frank Buhler, a prominent member of the gilets jaunes. "We have to start all over again, that's how far we've come. The French Revolution started with flour wars; for us it's fuel taxes."

The protests have spread throughout France

Most people agree this is about much more than fuel taxes. It's about the economic policies of President Emmanuel Macron in the face of growing frustration from low- and middle-income workers about making ends meet.

Mr Macron has presented himself as a president brought to power on the back of a grassroots movement, who could heal the rift between voters and leaders, and rebuild trust in democracy among those who felt disillusioned and detached from politics.

Since then, his campaign - like his leadership - has been criticised for being too rigid, too hierarchical, too arrogant and aloof. Now, with has approval ratings falling steeply, he's faced with a real grassroots movement, what will his response be?

The government has put forward a package of 500 million euros to support poorer households in meeting their energy costs. And last week, Prime Minister Eduoard Philippe told a radio programme that he understood the protesters' anger, and defended their right to mobilise. But, he said, the fuel taxes and other economic policies would stay.

Perhaps the government is right not to seem panicked. The surprise success of the gilets jaunes last weekend was based on a spontaneity that's hard to sustain; the French daily newspaper, Le Figaro, has already begun profiling its emerging leaders.

And the diversity that until now has proved such an effective unifier of opposition to the president, may ultimately prove to be its undoing.

"There is general agreement right now, but none of us believe the same thing," says protester Frank Buhler. "We all sing the Marseillaise and call for Macron's resignation - those are the two slogans of the movement. When Macron stands down, we will no longer agree, but right now we walk hand-in-hand. The politics will come later."

STUDENT PHOTOGRAPHERS CONFRONT SOCIETAL ISSUES

In November, students on the Photojournalism and Documentary Photography MA course at the London College of Communication presented their projects to the public at an exhibition in London.

The Elephants in the Room exhibition saw students address societal issues from around the world, from post-colonialism to mental health, ageing, inequality and migration.

Using photographs, film and text, the students presented a visual exploration of their chosen subject.

Here is a small selection from the students' projects.

 Zoe Savitz

Still Waters, by Zoe Savitz

Zoe Savitz focused on Bulgaria's shrinking population, documenting the lives of people in the Rhodope Mountains, where many villages stand derelict.

"Quietness echoes everywhere you go, a melancholic feeling as you pass through. The sound of flowing water can be heard, a peaceful reminder of this vast and beautiful rural environment.

"Few visitors pass by here. When I wander through, I am welcomed into people's homes, like family."

 Marco Massa

Oltremare, by Marco Massa

Marco Massa's project provided an intimate portrait of his mother's life living with Parkinson's disease.

"Facing the sea, as far as the eyes can reach before they meet the sky, is the Oltremare. With our feet planted on wet sand, it is a shade of blue we can only perceive from a distance, from one angle; not as vibrant as the waters we can walk into, not as boundless as the cerulean above. Only a deep dive, away from the safety of the land, reveals its nature.

"Just like the multiplicity of life and the transformational nature of growing up, people affected by Parkinson's disease experience a variety of symptoms, both psychological and physical, which can translate into a multitude of selves."

 Hiroyuki Taira

Behind the Wall, by Hiroyuki Taira

As the thirtieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall approaches, Hiroyuki Taira's project questioned people's motivation to build walls.

"Why do some countries build walls and fences? They are constructed physically and ideologically for different purposes: separation, defence, and border. Border barriers generally aim at separating conflicting states and keeping out migrants. People seem to think it is a security measure. But walls usually create more problems.

"Through this project, I deliver images to show that people become powerless and sometimes powerful when confronted with walls."

 Tom Warland

The British Heritage Project, by Tom Warland

Tom Warland's ongoing project looks at craftspeople in the UK.

"In an age of reliance on the pre-made and the computer-made, there has been a rise in popularity for artisan crafts. Craftsman across Britain are learning ancient skills and trades, and putting them into practice, working on the knife-edge that is between the security of certainty, and the ruin of weeks of work."

 Adam Onishi

Manscape, by Adam Onishi

Adam Onishi's documentary film and accompanying photographs aimed to reduce the stigma around men's mental health by sharing the stories of six men who are beginning to talk about their issues.

"Whether suffering depression, anxiety, burnout, imposter syndrome or one of many other common mental health problems, men's mental health is a serious condition that can often go unnoticed. To show others that it is possible to talk about these issues, the film looks at the experiences of men dealing with their mental health problems, what helps them get through and how they were able to start to seek help."

 Jesper Houborg

We Are Still Here, by Jesper Houborg

Jesper Houborg's project looked at identity and the post-colonial legacy in everyday life in urban Zimbabwe.

"We Are Still Here is a visual investigation into the collective spirit - zeitgeist - of a young nation highly underreported due to a tightly closed media space."

 Aylin Illel

Ce N'est Pas Moi (It's Not Me), by Aylin Illel

Aylin Illel explored contemporary womanhood in Turkey, through domestic spaces and possessions.

"Turkey has been a secular state during the last century. The changing socio-political climate has intensified its effects on each citizen over the course of the last two decades. The women and their existential struggles have become even more invisible and inconspicuous.

"This work aims to create a feeling about contemporary womanhood focusing on the notion of oppression from patriarchal family and social structure."

 Lily Bungay

Ikaria, by Lily Bungay

The older inhabitants of the Greek island Ikaria are documented in Lily Bungay's project.

"Ikaria is a Greek island unbound by conventional notions of time. Its oldest inhabitants are not segregated, but celebrated. Institutional care homes do not exist and instead every home is individually cared for. The island's traditional way of life has stood the test of time, allowing for prolonged, happy and healthy lives, mostly unmarked by cancer, dementia and heart disease."

The Elephants in the Room exhibition ran from 15 - 18 November 2018 at London College of Communication. The full range of student projects can be viewed on the Elephants in the Room website.

THE REMOTE UK COMMUNITY LIVING OFF-GRID

On a remote peninsula in the north-west Highlands of Scotland is the small off-grid community of Scoraig.

Accessible only by boat or a five-mile walk, the residents of Scoraig live in relative isolation, partly powering their homes and school with wind power. Among the inhabitants are crofters with cattle and sheep, a violin maker, a Russian translator, volunteers and a part-time postal worker.

Earlier this year, photographer Ed Gold lived alongside the community, documenting people's lives and exploring what drove them to move to this remote location.

Lisa, 54

"I have been here 23 years. I don't think it is very remote really in the sense that people think about remoteness - but its inaccessibility, which I think is appealing.

"It's by no means idealistic and it has its own hardships of the wind and the rain.

"You are exposed to the elements - but that's good also as you are aware of what the weather is doing all the time and you're very much in touch with nature and the elements and life.

"We're an ageing population but I guess the bulk of us are between 40 and 65.

"There are not so many people that are younger than us, apart from the kids obviously.

"I am the post-person three days a week, sub-contracted by the Royal Mail.

"I am responsible for everybody's important post and for transporting it across the loch as dryly and as safely as possible.

"I have a sea-taxi business, which runs a regular sea-ferry service, but a lot of people have their own boat and there is also a communal boat."

Hugh, 65

"I came here in 1975. I was brought up in Edinburgh and my background is in maths and physics.

"When I first came to live here, we didn't have electricity in the first few years.

"Wind seemed like an obvious way to make power and was a very exciting way to produce renewable energy.

"I was active earlier than a lot of others with wind power.

"There was a time when if you typed "wind power" into Google, my webpage was on the first page that came up - but those days are long gone.

"Through the internet, I have a large international network of design enthusiasts that follow, like and continue to use my design approach and teaching courses.

 Ed Gold

"I live here because it is very beautiful and I like the off-grid lifestyle.

"It's not about moral superiority - it's more to do with having more control over your own hands-on environment.

"It's attractive to me to grow my own veg and make my own power rather than be part of a big machine."

Luke, 36

"I grew up on the Isle of Wight and didn't leave until I was 17.

"After my apprenticeship, I built aluminium catamarans for offshore wind farms and large blades for wind turbines - but I was after something that was more manageable that was easier to build for myself.

"A friend of mine stumbled across this place.

"He was travelling across Ireland and Scotland and came across Hugh's name and that he was building windmills.

"So that was how I found out about here and it inspired me.

"We also used to come up to Scotland on holiday although we only moved four years ago."

"It was good for us to move up here - no regrets really.

"The biggest downside is the high school being in Ullapool, so the kids will have to go and stay away all week and that will be difficult for us as we are a close family.

"As the children get older we want them to have the independence to build their own dwellings here.

"They might all want to move away and do their own thing - but it is a great stepping stone to have their own land and it's a big achievement from a young age."

Chisa, 28

"If you speak to anybody here, they will all say that they are getting away from the value system that tells you you ought to be this way or that way, to be valued by your peers or whatever it is which doesn't resonate with everybody.

"They are trying to create their own idea of utopia.

"I'm here for more selfish reasons - I don't want to be surrounded by other people's judgements.

"I have now been here for five years. I came here as a couple, with our son, but we have now split up but still both live here.

"Every year, I go back to Russia and leave my son with my ex.

"I love it because I enjoy the ballet I can do there and I prefer the mentality, the toughness and resilience to change.

"Russians have an ability to withstand anything."

Bev, 79

"I was living in rural Northants, a nine-to-five scientist working for an electronics company in a laboratory.

"My wife, Gill, and I came up here for a holiday and we got hooked on the idea of living here.

"For one thing, I'd always wanted to build my own house and Gill liked the idea as there was a good primary school here for our three children.

"It was much more difficult to get here in those days, lots of single track roads and we didn't have reliable motors on our boats and only one telephone box and no mobile phones.

"When we had visitors, they'd write a letter to us and we'd tell them to drive on to the pier in their car and we'd look out for them with our binoculars.

"I got a job as the part time postman when we moved up here and did that for eight years, by which time I had got a reputation as a violin maker so I gave up the post.

"Most people go to a violin school - but I had a young family at the time, so I couldn't afford that.

"I taught myself from books and other makers - I used to go to exhibitions and competitions.

"I won a national violin-making competition in 1986 that gave my career a boost.

"The census records in 1871 say there was over 380 people here, all Gaelic speakers.

"You can just see how many ruins there are around here and each one would have been supporting a large family.

"It was worrying a few years ago when the primary school population went down to two but now it is seven and a lot of babies are in the pipeline too."

Aggie, 65

"The first time I came here, it just felt like home to me. It was November 1975.

"It worried me slightly that we moved here as I cannot swim and I had young children.

"We needed somewhere to live and it wasn't enough to put me off as we had the option to walk in and out as well.

"I like living here because I like to know where everything comes from, to know myself what the situation is with my electricity and what to do when it goes wrong and the same goes for the water too.

"I think we were very lucky to have Hugh come here and do his windmills.

"By now, I guess, solar would have come in if wind hadn't - and we were just relying on Tilley lamps.

"Everybody expects washing machines now here and everybody has one apart from me. I'm the last person washing by hand here."

Natalie, 37

"I've had five visits here now as I'm interested in communities.

"Some sailors I met on Shetland called me a drifter and I quite liked that.

"Somebody wrote a song about me called Natalie the Nomad. It's what I do - I just drift along with what's happening.

"I think it would be easier for my parents if I lived an ordinary life - they struggle and they worry. But I have never met anyone who gives me a hard time.

"People try to get me into the ordinary - it's hard for people to understand that I don't want a job or to pay the price for what comes with it.

"Generally, if you have a job you are part of the monetary system. I do spend money - but it's a choice.

"I mean, when do you ever really have to spend money? You can always say no. What do I really have to do in life, except breathing?"

Dale, 47

"I was fed up with working in an office all day looking at a screen and having to pay to go to a gym to keep fit.

"I was fed up with all the people - it would take me 40 minutes to drive seven miles to get into work.

"We could have moved not so far away but I had been to Scotland a few times and fancied it.

"There is a proper sense of community here, which I think is lacking in other parts of the country.

"Everybody knows everybody and everybody helps each other out.

"It's the environmental thing, where you can live from solar and wind power and you don't need coal and nuclear power.

"And because you know what you are consuming, where your water comes from and your power, you are always going to be environmentally friendly.

"I used to preach about environmental stuff and then go home and put my 48in flat-screen TV on - but here, you can really live it."

BREXIT: MAY HEADS TO BRUSSELS ON EVE OF CRUCIAL EU SUMMIT

 EPATheresa May is facing obstacles to her Brexit plan at home and in Europe

Theresa May is heading to Brussels later ahead of a critical EU summit to formally sign off the Brexit deal.

The prime minister will hold talks with top EU officials, before leaders of all 28 countries meet to endorse the agreement on Sunday.

However, Spain has said it will not attend unless a last-minute spat over Gibraltar is sorted out.

Even if the EU approves the deal, Mrs May must still persuade enough MPs to support it which could prove difficult.

Meanwhile the leader of the DUP - which Mrs May relies on for support in Parliament - will reiterate her opposition of the deal at her party conference later, after threatening to look again at the confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives if it gets through Parliament.

What will happen at the summit?

On Saturday, Mrs May will meet with the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and European Council President Donald Tusk for talks.

Then on Sunday, EU leaders will meet for the special Brexit summit. They will be asked to approve two key Brexit documents:

The political declaration, which sets out what the UK and EU's relationship will be like after Brexit - outlining how things like UK-EU trade and security will work

The EU withdrawal agreement: a 585-page, legally-binding document setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU. It covers the UK's £39bn "divorce bill", citizens' rights and the thorny issue of the Northern Ireland "backstop" - to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What's in the political declaration?

BBC News correspondent Kevin Connolly said some member states are "suspicious of the possibility the UK might be attempting some last-minute negotiations" on Saturday.

There is no formal vote on Sunday but the EU expects to proceed after reaching a consensus.

Why is Spain unhappy?

Spain has raised last-minute objections to how the issue of Gibraltar - a British Overseas Territory with 30,000 residents, 96% whom voted to remain in the EU - has been handled in the Brexit talks so far.

It wants the UK to publish a written statement promising that Spain will be directly consulted on questions relating to Gibraltar during its future trade negotiations with the EU.

On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he will not decide whether to attend Sunday's summit until the assurances are provided.

 ReutersMr Sanchez is pro-European and it is not in his nature to scupper EU plans, the BBC's Katya Adler said

Although one country on its own cannot block the withdrawal agreement being approved, there is "no way the EU can rubber stamp a text when an existing member is so strongly opposed", said BBC News' Europe editor Katya Adler.

Gibraltar is believed to be the only outstanding issue ahead of the summit.

France, Denmark and the Netherlands had raised concerns over what the political declaration said about fishing rights in UK waters - but this issue is understood to have been resolved.

What happens after the summit?

If the EU signs off the withdrawal deal, Mrs May will then need to persuade MPs in her own Parliament to back it.

A vote in Parliament is expected to happen in December.

Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the DUP have all said they will vote against the government's deal.

Some of Mrs May's own Conservative MPs - the hardline Brexiteers - are also highly critical of the deal and are unlikely to support it, while other Remainer Tory MPs may also vote against it.

If MPs back the deal, it then has to be ratified by the European Parliament.

Once the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 - which will happen with or without a deal - the details of a long-term trade deal will be worked out during a 21-month transition period until December 2020.

But if the deal is defeated, a number of things could happen - including leaving in March without a deal, a second attempt to get the Brexit deal passed, another referendum or a general election.

What does Theresa May say about the deal?

On Friday, the PM said the UK should not hope for a "better deal" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement.

But she declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be "different".

Meanwhile, the Telegraph said it has seen leaked Cabinet papers which suggest the PM is planning to "reframe the Brexit debate around migration" - by planning restrictions on low-skilled migrants coming to the UK - in a bid to attract the support of hard Brexiteers ahead of the House of Commons vote.

Does the DUP's support matter?

Yes. After the 2017 general election, Mrs May's Conservative Party got 318 seats - four short of the number she needed to rule with a majority government.

The DUP formed a confidence and supply agreement with the Tories, promising that its 10 MPs would vote with the government, and therefore enable it to win key votes in Parliament.

The DUP opposes the Brexit deal because of the "backstop" - the last resort back-up plan to make sure a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland never happens.

It will only come into effect if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal. But the backstop would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.

DID A SERIAL KILLER MURDER MY SISTER?

Olive Wiley has a mixture of brisk efficiency and warmth and it’s no surprise to find out she was a nurse. Now retired, for decades she worked in intensive care at the now closed Tyrone county hospital – including in the dark days after the Omagh bomb. She’s still dealing with those memories. Olive has never got over the death of her younger sister Katrina – Reenie to her family – who died in 2006. The way their large family worked, you looked after the sibling next in line. Katrina was Olive’s responsibility. And that weighs heavily on her. Katrina Fulton – her married name – was always a free spirit. She thought it was funny to keep Olive on her toes, her sister recalls - one time going missing for several weeks until Olive tracked her down. But the sisters were very close – and Katrina kept in touch with relatives throughout Ireland and England. “She’d have been able to tell you what anybody was doing and what was happening with their kids,” says Olive. On the surface, Katrina’s life looked picture perfect. “Katrina was really, really tidy, her house was absolutely perfect, she just seemed to have her life so under control, her kids were always immaculately dressed.” But when Katrina’s marriage ended, she turned to alcohol. Gradually, she became part of the circle of drinkers on the Mullaghmore estate. Olive would call around to Katrina’s house on the estate regularly, often after a busy shift at the hospital. After all, she was the sister charged with keeping an eye on Katrina. She got to know the circle and liked them. The only one Olive never liked was Noel Knox, who she describes as obnoxious, nasty and rude. “I hated him,” she says. “He wasn’t a pleasant person. When you went into the house and there were a number of people there.

He always had to be the dominant person, the person who was speaking the loudest.

Olive and Noel argued. Whatever the subject, Noel knew better, she says – even when Olive was advising Katrina to take her medication. Olive would ask him to leave her alone with her sister and Noel would refuse. Katrina always backed Noel up. Katrina never admitted to Olive that she was in a relationship with Noel, but her sister is confident she was. The circle of drinkers fell apart – some died, some went their separate ways, until it was only ever Noel that she saw when she went to Katrina’s house. Sometimes her sister wouldn’t let her in and would shout out the window that she wasn’t to come in as she would only fight with Noel. Sometimes Olive was happy enough to leave, knowing Katrina was OK without having got through the door. Katrina often had bruises, but as a nurse Olive knew she was more prone to them because of her heavy drinking. She didn’t particularly worry until the hospital phoned her three years before Katrina’s death to say that she had suffered a head injury. When Olive got there, Katrina was having stitches applied to the wound. She was drunk and confused and it was not clear what had happened. As she was being taken to the ward, Katrina’s condition suddenly deteriorated. She’d had a massive bleed in her brain. Doctors held out little hope but, miraculously, Olive says, Katrina recovered. After a week, Katrina returned to her house. From then on, Olive says Katrina let few people other than Noel into her home. Katrina thought he looked after her, says Olive. “He was doing things like getting money out with her bank card and probably buying alcohol for both of them,” she says.

I just think that he bullied her and manipulated her and made her believe that he was the only person that she needed to be around.

Olive still called around but more often than not, her sister wouldn’t let her in. Olive thinks she was frightened of angering Knox. One April day in 2006, another relative of Katrina’s went to check on her.

“He came into the house and went up the stairs and walked into the bedroom and Noel Knox was standing there,” says Olive. “As soon as he walked into the bedroom Noel Knox walked out.” The relative went over to the bed and found Katrina seriously ill, in a semi-conscious state. He rang Olive. They couldn’t get an ambulance so she helped him carry Katrina to her car. As they were putting her in, Noel Knox re-appeared. “He came slinking around the corner and said: ‘Did I leave my coat in there?’” He went into the house, got his coat and left without asking how Katrina was. He never did ask about her condition. Days later, she died.

Katrina Fulton's death certificate

Katrina Fulton’s death certificate records her death as due to broncho-pneumonia, caused by advanced liver failure, due to cirrhosis of the liver. But Olive says her sister seemed normal when she had seen her just a few days earlier. “I just wonder at that man being in that room and what he could have done to her,” she says. She can’t understand why Noel Knox didn’t call an ambulance for her sister. “He wasn’t doing anything, he wasn’t making any attempt to help her, or get help for her, or tell anyone that she was ill.” She now wishes the police had investigated how Katrina had become so ill, so quickly. “I think they just assumed it was her alcoholism made her semi-conscious without looking to see if it could have been something different.” She remembers clearly what a medical professional said to her about the Mullaghmore circle: “It’s just a drinking den, they’re all drinkers and they’re all gradually going to die off.” Olive questions how fully the authorities investigate the deaths of alcoholics.

Just because they were drunk, doesn’t mean that whatever happened to them just happened out of drunkenness.

That’s something Coroner Joe McCrisken rejects. “It’s never assumed that this is a person who has died because they’ve had a high level of alcohol taken,” he says. “The fact that someone has chronic alcoholism and a medic or pathologist thinks that is the cause of death, if I think there are other issues around that, I’ll question that.” Olive is a childhood friend of the journalist Anton McCabe. After the inquest into the death of Mairéad McCallion in 2017, he put her in touch with Patricia O’Brien. As they spoke on the phone, the two women noticed striking similarities in their sisters’ relationships with Noel Knox. They compared how their sisters became isolated from their families, how they were pursued by Knox, how he used to phone or text them “non-stop” when they were away from him. Patricia recalled her sister, Mairéad.

Mairéad was a smart girl but he had beat her down so much that she thought nobody else loved her and that’s what he was constantly telling her.

CLIMATE CHANGE: REPORT WARNS OF GROWING IMPACT ON US LIFE

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world

Unchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life, a US government report warns.

"Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today," the 4th National Climate Assessment says.

The report says climate change is "presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth".

The warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda.

Sounding an alarm

By James Cook, Los Angeles correspondent, BBC News

During a blast of icy weather in Washington this week, Donald Trump tweeted, "whatever happened to global warming?"

Now, without mentioning the president, his own scientists have answered their boss's question in comprehensive detail.

Global warming is here in the United States, they say - now. It is already deadly serious and without urgent, dramatic change, it will be catastrophic.

 EPAThe report warns that the frequency of wildfires could increase if climate change is unchecked

This report is striking for two reasons. First, it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples - overwhelmed dams in South Carolina; failing crops in the parched Great Plains; a rise in insect-borne disease in Florida.

And, secondly, it majors on the economic impact, in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation.

With warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure, falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity, the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life.

The White House said the report - compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments - was inaccurate.

Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was "largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population".

The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity.

What does the report say?

The US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society.

"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states," the report says.

"Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century."

The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events.

But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and "to adapt to the changes that will occur".

What reaction has there been?

Environmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action.

Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, said the report made it clear that climate change was not "some problem in the distant future".

"It's happening right now in every part of the country," she said.

This bar in San Francisco had a climate change message during a summit in the city in September

That view was echoed by Abigail Dillen, president of environmental group Earthjustice.

"While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, his own administration is sounding the alarm," she said.

What does President Trump say about climate change?

In October, President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a "political agenda", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures.

After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels.

At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new "fair" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.

During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was "a hoax". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: "I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference."

How great is the climate threat?

A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could only be stopped if the world made major, and costly, changes.

That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops.

If the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

HATS, JEWELLERY, COFFEE: THE ODD ADS POPPING UP ON FACEBOOK'S 'POLITICAL' LIST

 FacebookAt least 26 commercial adverts - like this one for a line of hats - have been spotted in Facebook's library for political ads

Dozens of adverts for hats, jewellery, clothing and other things with no apparent political message whatsoever have been added to Facebook's new library of UK political ads.

Last month, Facebook announced the creation of a database that lists UK political adverts on the platform along with the names of the people who paid for them.

At the moment, inclusion in the database is voluntary, but the company hopes to apply the rules to all political advertisers in the near future and require them to sign up.

The initiative came in response to political pressure the company has faced over allegations of data misuse by Cambridge Analytica and the role the social media giant played in the 2016 US presidential election and the UK's EU referendum.

Similar libraries are already available in the US and in Brazil.

Hats, beauty treatments, and jewellery

Among more than 1,200 UK ads listed in the database, BBC Trending spotted at least 26 that are for commercial companies and have no readily apparent political agenda.

They include a hat seller, a fashion boutique, a magazine, a coffee company, an online jewellery store, and others.

 FacebookAdverts for an indie/folk gig appeared in Facebook's 'political' ad database...

 Facebook... along with ads for a coffee company, a jewellery company and beauty treatments

It's still unclear how these adverts ended up in the UK library, but similar non-political ads can also be spotted in the US and Brazilian databases.

What exactly happened?

The ads, spotted by the BBC, indicate that Facebook does not have humans overseeing the library.

Facebook told BBC Trending it is investigating the matter and suggested that in some cases the advertisers themselves may have inadvertently flagged their adverts as "political" by failing to untick a box during the ad-buying process.

The UK company with most adverts listed in the database, hat seller Concept Cap, said that it was unaware its adverts had been dubbed "political" until it was contacted by the BBC.

"We were trying to set up product tagging on Instagram to help brand growth," a Concept Cap spokesperson said. Product tagging embeds keywords in posts, to make them more visible when users are searching for particular words and phrases.

"And to do that, you need to get verified by Facebook and send a form of ID, which we did", the spokesperson said. "After that, we got a message saying it was okay for us to post political and religious views."

Concept Cap said its hats and its adverts contained no political messages at all.

Transparency questions

A number of media reports in recent weeks have raised questions over how effective Facebook's new tools could actually be in making political advertising more transparent.

Last month, a Vice News journalist successfully applied to buy fake ads on behalf of all 100 sitting US Senators. Shortly after, a Business Insider reporter succeeded in publishing a fake advert purporting to have been paid by scandal-hit Cambridge Analytica.

Evidence given to the UK Parliament's inquiry into fake news has also identified what appears to be a large Brexit-backing advertising campaign run by an website called Mainstream Network.

 Mainstream NetworkMainstream Network's website has been online since late 2017

Campaign group 89up estimated that Mainstream Network spent up to £257,000 on adverts urging Facebook users to "bin Chequers".

It remains unclear who is behind Mainstream Network, and the page does not appear to have run any advertisements on Facebook since the new political advertising rules were announced on 16 October.

Facebook has refused to divulge any information about the people behind Mainstream Network's page and their new library does not include any political ads bought before their archive was unveiled.

'MOST' INTERNSHIPS UNPAID IN RETAILING AND THE ARTS



Most internships in retailing, the arts and the media are unpaid, according to a survey from the Sutton Trust - a body that campaigns for social mobility.

It surveyed more than 2,600 graduates aged between 21 and 29.

The highest proportions of unpaid internships were found in retail (89%), the arts (86%) and the media (83%).

The report coincides with a bill to ban unpaid internships of more than four weeks, which will be brought before the House of Commons on Friday.

More than a quarter of graduates surveyed had taken an unpaid internship the survey found.

"Unpaid internships prevent young people from low and moderate-income backgrounds from accessing careers in some of the most desirable sectors such as journalism, fashion, the arts and law," said Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust.

"This is a huge social mobility issue. It prevents these young people from getting a foot on the ladder."

While unpaid internships were the norm in popular industries, they were less common elsewhere. The survey found that in the IT sector just 26% of interns had been unpaid.

For its study the trust defined any internship that paid less than the minimum wage, or expenses only, as unpaid.

Its survey covered internships that varied in length, from less than a month to more than six months.

Grey area

The report also suggested there was confusion among graduates and employers about the current rules governing internships.

At the moment the National Minimum Wage must be paid to interns who work set hours or are given specific tasks by a manager who oversees how they are done.

But a spokesperson for the Sutton Trust said the guidelines from HMRC leave a grey area, which is why the organisation is pushing for the rules to be tightened up.

Many respondents to the Trust's survey needed help while on their internship.

The results showed that 43% of unpaid interns lived for free with family or friends, 26% needed money from their parents and 27% took a paid job to fund their internship.

Reality Check: Am I an intern or a worker?



At the moment in the UK, there's no legal definition of an "internship" or "work placement". Employers have to pay interns the National Minimum Wage if they're classed as a "worker".

You're usually classified as a worker if you have set hours, duties or responsibilities. For example, when:

You have a contract or another arrangement to do work for a reward

Your reward is money or another benefit, like the promise of work or a contract in the future

There are set hours you have to work

But, there are a few exceptions.

If you're shadowing someone else in the workplace, or taking part in an internship for less than a year that's part of a higher education course, you're not due the National Minimum Wage.

When it comes to working for a registered charity as a volunteer, you aren't entitled to the minimum wage either, although you might have some expenses paid for lunch or travel.

Interns 'trapped'

The Sutton Trust survey also found "some evidence" that doing several unpaid internships might be bad for employment prospects.

More than 70% of respondents to the survey who were doing their fourth or fifth internships said they were unpaid.

Of those that only did one internship 62% were unpaid.

"This suggests that many young people in certain industries are being trapped in cycles of unpaid placements without significant benefits to their career," the report said.

IPSWICH SCHOOL TRIGGERS INQUIRY INTO 'PUPIL AGED 30'

The Home Office is investigating how a man, possibly aged in his 30s, could have joined Stoke High School in Ipswich

An adult asylum seeker who posed as a 15-year-old student is being investigated by the government.

The Home Office confirmed it will be looking into how the man, who could be as old as 30, was allowed to join Stoke High School in Ipswich.

An age assessment carried out by the local authority found the individual to be over 18, meaning he could now face deportation.

The Home Office said age disputed cases "remain a challenging area of work".

A spokeswoman said: "We are fully committed to safeguarding children and are looking into the circumstances of this case to understand how it was handled.

"In the absence of clear and credible documentary evidence, Home Office staff must rely on physical appearance and demeanour to make an initial assessment on whether a person claiming to be a child is under 18.

"If an individual is assessed to be under 18 but subsequent concerns about their age are raised - for example, by a school - we will act quickly to reconsider the case."

Earlier this month, a pupil at Stoke High shared an image on social media with the message: "How's there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?"

The school, which initially contacted the Home Office, previously said it had "followed government and local authority policies and guidance, as we do for any asylum admissions matter".

It added the pupil "was not attending the school at this time".

10 THINGS WE'VE LEARNED FROM SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH

By Fraser McAlpine, 22 November 2018

Sir David Attenborough is a man whose achievements are well celebrated. And yet, he continues to surprise us with unexpected delights and fascinating gems of knowledge.

For example, we learned from his Jo Whiley and Simon Mayo interview that he’s releasing an album, titled David Attenborough - My Field Recordings from Across the Planet, which he recorded during his early years of lugging a big recording machine across the globe for nature documentaries.

"Back in the 50s, we took the very first tape recorder that could work without mains supply... to record monkeys, birds and insects, but we also met some very interesting people and musicians," he explained. "Almost wherever we went, people had never heard a recording of themselves and it was always a bit of a mystery."

"I remember when I was recording some drums in West Africa, and the head musician didn't like it at all – he thought I was stealing his thunder. And he said 'I don’t think your machine is much, can your machine learn this music?', and we recorded it and played it back and he said, 'yes but that was a really easy piece to learn'. Then he played something really fast and when I played it back to him, he was amazed."

"It was a great privilege... We got a whole variety of stuff, and it was great fun!"

MOVING IMAGES: FIVE WORKS OF ART THAT CHANGED LOCATION

A monochrome image of a young boy stitching Union Jack bunting in a sweatshop, Slave Labour was painted on the side of a Poundland shop in North London by the secretive graffiti artist Banksy in 2012. It was widely regarded as a critique of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. It was torn from the wall in 2013 and held in storage at an unknown location.

People in Wood Green had become proud of this local landmark, and a 'Bring Back Banksy' campaign held demonstrations demanding its return. Artists have created new stencils at the site since its disappearance, raising the question of whether Slave Labour could ever be restored when the recent art is now specific to the site.

In November 2018 Slave Labour was bought at an auction in Los Angeles for £568,000 by American artist Ron English, who has worked with Banksy on various street art projects. He told reporters he intended to whitewash it and then resell it for a million dollars.

RENT FEES: NEW LAWS 'WILL NOT STOP HIDDEN CHARGES'

 Charlotte Von CreaseCharlotte says she was hit with hundreds of pounds of extra fees

Campaigners say new laws going through Parliament will not go far enough to stamp out all hidden fees and charges for renters.

Charlotte Von Crease, a 27-year-old renter, says: "When we moved into our last property we were hit with nearly £3,500 worth of fees, before we even got the keys."

However, those pre-tenancy fees are just one of the hidden costs.

Tenant campaign groups say banning them will not solve the problem.

There were the usual costs for Charlotte, such as one month's rent in advance and six weeks' rent as a deposit. But she told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money there were "also £875 worth of letting agent fees, £600 were admin fees, £120 for employers' references for both me and my partner, and £155 for an inventory check-in fee as well".

Charlotte is one of the estimated 11.5 million people who live in private rented homes in England.

Many renters complain of high upfront costs to secure a property and the Tenant Fees Bill passing through Parliament will effectively cap or ban these extra, unavoidable charges for tenants in England.

Wales has similar legislation under way and Scotland outlawed pre-tenancy fees back in 2012.

In Northern Ireland it's a more complicated picture. A judge recently ruled that tenants could not be charged upfront costs, but without a sitting assembly to bring in new rules, tenants there are still paying them.

'Frustrating experience'

But those pre-tenancy fees are just one part of the hidden costs for renters and a number of tenant campaign groups, including Shelter and Generation Rent, have expressed concern that banning them will not solve the problem.

When the new rules eventually come into force, they will not stop landlords and letting agents from charging default fees, such as cleaning costs or those for repairs. While those are often for work needed after tenants leave a property, some tenants report being charged huge amounts for tiny jobs. Some tenants say they feel ripped off.

"I've just ended 10 years of renting [and] each property was its own frustrating experience," says 30-year-old former renter Jen Eastwood.

"Never once have I received a full amount of deposit back, despite every property being returned in a better condition than when it was given to me. Twice I paid for professional cleaning and gave the receipts as proof, and still I was charged for cleaning."

Ask any group of renters about their experiences and at least some will have similar stories. Private renting has more than doubled in the past 20 years.

There's been a decline in home ownership among millennials in particular, leading more to rent for longer. Earlier this year the Institute for Fiscal Studies reported there had been a large decline in home ownership among middle-income 25-34-year-olds. In 1995-96, 65% of this group owned a home but by 2015-16 that fell to just 27%.

Shelter has said tenants are routinely being overcharged. It lists examples of tenants paying as much as £20 an hour for their landlord's time, £45 for procuring a replacement dustpan and brush - and even £100 for removing cobwebs. None of those charges will be banned by the Tenant Fees Bill.

Clearer guidelines needed

Tenants deposits are now routinely held in deposit protection schemes, meaning money is protected and they can challenge charges they think are unfair.

However, if a landlord or agent can show invoices and receipts for work carried out then it can be hard to argue it was unnecessary or unfair.

Polly Neate, chief executive of the charity, says she will welcome the new rules but tells Wake Up To Money it must go further.

Clearer guidelines on what tenants can and can't be charged for are needed, she says, to prevent landlords and agents finding "additional things" to charge for.

"Letting agents are running a business and their business is managing properties. So they ought to be able to calculate the general costs that they will incur. [These] should be part of the totally predictable cost of managing a property."

'Reasonable balance'

Tenants may feel ripped off by these fees but letting agents and landlords argue they genuinely reflect the cost of the work.

One letting agent, who did not want to be named, said: "To get anyone to show up at your door no matter what they do is £50 or something in that region. So, if a tenant is to leave a bit of fluff somewhere, someone still has to take an hour to go there, do it and come back and you have to hire a professional.

"I used to own a property and I wouldn't just run out to clear up a bit of fluff or change a bulb, I'd say it's my tenants' responsibility."

11.5m people rent in England

His comments were echoed by housing minister Heather Wheeler. "I genuinely think that you have a responsibility when you take on a property - you expect it to be in good order when you arrive, it's your job to make it in a good order when you leave."

Richard Lambert, chief executive of the National Landlords Association, said the new rules will curb abuses. "Default fees will have to be a reasonable charge for a defined purpose. But if I have to come to you to change a light bulb then I have to drive for half-an-hour, plus petrol, to carry out the work. I wouldn't be charging you anything more than what it cost me.

He said the government had tried to strike a reasonable balance between tenants and landlords.

David Cox, chief executive of Arla Propertymark, said: "Letting agent fees cover the cost of essential services during the lettings process, such as referencing, negotiations about clauses in the tenancy agreement and the inventory - processes that cost letting agents time and money to carry out.

He says research for Arla by Capital Economics showed that a full ban on tenant fees would mean two tenants would end up paying an extra £206 per year in rent.

"Ultimately, the ban doesn't reflect the value of the services which agents provide to tenants," he said.

Shelter will be answering questions about renting costs on the BBC Affordable Living Facebook page

KEANU REEVES HAS A ROLE IN TOY STORY 4



Tim Allen has revealed Keanu Reeves has a part in the Toy Story 4 movie.

Speaking to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, Allen, who voices Buzz Lightyear in the movie franchise, hinted Reeves has a part similar to his own.

"Keanu Reeves has got a great part. Even he said, gentle wonderful guy that he is, 'this sounds too much like Buzz Lightyear' and his character does have an edge to that."

Allen said the fourth instalment was "deep and moving".

But he did not reveal any more details about Reeves' character, other than to say it is smaller than Buzz Lightyear.

Last week the first trailer for Toy Story 4 was released which revealed a new character Forky, a spork which has been turned into a toy as a craft project.

Forky is voiced by comedian Tony Hale, who has appeared in hit comedies Arrested Development and Veep.

 DisneyThe teaser trailer revealed Forky is in denial about being a toy

The film is directed by Josh Cooley and sees the toys end up on a road trip alongside old and new friends.

Allen said the film's last scene was very emotional.

"Hanks said it best - of course, he always says stuff best - but the last scene of that movie, I couldn't even get through it. and I thought there were pages after it.

"I read it and I had to turn around from looking at it in the studio, it was so emotional."

He compared it with the classic final scene of Gone With the Wind.

"It's a 'Scarlett, I don't give a damn moment'," he said.

Toy Story 4 is scheduled to be released in the UK on 21 June 2019.

MICK HUCKNALL'S SECRET? KEEPING HIS MOUTH SHUT

 Brian RasicThe new album was recorded live with a 40-piece orchestra

It's been 33 years since Simply Red's debut album Picture Book introduced the world to singer Mick Hucknall's northern brand of blue-eyed soul.

They say the last thing to depart a champion boxer is his knockout punch and if a similar comparison can be made with singers, then it's the voice. Too many tours, too much hard-living and not enough rest can ravage what was once a thing of beauty.

Now, aged 58, Hucknall - who has just released a live performance CD and DVD, backed up by a full orchestra - has cottoned on to the best way of preserving what has been his livelihood for four decades.

He tries his best not to speak during the day.

Selflessly breaking his own rule, he talks to BBC News. "As I've gotten older I've got more bass in my voice but also because I don't talk very much during the day I've managed to keep my voice in good condition.

"I'm still lucky enough to be able to hit the high notes... I don't quite know how I've been so fortunate - I don't do anything to take care of my voice except not talk very much. I try to keep my voice conditioned by just not using it very much and it's paid off."

Symphonica in Rosso was recorded over three nights at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam in 2017.

Hucknall and his band are accompanied by a 40-piece orchestra as they run through hits from across their eleven albums and some jazz standards made famous by Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole.

"The initial offer came out of the blue and I replied 'yes' immediately because the last time I performed with an orchestra that size was in Greenwich on Millennium night for the BBC," says Hucknall.

"They asked me to perform what I thought was my song of the century and I chose Frank Sinatra's My Way and I performed it with the London Symphony Orchestra.

"I just chose the first song that came into my head."

He admits it's an intimidating challenge for a singer to try to match the sheer volume of a live orchestra, given he generally doesn't like to rehearse.

"It was very, very different when you perform with an orchestra - when you watch a conductor working, they are moving to a swing they are not responding directly to the beat.

"I don't usually rehearse, which scares my bandmates sometimes but in this case, I thought I'll turn up and sing a bit and keep everybody happy and I was really glad that I did because it was entirely different.

"For the first couple of hours I found it very difficult."

The band have five UK number one albums

It was back in 2009, two years after Simply Red's number four album Stay, that Hucknall announced he was bringing Simply Red to an end, 25 years after they formed in Manchester.

"I've kind of decided that the 25 years is going to be enough, so I intend that the 2009 will be the last Simply Red tour," he is reported to have said at the time.

Six years later, the band reunited for a 30th anniversary tour, out of which bloomed a new top five album Big Love and another anniversary tour the following year, this time for 25 years of their chart topping Stars - the 11th best selling album of all-time in the UK.

Hucknall insists people may have misinterpreted his seemingly self-imposed early retirement.

"If you go back to what I actually said at the time, I didn't use those kind of phrases, I didn't use the words 'splitting up' or 'breaking up'. I really was doing it because I had a luxury that most men don't have of being able to stop work and bring up my kid."

Raised by a single father after the family was abandoned by his mother when he was just three years old, Hucknall relished being in a position to be a hands-on dad.

"I didn't want to be one of those touring musicians who get to hear about their daughter taking her first steps while they're in New Zealand. I cut the cord when my baby was born, I'm around all the time and it's given me the happiest 10 years of my life."

"Bringing up my kid was the main reason why I stopped. If you don't then you've got these endless commitments. You get pressure from the record company to release an album every two years, you have to go on tour and I knew that wouldn't stop, so I said to my manager, 'I don't want to do this any more'.

According to the latest figures from the office of National Statistics, more than 232,000 men opted out of the workplace in 2018 - that is the lowest number since 2014.

And in March this year, an Equalities Select Committee report found only 2% to 8% of fathers take up shared parental leave.

"I'm glad I did what I did," insists Hucknall. "The media wants to sell things and make a story and use a phrase like 'splitting up' but stopping is not the same as splitting up."

To stamp home the point, Hucknall reveals his band have just recorded what will be their 12th studio album, which he says will be a departure from the "smoother sounds" of previous releases.

"I wanted to push my voice a little harder," he explains.

Hucknall played Glastonbury in 1986

"It's a mixture of soul and funk and rhythm and blues and it's a more direct style."

Once a mainstay of the heady 90s' London party circuit, Hucknall credits his new-found domestic bliss with a new burst of creativity.

"I'm a songwriter, my love of music has never left me and I literally don't seem to be able to stop writing songs, they keep coming. I get great creative pleasure from my work."

A songwriter he may be but writing his own memoirs apparently holds no interest for the singer whose colourful love life was once the talk of the tabloids.

"I've never been much of a celebrity," he claims. "I'll leave that to other people. My biggest thrills were encounters with great people, being complimented by George Harrison and Miles Davis.

"I met Miles in 1986 at the Grammy awards and he was heading to the bathroom and I was talking to this lovely girl and he walked by and I was so excited to see him and he turned back and said "Simply Red, right?'

"I was speechless and just nodded, he said: 'I love that album Picture Book, man', and walked away. I don't care about celebrity but give me a moment like that."

FIONA BRUCE 'IN TALKS OVER TAKING QUESTION TIME JOB'



Fiona Bruce is in talks about taking over as presenter of the discussion programme Question Time.

BBC media editor Amol Rajan said negotiations with Bruce, who presents the News at Six and Ten as well as the Antiques Roadshow, were continuing.

Current host David Dimbleby will leave the show in December after 24 years.

If Bruce succeeds Dimbleby, she will become the first full-time female host in the show's 40-year history.

The BBC's media editor said Bruce auditioned alongside several other leading broadcasters at the corporation for the job.

Senior figures at the BBC were known to want an established figure who had experience on BBC One, our correspondent added.

Bruce has worked at the BBC since 1990, when she began her career as a researcher on Panorama.

The 54-year-old went on to become a reporter on the programme and also on Newsnight.

Bruce also co-hosted Crimewatch on BBC One for eight years.

In 2001, she became the first female presenter to be part of the BBC's general election studio team.

TUBE 'JUNK FOOD' ADVERT BAN ANNOUNCED BY LONDON MAYOR

 PA"Junk food" adverts will be banned on the Underground, Overground and bus network

A ban on junk food advertising across London's entire public transport network will be introduced next year.

Under the scheme, posters for food and drink high in fat, salt and sugar will vanish from the Underground, Overground, buses and bus shelters.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said he wants to tackle the "ticking time bomb" of child obesity in the capital.

The Advertising Association has said it would have "little impact on the wider societal issues that drive obesity".

The ban will take effect across the Transport for London (TfL) network on 25 February.

The Advertising Association said commuters could suffer as a result of the ban

Where will the ban apply?

In addition to the buses, Tube and train networks which are run by TfL, junk food adverts will be banned on:

Roads controlled by TfL, including adverts on roundabouts and at bus stops

Taxis, private hire vehicles and Dial-a-Ride

River services

Tram

Emirates Air Line cable car

Victoria Coach Station

After plans were first announced in May, 82% of 1,500 respondents to an online consultation backed the proposals, City Hall said.

Mr Khan said "tough action" on child obesity was necessary.

Junk food adverts will be banned from bus stops owned by TfL

"Reducing exposure to junk food advertising has a role to play in this - not just for children, but parents, families and carers who buy food and prepare meals," he said.

The scheme is backed by child health experts including chief medical officer for England Professor Dame Sally Davies who described it as an "important step in the right direction".

However, the Advertising Association said commuters could suffer as a result of the ban.

Chief Executive Stephen Woodford said the UK already has "the strictest rules in the world when it comes to advertising high fat salt sugar foods", which mean under-16s cannot be targeted.

"This will lose revenue from advertising for TfL and that will potentially have an impact on the fares that passengers have to pay," he said.

London's mayor previously banned adverts on the Tube which promoted negative body images, following complaints about a weight-loss advert that asked customers if they were "beach body ready?"

SPAIN RAPE LAW: OUTCRY AS COURT RULES ATTACK NOT VIOLENT

After the "wolf pack" trial, demonstrations spread across Spain - this sign reads: "We want to be free"

A court's decision to clear two men of rape despite the victim begging them to stop has prompted outrage in Spain.

The court in Lleida in north-eastern Spain jailed the uncle and nephew for four-and-a-half years for sexual abuse, rather than the graver offence.

A similar verdict in a gang rape case this year prompted large demonstrations against "patriarchal" justice.

Five men were cleared of raping a teenage woman during the San Fermín bull-running festival in Pamplona.

Sexual assault charge ruled out

In the latest verdict, the court ruled that the two men had not committed a sexual assault, the equivalent to rape in Spain, because they were deemed not to have used intimidation or violence.

The uncle and nephew had met their victim in a bar and gone with her to a nightclub. The men then took her to a backstreet where she was forced into sex and a separate sexual act without her consent.

She had pleaded with the men to stop, and cried and vomited afterwards.

The two men "took advantage of her vulnerable nature, which, added to her consumption of alcohol and antidepressants, may have weakened her ability to defend herself, thus making the use of violent or intimidatory acts unnecessary", the ruling said.

And yet it added that, without intimidation or violence, the crime of sexual assault, which commands a jail term of up to 15 years, could not be applied.

Anti-violence protests

There was indignation online, with thousands sharing their anger at the decision.

One Twitter user Mercedes Domènech described the court ruling as a scandal. "If you don't defend yourself, it's not rape. If you do, they kill you."

The verdict comes as feminists around Spain prepare for a series of 200 demonstrations over the weekend to mark the UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on 25 November.

Mass protests spread across Spain in April when a court in Pamplona ruled that the five men who used a WhatsApp chat group called "the wolf pack" had not used intimidation or violence against their victim during the 2016 San Fermín festival.

The five dragged an 18 year old into an alcove at the back of a block of flats and filmed their attack with their mobile phones.

The victim said in the trial that she froze, and the judges who saw the videos described her attitude as "passive or neutral".

Laws and judges under scrutiny

The three judges in that case were involved in another controversial ruling this week, acquitting a man of attempted murder after he threatened his estranged wife with a kitchen knife and throttled her on the floor in front of their children.

The woman survived and her husband was sentenced to 10 months in prison for domestic abuse, although even his defence lawyers reportedly asked for a two-year jail term for actual bodily harm.

After the "wolf pack" ruling, Spain's government asked a group of legal experts to revise the sexual assault laws, with a view to unifying the different offences under the umbrella term rape.

Amnesty International released a report on Thursday criticising the absence of policies in Spain to help women who suffer from sexual violence, and pointing to a legal system that discourages victims from coming forward.

BREXIT: WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF MPS REJECT THERESA MAY'S DEAL?

 PA

It feels like Westminster is tumbling towards a political crisis without modern precedent.

Soon, perhaps in the second week of December, the House of Commons will debate and then vote upon a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU.

But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed.

She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it.

But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday.

With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons.

Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens.

But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then?

No route forward?

It is the burning question in Westminster and everyone has an opinion.

This week, the new work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd said the House of Commons "will stop no deal".

Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it was "very difficult to predict at the moment what the final outcome will be".

And the former Tory cabinet minister (and now advocate for another referendum) Justine Greening said there was "no majority for any route forward".

Which may be true but doesn't solve the huge political problem MPs will face if the deal is chucked out.

Leave without a deal

Crucially, the default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal.

Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019.

That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK.

If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next.

Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on "how it proposes to proceed".

The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan?

Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen.

The motion would probably not be amendable, nor would its defeat carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March.

Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal.

As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, "there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute."

Have another go

 PASir David Natzler (seated, front left) says MPs could vote again

But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality.

The maximum three week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play.

The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons.

Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible.

"The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different", Sir David said.

Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs.

Another referendum



But with the Commons so fractured in its various objections would that make much difference?

More significant could be panic on the markets and that might change minds in parliament.

Alternatively, MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit.

At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum.

The Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too.

However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it.

Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton.

A general election



But perhaps there will be a general election instead?

That is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected.

There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act and both involve motions of confidence in the Commons.

But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, "with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem."

That will be the other critical factor at play.

Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period (and Number 10 has ruled that out) the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight.

The clock won't wait.

'Negotiated no deal'



Another idea that has been floated is a "negotiated no deal" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms.

Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote.

Because Parliament will have to come to a view.

As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: "We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view.

"I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament."

Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process.

Instead, she faces three fraught weeks and a vote that will define the country's future for many years.

Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons.

But the mood in Westminster could shift quickly in the current pandemonium.

WOMEN'S FC BASEL TEAM NOT INVITED TO CLUB ANNIVERSARY GALA

 Catherine Ivill/The men's team were guests at the gala but the players from the women's team were asked to sell tombola tickets

A gala to celebrate FC Basel's 125th anniversary has caused controversy after the women's team was not invited - but asked to work at the event instead.

The Swiss football club's female side were selling tombola tickets to more than a thousand guests while the men's team had a three-course meal.

After finishing their work, the women were given sandwiches to eat in a different room, CNN reported.

A spokesman for the club said the women "agreed to help" as some of the money raised at the gala was going to their team.

 FC BaselFC Basel said that "many employees were helping in different ways at the event"

None of the players from the women's team have publicly commented about the incident. But the story has prompted a reaction on social media with some Twitter users describing it as "outrageous" and "shocking".

Others said the incident proved there is still gender inequality in sport.

"Since it was our 125th anniversary it was clear, that our first team would take a part in it, vicarious for all the previous teams who wrote our history since the founding in 1893.

A GUIDE TO AFRICA'S 'LOOTED TREASURES'

During colonial rule in Africa, thousands of cultural artefacts were plundered. African countries want them back and major museums across Europe have agreed to loan the famous Benin Bronzes back to Nigeria. Now France has launched a report calling for thousands of African art in its museums to be returned to the continent.

Benin Bronzes

 British Museum

The Benin Bronzes, which are actually made of brass, are a collection of delicately made sculptures and plaques that adorned the royal palace of the Oba, Ovonramwen Nogbaisi, in the Kingdom of Benin, which was incorporated into British-ruled Nigeria.

They were carved out of ivory, brass, ceramic and wood.

Many of the pieces were cast for the ancestral altars of past kings and queen mothers.

In 1897, the British launched a punitive expedition against Benin, in response to an attack on a British diplomatic expedition.

Apart from bronze sculptures and plaques, innumerable royal objects were taken as a result of the mission and are scattered all over the world.

These Benin Bronze artefacts were returned to in Nigeria in 2014 by a British pensioner

The British Museum in London says many of the objects from Benin in its collection were given to it in 1898 by the Foreign Office and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.

In October, top museums in Europe agreed to loan crucial artefacts back to Nigeria for the new Royal Museum, which it plans to open in 2021.

Man-eaters of Tsavo

 Field Museum of Natural History

These were two infamous lions from the Tsavo region in Kenya, East Africa that killed and ate railway workers on the British Kenya-Uganda at the end of the 19th Century.

The labourers were building the railway line between Mombasa and Lake Victoria over nine months in 1898.

 Field Museum of Natural HistoryLt Col John Patterson pictured with one of the lions he killed

The two killer beasts were eventually shot dead by British engineer Lieutenant Colonel John Patterson, at the helm of the railway project.

The stuffed lions were purchased from Patterson by the Field Museum of Natural History in the US city of Chicago in 1925 and catalogued into the museum's permanent collections.

Lt Col Patterson reported the lions' feeding frenzy took the lives of 135 railway workers and black Africans, but the Field Museum says later research conducted by its scientists drastically reduced that estimate to 35.

The Kenya National Museum wants the lions returned.

Rosetta Stone



The 1.12m (3ft 6in) high Rosetta Stone in the British Museum is originally from Egypt and is a stele made out of granodiorite, which is a coarse-grained rock.

It is a broken part of a bigger slab with text carved on to it that has helped researchers learn how to read Egyptian hieroglyphs - a form of writing that used pictures as signs.

It features three columns of the same inscription in three languages: Greek, hieroglyphs and demotic Egyptian - and is the text of a decree written by priests in 196 BC, during the reign of pharaoh Ptolemy V.

It is unclear how the stone was discovered in July 1799, but there's a general belief that it was found by soldiers fighting with the French military leader Napoleon Bonaparte as they were building an extension to a fort near the town of Rashid - also known as Rosetta - in the Nile Delta.

When Napoleon was defeated, the British took possession of the stone under the terms of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801.

It was then transported to England, arriving in Portsmouth in February 1802. George III offered it to the British Museum a few months later.

Bangwa Queen

 Dapper Foundation

The 32in (81cm) tall Bangwa Queen is a wooden carving from Cameroon, representing the power and health of the Bangwa people.

It is one of the world's most famous pieces of African art and has huge sacred significance for Cameroonians.

Sculptures were made of titled royal wives or princesses and would be referred to as Bangwa Queens in the Bangwa land of present-day Lebialem district of Cameroon's South-West region.

The Bangwa Queen was either given to or looted by the German colonial agent Gustav Conrau in around 1899 before the territory was colonised.

It ended up in the Museum für Völkerkunde in Berlin and was then bought by an art collector in 1926.

According to the New York Times, US art collector Harry A Franklin bought the carving in 1966 for $29,000 and after his death it sold at a Sotheby's auction for $3.4m.

Surrealist portrait photographer Man Ray also included the Queen of Bangwa in a 1937 portrait of a nude model - in what the New York Times says became one of his famous images.

The Dapper Foundation in Paris, France now owns the Bangwa Queen sculpture - and it was on display at the Musée Dapper until 2017 when the museum that focused on African art closed because of low attendance and high maintenance costs.

Traditional leaders of the Bangwa have been corresponding with the foundation, requesting its return to Cameroon.

Authors of the report commissioned by President Macron, Senegalese writer and economist Felwine Sarr and French Historian Bénédicte Savoy, have recommended that French law is changed to allow the return of the African art.

Maqdala treasures

 V&A MuseumThis crown is admired for its filigree designs and religious embossed images

The Maqdala treasures include an 18th Century gold crown and a royal wedding dress, taken from Ethiopia (formerly Abyssinia) by the British army in 1868.

Historians say 15 elephants and 200 mules were needed to cart away all the loot from Maqdala, Emperor Tewodros II's northern citadel capital.

The British raided Maqdala in protest at the detention of its consul when relations between the two powers deteriorated.

Some of the treasures were later deposited at the UK's Victoria and Albert Museum.

 V&A MuseumMade in the 1860s, this wedding dress is thought to have belonged to Queen Woyzaro Terunesh

The crown, admired for its silver and copper filigree designs and religious embossed images, and royal wedding dress are significant symbols of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

Scholars believe the crown was commissioned in the 1740s by Empress Mentewwab and her son King Iyyasu and given as a gift to a church in Gondar, together with a solid gold chalice.

The dress and jewellery belonged to Emperor Tewodros II's widow, Queen Woyzaro Terunesh.

Ethiopia lodged a claim in 2007 for the return of the antiquities. In April this year, the V&A offered to return the treasures to Ethiopia on loan.

Zimbabwe bird

 WikiCommons

A soapstone sculpture of a fish eagle is Zimbabwe's main national emblem. Eight of the Zimbabwe Birds were looted from the ruins of an ancient city.

Only eight of the birds were ever recovered. They stood on the walls and monoliths of the ancient city built between the 12th and 15th Centuries by the ancestors of the Shona people.

Seven of the carvings are in Zimbabwe since 2003 when the bottom section of one was returned by Germany.

It had ended up in the hands of a German missionary who sold it to the Ethnological Museum in Berlin in 1907.

Then after Soviet troops invaded Germany at the end of the World War Two, it was moved from Berlin to Leningrad and remained there to the end of the Cold War and then returned to Germany.

The eighth remains in the old bedroom of 19th Century British imperialist Cecil Rhodes, whose home in the South African city of Cape Town is now a museum.

He had taken a number of birds from Great Zimbabwe to South Africa in 1906. South Africa returned four of them in 1981, a year after Zimbabwe gained its independence.

THE FOOTBALL TEAM, FORMED IN THE SHADOW OF FAMINE, THAT FOUGHT XENOPHOBIA AND RAISED MONEY FOR IMPOVERISHED IMMIGRANTS

Fighting anti-Irish sentiment

In 1875, local priest Canon Hannon set up Hibs to alleviate boredom among the highly-condensed population of young Irish men.

Hibs initially found it difficult to get a game against other Scottish teams due to anti-Irish sentiment. They also found it difficult to register with the Scottish Football Association (SFA); they were refused each time they applied.

The persistence of Canon Hannon eventually paid off, however. On Christmas Day 1875, local soon-to-be-rivals Heart of Midlothian agreed to play a game against Hibs — a move which eventually led to Hibernian Football Club’s admission to the SFA.

Canon Hannon’s charitable gesture in starting up Hibs raised a lot of money for the impoverished Irish community in Edinburgh.

This early example of a football club both raising money for charity and providing outreach to immigrant communities is something that persists to this day.

MCFADDEN'S COLD WAR MAKES PHIL MITCHELL ADVENT CALENDAR STAR

Forget the high-end items found in posh Advent calendars, there's another sold-out item in town - and this one has gone back to basics.

But while the McFadden's Cold War calendar features old-school pictures behind the "windows", don't expect to see a robin on the third and mistletoe on the ninth.

The product is the brainchild of Christopher Spencer. He's the Birmingham artist with strong political opinions behind the popular McFadden's Cold War Twitter account.

It specialises in crude collages that imagine a bleak, post-Brexit Britain. And as with the Twitter feed, EastEnders actor Steve McFadden is the calendar's main draw.

The front of the not-so-festive countdown features him clutching a bottle of booze in a filthy squat.

'Looking aghast'

It's a sell-out but Spencer has auctioned one off online in aid of mental health charity Mind. On Friday, the highest bid of £410 landed the winner with not only a calendar but an autographed, deep-fill, Fray Bentos pie - a product he regularly features in the dystopian montages that delight his more than 100,000 Twitter followers.

Explaining the reasoning behind the auction, public sector worker Spencer, 43, said: "I've suffered with depression and anxiety the whole of my adult life. I reached a particularly low point in February 2016 when I had a breakdown but then this came about as a coping mechanism, really."

And why is McFadden the protagonist in the works?

"He's like the everyman, he's the incongruous figure in these scenes, looking with disdain or looking aghast at what's going on. He is us, slumped, looking on, despairing," Spencer said.

We're still a few days away from 1 December, though, so any chance of a hint of what's to come?

Spencer remains tight-lipped.

"You've got no chance", he said. "People have said to me this is the first time they've bought an Advent calendar in 50 years so I don't want to have any spoilers.

"But it's a memento of an awful time, the last Christmas before Brexit - it's a kind of anti-Advent calendar."

Just like the surprise of the Advent calendar windows, no-one knows what the post-Brexit future holds.

One thing's for sure, McFadden will feature in both.

But how will the Christmas scenes live up to the Twitter account's images of an uncertain political landscape?

Here's a round up of some classics.

This one features various Brexit-related figures, North Korea's Kim Jong-un and not only McFadden but fellow EastEnder Danny Dyer, a little (not lorra) Cilla Black, and Noel Edmonds. Deal or no deal indeed.

 @Coldwar_SteveIs this Britain's future?

"I think this is a great time for satire," Spencer said, "especially with Brexit and how it's going. It's completely horrendous and I wanted to present these topics in an absurd way, to show how farcical it all is."

Talking of farcical, here's Give Us A Clue-era Lionel Blair entertaining Jose Mourinho, Kanye West, the TV presenter Nick Knowles and a big breakfast-eating Pete Doherty. Two words... sounds like...

 @Coldwar_SteveLionel Blair tries to "give us a clue" in another image of a dystopian Britain

Meanwhile, former Smiths frontman Morrissey walks away from cheap tea with Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom while erstwhile England manager Sam Allardyce drives a van emblazoned in presidential imagery. McFadden prefers two wheels.

 @Coldwar_SteveEvery day is like Sunday - Moz mash-up

Nick Knowles makes a return here, but cannot join the table where the big decisions are made by McFadden, singer Olly Murs and Theresa May. Shane Richie, yet another Albert Square alumnus, is having a think in a biker's jacket.

 @Coldwar_SteveFor better or Murs

And how about this slightly football-themed one? Ex-England forward Peter Beardsley and former Premier League manager Ron Atkinson go about their business as the president of the United States points to an LP from impressionist Alistair McGowan - all under the watchful eye of McFadden and Coronation Street's Jim McDonald.

 @Coldwar_SteveHas Peter Beardsley got the new-look world in motion?

Spencer said: "I mix celebrities with politicians to show how indistinguishable they all are now.

"We have Donald Trump in the White House - it's not much different from having a Z-list celebrity in there."

CULT COMEDY DINNER FOR ONE TO GET UK PREMIERE AFTER 50 YEARS

 Norddeutscher RundfunkA still from Dinner for One starring Freddie Frinton

A comedy featuring a British music hall star that enjoys cult status in Germany is to receive its UK premiere more than 50 years after it was made.

Dinner for One - staring Freddie Frinton - was filmed by a German TV company in 1963.

It has been shown every New Year's Eve on German TV since 1972, winning it a place in the Guinness Book of Records.

It will finally get its UK premiere this weekend at a comedy film festival in Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute.

Frinton originally performed the sketch on stage in Blackpool, but it was turned into an 18-minute film for German television.

He plays a loyal butler - James - who is helping his employer celebrate her 90th birthday.

Her four male admirers are long dead, so he takes on all their roles at a dinner party, becoming increasingly tipsy as the evening progresses.

Watching it has become a New Year's tradition in Germany. The Guinness Book of Records accords it the status of the most repeated programme ever.

Freddie Frinton is a household name in Germany. A stamp has just been issued, 50 years after his death, and next year a museum dedicated to him will open in the town of Bremerhaven.

Yet his most famous sketch has never been shown in a British cinema or shown in full on British television.

Mr Frinton's family have now given permission for it to be screened as part of the Scottish Comedy Film Festival's Slapstick Weekend, which takes place at Campbeltown Picture House.

The film will be shown at the recently-restored Campbeltown Picture House

His son Mike said: "We, as family, are delighted that Campbeltown Picture House will be the first UK cinema to screen the legendary Dinner for One and that Freddie Frinton's comedy genius will be celebrated as part of the nationwide BFI season.

"Germany, and a large part of Europe, have been enjoying Dinner for One as an annual New Year treat for nearly half a century, and it makes us so proud that, finally, this perfect example of comedy timing can be appreciated over here.

"Dad would have been humbled to find himself in such illustrious comedy company."

Mike will be in Campbeltown for the screening.

Meet the Wife

Freddie Frinton was born in Grimsby and made his name as a music hall performer.

He came to broader fame as Thora Hird's co-star in the 1960s BBC comedy Meet The Wife but died in 1968 aged just 59.

The screening is a coup for Campbeltown Picture House which reopened a year ago after a £3m restoration.

The art nouveau cinema on the banks of Campbeltown Loch is one of the oldest cinema buildings in Europe.

Several other slapstick films are being shown as part of the festival. A public custard pie fight is also planned.

INDIA AND PAKISTAN REACH DEAL ON NEW ROAD TO SIKH TEMPLE

India and Pakistan have agreed to construct a new border entry point and road to allow Sikh pilgrims from India to visit a shrine in Pakistan.

Sikhism was born in Punjab, a region that was divided between the two countries during partition in 1947.

The Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur is one of Sikhism's holiest shrines. The religion's founder, Guru Nanak, spent the last 18 years of his life there.

The decision coincides with the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak's birth.

Since the division of India and Pakistan into two separate nations, Indians have had limited access to the shrine, often struggling to get visas to visit, says BBC Punjabi's Dalip Kumar.

Correspondents believe the announcement signals a thaw in relations between the two countries, which have fought three wars and a limited conflict since 1947.

Tensions flared in September over a set of stamps released by Pakistan which carried images of what the country called "atrocities in Indian-occupied Kashmir".

Delhi said it would fully fund construction of the new road on the Indian side, and Pakistan said it would do the same on its side.

Pakistan's Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry called the decision a "victory for the peace lobby" in both countries.

Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that pilgrims to the temple would be given "facilities similar to those of an international airport".

Pakistan is likely to begin construction on its side of the road later this month. A start date for work on the Indian side is yet to be announced.

ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIA'S 'MIND-BLOWING' STRUGGLE FOR A FIRST TREATY

Aboriginal elder Gary Murray says the process carries a risk of "symbolic genocide"

Australia is the only Commonwealth country never to make a treaty with its indigenous peoples. Why has it proven so difficult? Kathy Marks looks at the vast challenges in Victoria alone - a state that is working towards a national first.

Every school holiday, the train would pick up Daria Atkinson and her four siblings, all aged under 10, and transport them - along with thousands of other Aboriginal children from the countryside - to Melbourne, where they would spend up to two months living with a white family.

"We had to call the adults mum and dad," recalls Ms Atkinson, now 56.

"We were told how to sit at the table, how to eat properly. We weren't allowed to get dirty. We had to forget we were Aboriginal. But at least we got to go home - the Stolen Generations didn't."

Having experienced first-hand one of Australia's misguided assimilation programs, Ms Atkinson now works with members of the Stolen Generations in Victoria - people who were permanently separated from their families.

Many of them are still trying to reconnect with their community, culture and traditional country.

The quest has acquired a new urgency as Victoria paves the way for treaty discussions with the state's Aboriginal population - the first Australian jurisdiction to seek a formal agreement with its original inhabitants.

What is a treaty in this context?

A formal agreement that can redefine the relationship between a government and indigenous peoples

For many indigenous Australians, recognition of their sovereignty and right to self-determination is a priority

A treaty can acknowledge and apologise for past wrongs, and establish a "truth-telling" process

It can include compensation for land and resources lost during colonisation

It can set out practical agreements on health, education, jobs and land use

Multiple treaties, with different groups, are a likely outcome

Next year will see the creation of a statutory Aboriginal Representative Body intended to be the voice of indigenous Victoria, which will hammer out ground rules for treaty negotiations in conjunction with the state government.

It has taken nearly three years of sometimes acrimonious consultations and more than $37m Australian dollars (£21m; $27m) of public funds just to get to this point.

Now controversy surrounds the representative body, where - under an official model - 11 of the 28 seats would be reserved for officially acknowledged "language nations" which occupied particular regions before European settlement.

There were, however, 38 such nations before colonisation.

The state of Victoria alone has 38 "language nations"

"So the other 27 will have to fight over the leftovers," says Gary Murray, an Aboriginal elder, referring to the remaining 17 seats, to be decided via an election of all Aboriginal residents. "And that's discriminatory."

Also potentially problematic is that only "traditional owners" - proven descendants of a language nation or clan (extended family) - will be eligible to stand in the election, or participate in eventual treaty talks, or share in benefits flowing from a treaty.

That means that some of the "stolen" people could be, in a significant way, excluded from the treaty process - a process that indigenous Australians have been demanding for decades, and which they hope will deliver them social justice and economic self-sufficiency while helping to heal the wounds of the past.

Meanwhile, there is a more immediate issue: a state election this Saturday, which could lead to the process being junked, if the Labor government of Premier Daniel Andrews loses power.

In South Australia, the conservative Liberal government abandoned treaty negotiations with three Aboriginal nations after winning an election in March.

The Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, is opposed to a state-based treaty, arguing that "a national approach would be a much better way to go".

Australia is the only Commonwealth country yet to conclude a treaty with its First Nations, although the subject has been debated on and off for years. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke promised a treaty in 1988.

Bob Hawke receives the Barunga Statement, a landmark document, in 1988 - prompting his pledge for a treaty

With progress stalled at the federal level, several states and territories have embarked on their own treaty process. First off the block, in February 2016, was Victoria - where Mr Andrews' government has discovered how protracted and tortuous the process can be, even for just one state.

"It's mind-blowing, the amount of work that has gone into this to date," says Janine Coombs, one of the traditional owners on the Aboriginal Treaty Working Group, which advises the Victorian Treaty Advancement Commissioner.

That work has included four state-wide forums, dozens of regional community consultations and "roadshows", a six-day "community assembly" in Melbourne, and legislation enshrining the route to treaty talks, which the government hopes would discourage an incoming Liberal administration from jettisoning the process.

The election for the representative body, to take place across six voting regions, has thrown up multiple challenges. Should, for instance, traditional owners from interstate, now living in Victoria, be able to stand?

What about indigenous Victorians living elsewhere - in some cases just across the Murray River, which forms a boundary with New South Wales?

And how will the vexed question of who is eligible to vote - who is, in fact, Aboriginal - be settled?

In Tasmania, in the early 2000s, bitter legal battles were fought over this issue, with the dominant Aboriginal community challenging the right of more than 1,000 people to vote in elections for an Aboriginal statutory authority.

The difficulties involved in setting up a representative body in Victoria - in unifying all the disparate Aboriginal voices - are a legacy of the state's colonial history, which saw indigenous groups pushed off their land and dispersed to distant missions and reserves.

Policies which later created the Stolen Generations severed yet more links with family, community and territory, resulting in a small, fragmented population which today numbers about 50,000.

As in other southern states which were swiftly and brutally settled, most Aboriginal Victorians have mixed ancestry.

Model criticised as 'symbolic genocide'

The proposed model for the representative body, Ms Coombs believes, is the "fairest and most inclusive possible", with additional seats to be made available as more language nations complete a formal recognition process.

Mr Murray, though, says that not giving automatic representation to all 38 nations is "offensive, repugnant and symbolic genocide". And he warns that if the model is not amended, he and other vocal opponents will lodge complaints with state and national anti-discrimination authorities.

Treaty negotiations could still be years off, but they promise to be extraordinarily complex, with up to 100 different clan groups seeking separate treaties and, in some cases, disputing each other's territorial boundaries and ancestry.

Nonetheless, some hope the Victorian process could kick-start a momentum that will lead to a federal treaty.

Ms Coombs says: "This isn't a sprint; it's a marathon. The here and now is about setting the foundations and structures right, so that my grandsons and the next seven generations will get the outcomes and benefits.

"Because this opportunity may never come around again."

AMERICANS FIND MEANING IN MONEY MORE THAN FRIENDS OR RELIGION



As Americans gather with their family and friends for Thanksgiving dinner, they're being fed some grim home truths from the Pew Research Centre.

Asked to rate what gave their life meaning, researchers found more people mentioned career and money, than friends or religion.

Two-thirds of those surveyed said family was a source of satisfaction.

But close to a third also cited work, while 23% said their finances made their lives meaningful.

Researchers conducted the survey late last year, asking nearly 5,000 Americans an open-ended question about what parts of their lives gave them satisfaction and fulfilment. Answers included pets, hobbies, grandchildren and travel.

Where Americans find meaning in life

Family 69%

Career 34%

Money 23%

Faith and spirituality 20%

Friends 19%

Activities and hobbies 19%

Health 16%

The open-ended question about what made people feel fulfilled received a wide variety of responses.

"Building a scale model trebuchet out of discarded lumber. I can do it, I know I can," said one.

"Family, God, friends, guns, work... in that order," said another.

There were also touching anecdotes: "I guess what keeps me going is the surprising acts of kindness I see everyday in this city. A kid dropped and broke his toy on the train during rush hour and had a meltdown. Strangers grabbed the pieces and worked together to snap it back together."

Another respondent was focused on earning: "With lots of money from the job I'm majoring in, I'll be able to finally enjoy life and its full benefits, instead of standing on the sidelines while the rich take pleasure in a life they were born into."

While others discussed things they couldn't afford: "I miss the ability to work. I miss buying clothes I want, going to coffee shops and having money for a good dinner at a fine dining restaurant."

A second parallel survey conducted by Pew provided 15 defined categories and asked respondents to rate the importance of those pre-set options.

In the second survey using the closed-ended question, family was again the most popular rated source of meaning. But it was followed by being outdoors, spending time with friends and caring for pets, which were deemed to give "a great deal of meaning" to more than 40% of those surveyed.

Religious faith ranked lower, providing a "great deal" of meaning to just 36% of people, on par with reading. In that survey only 34% of respondents ranked career as giving the highest level of meaning in their lives.

MARK HOPPUS ON THE RECORDS THAT CHANGED HIS LIFE

Before Blink-182’s Las Vegas Residency at the Palms wrapped, Daniel P Carter headed out to America to sit down with Mark Hoppus for ‘Music Ruined My Life’.

Mark took us on the journey of his musical upbringing on Radio 1's Rock Show, from buying his first cassette to christening the Walkman he got for his tenth birthday, to having explosive diarrhoea in front of The Cure's Robert Smith some 22 years later. Let’s be honest, it wouldn’t be a true Blink-182 anecdote without some sort of bodily fluid getting a mention…

Here’s what we learnt on ‘Music Ruined My Life’ with Blink-182 frontman Mark Hoppus.

1 | The first album he bought… Michael Jackson’s Thriller

Before discovering his own music, Mark's father introduced him to The Beatles, Billy Joel and Elton John (not a bad haul), but when Mark was given some money for his tenth birthday it was a Michael Jackson record that he went out and got (again, not bad for a 10 year old).

“I think it was my tenth birthday and I got money from one of my grandparents. I bought it on cassette for my brand new Walkman, which was my big birthday present that year. I felt really spoilt as a 10 year old to have a Walkman.”

“I remember when the video for that song came out. It was a huge deal, and it premiered, I think, on HBO in the United States, and they had the making of beforehand and John Landis directed the video. It was this big thing that a music video was actually longer than the song - it was like a short movie. So that formed the foundation of my music collection.”

2 | The album that changed his life… The Descendants’ I Don’t Wanna Grow up

It's no secret that The Descendants inspired all the members of Blink-182 (past and present), but Mark said it was Silly Girl that changed his view on the punk rock forever.

“When I heard Silly Girl it changed everything that I thought punk rock was or could be. All the punk rock I heard before that was really political, angry and screamy, and it didn’t click with me at all.”

“Then I heard Silly Girl - it was like a punk rock Beach Boys - you could sing along to it, it had great melodies, great harmonies, and it was about a girl. Then I wanted to hear everything I could by the Descendants, then from there I got into Bad Religion, then from there I got into Sonic Youth... and then my brain blew up and I was 15."

3 | The first band he saw live… They Might Be Giants

Dressed head to toe in black, Mark and a group of his teenage friends headed to the 9:30 club in Washington DC to see alt-rock band They Might Be Giants while they were touring The Pink Album in 1988.

“In the March of 1988, I went to see They Might Be Giants at the original 9:30 Club, and it was the first time that I smoked a cigarette.”

“We were just these 15 year old kids, turning 16, and we decided we wanted to smoke to look cool, so we bought bought a box of cigarettes from the cigarette machine and sat at a booth. We must have just looked so laughable."

ANDAMANS: US MAN'S DEATH PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON 'TRIBAL TOURISM'

Andaman is home to five "particularly vulnerable" tribes including the Jarawas and North Sentinelese

The killing of an American national by members of an endangered tribe in the Andaman islands off India's east coast has renewed concerns over the surreptitious practice of "tribal tourism" in the archipelago, Omkar Khandekar writes.

The indigenous islanders of North Sentinel, among the last of the "uncontacted" tribes in the world, killed 27-year-old John Allen Chau with arrows when he went to their island last week.

Police said that Chau had paid 25,000 rupees ($354; £275) to six local fishermen to take him to North Sentinel. Media reports suggested he wanted to introduce the islanders to Christianity.

Andaman is home to five "particularly vulnerable" tribes. They are the Jarawas, North Sentinelese, Great Andamanese, Onge and Shompen. The Jarawas and the North Sentinelese haven't integrated with the mainstream population yet. This makes them a source of intrigue for many of the 500,000 tourists who visit the islands every year.

Earlier this year, the Ministry of Home Affairs passed a notification exempting foreign nationals from having to acquire restricted area permits (RAP) to visit 29 islands in the archipelago.

The list includes nine islands in Nicobar and two in Andaman, occupied by tribal and indigenous communities considered "particularly vulnerable". Among them was also North Sentinel island.

But authorities insist tourists will still have to obtain permission from the district authority and the forest department to do so.

To see the Jarawas, many tourists take a two-hour bus ride that cuts through the Jarawa reserves

The Jarawas live in a 1,028km forest reserve between the south and middle Andamans.

To see them, many tourists take a two-hour bus ride from Andaman's capital Port Blair to Baratang which is home to limestone caves and mud volcanoes. To do so, they travel on the Andaman Trunk Road (ATR) which cuts through the Jarawa reserves.

In 2013, the Supreme Court banned tourists from taking the ATR after a video shot by a journalist showed policemen forcing six Jarawa women to dance for tourists. The court reversed the decision after the state administration submitted a notification promising that no tourist or commercial establishment in the area would be permitted.

"The administration has long prioritised the livelihood of the locals," says Manish Chandi from the Andaman Nicobar Environment Team, who has been studying the islands for the past 18 years.

"After the court's ruling, it set up a ferry to Baratang island from Port Blair. It was a clever move. If questioned, they could always say it has made an alternative to the road available and the choice now rests on the tourists. But invariably, tourists 'choose' the road."

There is no direct connection to the North Sentinel islands, which are located 50km west of the capital Port Blair. There is also frequent patrolling by the coastguard to keep intrepid travellers at bay. And yet, says Mr Chandi, people keep attempting to see the North Sentinelese - often by bribing local fishermen.

"In 2013-14, a Mumbai-based businessman on a sports fishing boat was caught by the coastguard looking at the North Sentinelese," says Mr Chandi.

The Jarawas live in a 1,028km forest reserve between the south and middle Andamans

"Often, yachts carrying foreign tourists pass by the islands. But most are deterred by the coastguard patrol and make sure they don't lurk around."

Officials from the Department of Forest and Wildlife didn't respond to phone calls by the BBC. But Govind Ram, director of the Department of Tribal Welfare in the islands, indicates he is aware of the instances of tribal tourism.

"It's true that people have a fascination to see the tribal community," he says. "We have made all arrangements to restrict this from happening. There's regular patrolling by the police and officials from the tribal welfare department."

But given the size of the areas meant to be patrolled, he adds, "there is a chance that miscreants can enter".

And despite official insistence that foreigners will still need to obtain permission from the district authority and the forest department to visit Jarawa reserves and North Sentinel, conservationists say the scrapping of restricted area permits for these islands sends a signal that they will eventually be opened for tourism.

 Indian coastguard/Survival InternationalThe Sentinelese have always resisted outside contact

"The decision was taken unilaterally, without any consultation with local stakeholders," said Denis Giles, editor of the local newspaper Andaman Chronicles. "Instead of taking measures that might lead to tribal tourism, the government needs to continue with the 'hands off, eyes on' policy it has practised so far."

Earlier this month, the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes said the relaxation needed to be "reconsidered".

Despite its widespread practice and extensive documentation by groups like Survival International, which works for tribal peoples' rights, two major tour operators the BBC spoke to denied any instance of tribal tourism in the islands.

"I have never had anyone inquire about tribal tourism," said M Vinod, the president of the Andaman Association of Tour Operators, which represents 102 of 176 registered tourism firms in the islands.

"Police security is high and movements are strictly regulated while passing through tribal reserves."

The killing of the US national, he adds, was only a case of a "security lapse".

"The relaxation of RAPs is a good move for tourism," he says. And his stand on including islands like North Sentinel?

"It's up to the government to decide which islands it wants to promote."

MATTHEW WRIGHT SAYS THE WRIGHT STUFF GAVE HIM PTSD

Wright presented The Wright Stuff from 2000 to 2018

Matthew Wright has revealed the stress of presenting his long-running Channel 5 show left him with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Speaking to The Sun, the broadcaster said he was recently told by a doctor that his sleepless nights were a sign he had the anxiety disorder.

Wright presented The Wright Stuff for 18 years before leaving in June.

"If I hadn't got out, or left when I did, I don't know what kind of state I'd be in today," he said.

"If I had carried on I do think it would have impacted me and my family."

Wright said that initially, he "thought maybe it's just because I'm used to waking up early in the morning, but the doctor said 'no, it is a sign of post-traumatic stress'".

The TV presenter said he had suffered a number of setbacks during his time on the show, among them the collapse of his first marriage and the death of his nephew.

Yet he said doing his daily morning show had been "quite therapeutic" as it was better than "sitting at home feeling beaten by things".

The situation changed, he said, when The Wright Stuff was taken over by ITN, which he claimed had difficulty "meeting the standards he was used to".

"That put loads more pressure on me and it started to impact my mental health," he said. "I am still suffering to some degree the consequences of that."

Jeremy Vine now hosts the programme formerly known as The Wright Stuff, which ITN took over in 2017.

BBC News has invited ITN to respond to Wright's comments.

Matthew Wright with wife Amelia, who is expecting a baby

Wright is not the only celebrity to claim to have suffered from or be diagnosed with PTSD, a condition which the NHS says is "caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events."

Fellow broadcaster Richard Bacon recently revealed he experienced PTSD when he revisited the hospital where he was put in a medical coma after being taken ill on a flight.

Actress Keira Knightley is another to say she was diagnosed with the disorder as she struggled to cope with her sudden rise to fame.

"Any situation that a person finds traumatic can cause PTSD," the NHS states on its website, saying those afflicted "may have problems sleeping."

According to one medical expert, though, the term is often used in circumstances where different terminology might be more appropriate.

"Although a rigorous work schedule may induce stress and anxiety and sleepless nights, it wouldn't normally be typical of PTSD," said consultant clinical psychologist Dr Brock Chisholm.

"I do not wish to comment on any particular person and have no knowledge of Matthew Wright," he said.

"A rigorous work schedule can induce stress and burnout, which are debilitating things themselves but not the same as PTSD."

Dr Chisholm, a co-founder of the charity Trauma Treatment International, expressed a concern that "people are widely identifying as having PTSD when they probably don't".

"They may be very stressed and have all kinds of equally impactful stress conditions, but it's often a term that's used when it doesn't actually apply," he told the BBC.
