HOW TO TIE THE MOST POPULAR TIE KNOTS

So you need to knot up. Don't worry, you've come to the right place. Right here you'll find clear illustrations and simple directions that make learning how to tie any kind of tie knot easy. Choose from popular knots like the Windsor, the four in hand, or the simple knot—even the self-tied bow tie.



Just take a look below and start practicing in front of the mirror.

A classic knot, and one of the most common, this knot is a favorite of style icons like Sean Connery's James Bond and Tom Ford. Wear it with a more traditionally tailored, non-skinny suit and tie combo. It's also a good knot to use with a spread collar.



Unless you are an English soccer player, this is a knot generally worn in a more formal setting. Something that would require a morning suit and a butterfly collar..



Slender without being skinny, the four in hand is the knot most commonly used. It's also quite a bit simpler than the Windsor knots and will look good in basically every non-tuxedo situation.



The simple knot is exactly that: simple. It's the way to go if you want a really small knot, sort of a 1940s style. And it's also the knot to use with a skinny tie. Just keep in mind, if you wear a skinny tie, make sure to wear a skinny suit. You shouldn't have a lapel width thicker than two inches at the absolute most.

Bow ties are actually not that hard to tie, and self-tied look a hell of a lot better than pre-tied. Especially if you're wearing it with a tux. Put it this way: James Bond wouldn't go near a pre-tied bow tie, and who in this world looks better in a tux?

THE BEST DRONE PHOTOS OF 2015

Drones aren't just used for fishing, warfare, and target practice. As the remote control flying machines grow in popularity, so does the amount of jaw-dropping aerial imagery being produced.

"There literally are no physical limits as to where a shot can take place anymore," said Eric Dupin, CEO of Dronestagram, a website and app focused exclusively on drone imagery.



As we look ahead to 2016 (and the mandatory registration of drones with the FAA), we revisit some of the best drone-made images from 2015, as compiled by Dronestagram.

DIEGO LUNA KNOWS MEXICO'S DRUG WAR HISTORY IS UGLY, BUT IT MUST BE TOLD

When we last left the world of Narcos—our world—we witnessed DEA agent Javier Peña (played with potent world-weariness by Pedro Pascal) hanging up his crime-fighting boots for good. He had plenty of reasons to take a bow; Pablo Escobar was dead, the Medellín and Cali Cartels had been vanquished, and Colombia's cocaine empire had gone to dust. But there's no feeling of victory, no sunset ride for a hero agent—only the quiet resignation that the so-called "drug war" he'd been fighting was a never ending one, in part because his own bosses in the United States government seemingly had no interest in ending it.



That sense of futility is palpable throughout Narcos: Mexico, now streaming on Netflix, which pulls the show's timeline all the way back to 1980 to illustrate how it all began. Diego Luna stars as Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, founder of the Guadalajara Cartel and the former boss of a guy you may have seen in the news lately. Chasing him is Enrique "Kiki" Camarena (Michael Peña), a DEA agent at a time when, as the show points out, there were more female officers in the NYPD than agents in the DEA. As their paths intersect, the real beneficiaries of the narco underworld—on both sides of the border—come into better focus.

It's the series' most biting season yet. And for Luna, who was born and raised in Mexico, the story is an ugly, but important one.

"We have to talk about this period of time," he tells me. "It’s crucial to understand why we’re reading what we are reading today."

Luna talked to Esquire about playing the "Rockefeller of Marijuana," how drugs and violence have reshaped his country, and what needs to be done to fix it.

He was initially reluctant to accept the role.

It's one of those times where my first impulse as an actor is to say no. Let's get out of this, let's escape as soon as possible before they even work out a deal. I've seen many efforts of telling the story of these people and failing badly. You have an even bigger responsibility, because behind these stories there is a lot of loss, and pain. You’re talking about people that lived this 30 years ago—it’s not that long, you know? But [showrunner Eric Newman] said to me, "Your voice is important." And when I realized that, and that I was going to have a chance to actually be involved in what we were doing and the story we were telling and its importance, I said "Okay, okay, I'll join."



Carlos Somonte/Netflix

Finding information about Félix Gallardo was not easy.

Growing up in Mexico, you have Caro Quintero, you have Amado Carrillo, you have El Chapo, all these names, these characters that people think they know better than anyone. [Gallardo] was much more of this discrete guy ... He understood the value of discretion. It was kind of cool to actually have to go back and do research to find out exactly who he was.

He sees his character as another victim in the drug war.

To me the most important part to recreate a character is to think about the context he was living in, and try to understand. It's very important to not talk about things as if they were black and white, that rhetoric is getting us to a very polarized world. No one is just "bad"—love, jealousy, ambition, regret, all those things are there, and they have reasons, you may not agree with them, but as an actor you have to understand those reasons in order to portray a character. You also understand that in this show, the lead is not Kiki Camarena, I'm not the lead, the lead in this story is cocaine, and how cocaine gets to you, and the system created here. They are victims of this system.





Carlos Somonte/Netflix

He blames militarization for making the violence in Mexico worse.

The big part of recreating Mexico in the 80s is the sadness that comes to me, remembering how free the Mexico that I grew up in was, and how it is not the Mexico my kids are growing up in. It has changed because of this violence, because how long this violence has been ramping up, and in the last 12 years since [former Mexican president] Felipe Calderón decided to have a frontal war with drug trafficking in Mexico. Things just got out of control because there was no strategy behind it, and it's clearly a war we are all losing. It makes me very sad to have to accept that that is my country.

Drugs need to be treated as a matter of public health.

We think, "Oh, the drug dealers are violent because they are putting drugs in our pockets." No, it's the other way around. The battle is over demand. There's a gigantic market around the world—in the States, probably the biggest—and the moment there is a market, there is going to be a supplier. We have to see this as a health issue. And as soon as we start talking about demand, we can start accepting that it is an issue that belongs to all of us because the market is everywhere. If we don't try to fix it together, it will never get fixed.

Given our current border tension, this season is especially important now.

One thing to me that is clear is that there are criminals participating on both sides. And we have to accept that. We have to accept, for this structure to exist, every level of power is involved, and this corruption has got to both sides of the border. I wish when the series ends, people will start to ask themselves, "Why are young kids in countries like Mexico willing to join these organizations?" What pushes them there, you know? Because if we start analyzing the issue from a different perspective, we are part of the issue.

WHY PHOTOGRAPHER RUSSELL JAMES DECIDED TO DO HIS NEW ANGELS BOOK

Four years after his fine art collection Angels debuted to acclaim, famed Victoria's Secret photographer Russell James is back with a follow-up collector's edition. But the world this Angels project—a stunning ode to the female form, featuring Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Bella Hadid, Cindy Crawford, and dozens more—releases into is far different than the one that welcomed the book in 2014, as the #MeToo movement has been mobilized.



"I started to ask myself, am I tone deaf? Should I even be doing a project like this?" James admits. "But as I talked to some of the girls, they were like, to not do it, for them, felt like the opposite of what the social narrative was. They said, this is about us choosing when we'd like to do it, what kind of project we'd like to do it for. Especially Kendall [Jenner] and Cindy [Crawford, who also wrote the book's foreword] said, 'If I'm going to do something like this, I want to do it for art—something that feels good to me and not necessarily for selling a product.'"

Crawford's writing reiterates James' points: "Feeling safe with Russell is a testament to who he is as a photographer. He photographs women as beautiful and sexy, but never in a way that feels lascivious. Russell is the exact opposite of a guy trying to get you naked…yet, somehow, he manages to do just that. Maybe it’s the charm of his Australian accent, the spark in his blue eyes, or the casualness of his ever-present flip-flops, but he effortlessly manages to walk that fine line.”



The massive scale of the project meant it took over four years to complete.

"It was actually the first time I'd gone about doing a curated point of view on one subject," says James. "It was 2014 when I started it and then I had to be opportunistic about when the talent was available and when I had the right resources. I was shooting almost up to the day that I did the exhibition [in New York in September] and announced the book."

He embraced collaboration.

James wanted the women to plan the shoots, as much as they wanted: "The second time Elsa Hosk and I shot, in the city in Manhattan, I had a studio full of props and toys and she went about constructing everything from the hair to the waist to the shoe. It was fun to be a part of it."

Elsa Hosk RUSSELL JAMES

Cindy Crawford makes him as nervous as she makes you.

"We actually shot twice," James says. "I [originally] shot Cindy and I had a lot of styling. I was probably being overly conservative." He adds, "I'm a little intimidated by Cindy because she's an icon. All bow down to Cindy. But as I was about to publish [the original shoot], we had a conversation and I said, 'What if we shot again?' And she was like, 'What about a sheet?' I thought that was genius—and extremely confident."

Kendall Jenner's shoot was the most challenging, but not for reasons you'd expect.

"If there's Kendall Jenner, you're going to the beach, and there's nude scenes involved, you face incredible challenges," says James. Jenner's omni-present tail of paparazzi, of course, presented the main hurdle. "There were shots that I wanted to do of her where she would climb up to the top of this incredible tree that was on the coast—but how the heck do I do that and not get compromised? I was trying to do one of the most open shoots with one of the people that was under the most intense sort of scrutiny. [But] I showed her and she was like, 'Get me up there. I'll do the shot.'"





He got the luckiest with Sara Sampaio.

"It was just a matter of perfect timing," James says of his shoot in St. Barts with the 27-year-old Portuguese model. There was perfect blue water, perfect blue sky. She was at the right place at the right time, so there was that kind of opportunity to get photographs that I don't think I could have planned for a year and actually pulled it off."

Sara Sampaio RUSSELL JAMES

And having Candice Swanepoel on the cover was a victory for both James and the supermodel.

Swanepoel has given birth to two children in the last two years, and the Internet hasn't always been kind to the 30-year-old regarding her body. James wanted to celebrate the phase of life she's entered: "I shot her four weeks after the birth of her second child," James says. "[She] is the ultimate hippie and just a beautiful soul. And, literally, I've had instances in my career where I took photographs of Candice in swimwear and then we had people saying 'you shouldn't retouch the women to look like that because it's unattainable'—which I entirely agree with—and I've gone back to the photograph and there's not not a bit of retouch on her. Sometimes Mother Nature just does what she does."



Respect is the foundation he built his career on from the beginning.

"The net sum of it all," he explains, "is regardless whether I'm shooting nudes or I'm shooting a person fully clothed just as a portrait, I've always wanted them to feel comfortable." The results are better, as well, that way, he says: "I get the best pictures when people feel comfortable. I mean, I even ask people what music they'd like to have on. You want people to really embrace what you publish. I want them to feel a part of it as much as I was."

THAT WISCONSIN SCHOOL DISTRICT WON'T PUNISH ITS NAZI-SALUTING TEENS

Remember the boys from Baraboo High School's class 0f 2019, the Wisconsin teens who were so unambiguously throwing up Nazi salutes? Well, their school district has been weighing its options as to how to respond to the controversy, and seems to have settled upon doing nothing at all.

Superintendent Lori Mueller sent a letter to district parents Wednesday in which she explained that the First Amendment right to free speech made it difficult for the district to punish their students. Mueller reportedly noted that it’s impossible to know the “intentions in the hearts of those who were involved.”



This is utter bullshit. If schools can punish students for saying “bullshit,” they can punish them for a Nazi salute https://t.co/h2U2ggu8oh — Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) November 24, 2018

Reporter Jules Suzdaltsev, who interviewed Baraboo students in the wake of the controversy, pointed out that Wisconsin last year implemented a policy that automatically expels or suspend students who protest at campus events. That pretty much flies in the face of the free speech defense Baraboo schools offered.

PETE DAVIDSON GOT A RUTH BADER GINSBURG TATTOO

Pete Davidson learned his lesson after rushing into the matching tattoo stage of romance with former fiancée Ariana Grande. With his latest ink, he's decided to honor a lady that he (and the rest of the world) will surely love forever: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Ginsburg.



This isn’t the first time that Davidson’s gotten a tattoo honoring one of his political idols. Last year, he memorialized 90s-era Hillary Clinton with some prime leg real estate. Clinton appreciated the gesture, and posted a comment responding to Davidson's Instagram post that read, "Thanks, @petedavidson. This makes it significantly less awkward that I’ve had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years."

Hillary Clinton responded to Pete Davidson’s tattoo of her face and I think Pete’s dead now. pic.twitter.com/Bisq3wKMSv — Jillian Sederholm (@JillianSed) December 16, 2017

Just last week, Davidson paid tribute to Ginsburg on Saturday Night Live. The 85-year-old justice had just fractured three ribs in a fall, and Davidson joined fellow cast member Chris Redd in a rap video in which they pledged to "ride for Ginsburg." At the end of the song, Redd instructed Davidson to "tell ‘em your favorite RBG decision," to which a shamefaced Davidson replied, "I don’t know."

BOB DYLAN DRANK WHISKEY AND TOOK IN THE CIRCUS ON THE TONIGHT SHOW

Bob Dylan clearly feels very strongly about his whiskey line. He raved about it to The New York Times earlier this year, releasing a statement saying, "This is great whiskey." He took his reticence even further Thursday, appearing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to hawk his hooch without saying a single word.



In the segment, Dylan and Fallon take in a performance by The Big Apple Circus while sipping Dylan's Heaven's Door whiskey. It's all set to the tune of Erik Satie's Gymnopedie No. 1, also known as that song you learn during your second and final year of piano lessons. In the end, Dylan disappears—his appearance apparently a whiskey and acrobatics-fueled fever dream on Fallon's part. Maybe the late-night ad will help Heaven's Door raise enough cash to fight that lawsuit.

I'M THANKFUL FOR MEMORIES, GOOD AND BAD, AND THE COMMON HISTORY THEY COMPRISE

Thanksgiving Day became a habit, for the reason that in the course of time, as the years drifted on, it was perceived that the exterminating had ceased to be mutual and was all on the white man's side, consequently on the Lord's side; hence it was proper to thank the Lord for it and extend the usual annual compliments. —Mark Twain



It is altogether a day of memory, and not all the memories are good ones, and if we're true to ourselves and our heritage, we admit that in our hearts even before cranberry salad gets passed. The epigraph that David Remnick chose for Lenin's Tomb, his essential account of the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of whatever it is that came after, is a now-famous quote from Czech novelist Milan Kundera:

The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.

The original occupants of this continent didn't have to be told that. Thousands of years of traditions, religious and otherwise, embedded the truth of it in their minds and in the character of their people. They held onto it even while being crushed by a new nation dedicated to reinvention and second chances—for white people, anyway.

The Pilgrims came here for a second chance. So did the Puritans, and they built their shining city on the hill in Boston and then set about constructing a vicious theocracy that hung Quakers, persecuted Catholics, and ran Roger Williams all the way to Rhode Island. Slaves fought to keep their memories alive as a way to keep their families together when they were no longer intact. And so did wave after wave of immigrants who, remembering what they'd fled—For the Irish, famine. For the Germans, failed revolution. For Jews, pogroms and persecution. And today, for the Hondurans, gang violence and civil war—helped them build new lives in a new place.



And the Native people, pushed and crowded and eventually ground up in the wheels on endless reinvention, remembered what had happened to them and why. And, in November, two Native American women were elected to serve in the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States, and their memories will come with them as they help to write the laws for the country that slaughtered their ancestors.

Sharice Davids, left, celebrates with her mother, Crystal Herriage, after defeating incumbent Kevin Yoder to become one of the first two Native American women to be elected to Congress. Getty Images Whitney Curtis

So, this Thanksgiving, I'm thankful for memories, good and bad, and for the common history they comprise, good and bad, peaceful and bloody. They are the best weapons against a politics gone mad and a president* gone mad with it. We find even our collective short-term memory overwhelmed by events, day after day. The president*'s main refuge is the constant present tense, and it is a redoubtable one. But it's not an impregnable one. The arsenal of history, individual and collective, is becoming arrayed against it, and that arsenal's primary weapon is our memory, of who we are and what we were, so we can define whom we want to become. It is still there, waiting to be used, and I give thanks for that.

And I give thanks for all here at the shebeen. Have a great holiday. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line, and remember, always remember, even when the wide world tells you it's futile.

SUPREME'S FAMOUS BOX LOGO IS OFFICIALLY THE MOST POWERFUL IN THE WORLD

A new report has declared Supreme to be the lucky brand with the most powerful logo in the world. That's right: The box logo that launched a million lineups and no small share of controversy (considering it's, um, inspired by the work of artist Barbara Kruger) is now number one on the planet.



This is all, as Hypebeast reports, according to the shopping powerhouse Lyst (with a "y"), which compiles a list (with an "i") known as The Lyst Index. It takes the data compiled from analyzing Lyst's 5 million monthly shoppers to figure out who fashion's major players are at the moment.

And right now, the most powerful of the current logo-driven climate is NYC-based Supreme. High-fashion houses like Gucci and Fendi also made the top 10, as well as more democratic brands like Champion, fueled in large part by carefully chosen collaborations.

Here's the full rundown.

COPY EDDIE REDMAYNE'S SMART AIRPORT STYLE WHEN YOU'RE CAUGHT IN TRAVEL HELL THIS THANKSGIVING

We're gearing up for one of the busiest travel weeks of the year, which, frankly, kind of sucks. Soul-crushing crowds, airport delays, not enough room in your luggage for all those coats you want to wear—the list of complaints is almost as long as the line for check-in. Luckily, Eddie Redmayne is here to soothe your worries with some super-sharp airport style.

The Fantastic Beasts actor just wrapped up the press tour for the series' latest installment, The Crimes of Grindelwald, along with his fellow actors and bold af style stars. This weekend, hauling seemingly every single outfit from said tour in his staggering luggage collection, he touched down at LAX in an easy-to-emulate look you should definitely steal.

The base components here are good—white tee, slim black chinos, boots—but what sets everything off is that camo jacket. It's eye-catching, but doesn't scream for attention. Cool enough to be the star of the show, but not so crazy you can't wear it with a few different outfits over the course of a trip. Here are a couple you can grab right now, whether you're looking for an investment piece from a high-fashion house or something classically English (just like Eddie!).

SWATCH, DISNEY, AND DAMIEN HIRST ARE CELEBRATING MICKEY’S 90TH BIRTHDAY IN STYLE

Along with a slew of fall collaborations timed to celebrate the 90th birthday of Mickey Mouse (some, frankly, rather better than others), Disney has worked with Swatch to produce arguably the most immediately covetable collab of the lot: a quartz-driven Mickey watch with an almighty difference.

While Swatch might have very credibly updated the classic Mickey Mouse watch first produced by Ingersoll in 1933 on its own, this is actually a three-way tie-up. The third partner, who brings a lot to the table, is the one-time enfant terrible of the Brit Art scene, Damien Hirst. In terms of collectability, Hirst’s involvement makes this release a collab of a very different order. Both editions bear Hirst's signature on the strap's underside.

One edition, called Mirror Spot Mickey—it has a mirrored dial—is priced at $125 and launches November 16 in a run of 19,999 pieces. It may sound like a lot, but when these go on sale in Swatch stores worldwide, they'll likely be gone in minutes.

A second, slightly more restrained version with a black dial will sell on Mickey’s official birthday, Sunday, November 18, for just 24 hours, on Swatch's web store—starting at the ungodly hour of 2am EST. It will, we reckon, prove even more of an investment. Priced at $185, the Spot Mickey is limited to just 1,999 pieces. I’m staying up.

MENSCH AT WORK

I will tell you up front (at the risk of making you turn the page, but honesty and humility are in part the subject matter here): This may be the least sexy movie-star profile you will ever read. Because you know that thing where you meet a movie star and right off you bond over taking your high-school-aged kids on college tours? No, I don’t know that thing, either. But it’s what happened when I met Steve Carell this past summer. He had spent much of the year with his seventeen-year-old daughter, visiting prospective schools around the country. I recently went through that process with my own two children. So, as is often the case with middle-aged parents in coastal enclaves, we began lamenting the professionalization of the admissions process, the way so many families now hire test-prep tutors and essay coaches and interview consultants, and the awful stress that puts on kids who, being teenagers, already have enough to worry about without having to deal with the drudgery and anxiety of applying to twenty colleges. (No joke: That’s practically a norm in the 2010s.)

“It’s a science now,” Carell, who is fifty-six, marveled. “It’s very different than when I went to high school. I had a list of, like, four colleges, and I applied and I went to one. I didn’t put that much thought into it.” Me neither, with my three-school lottery back in the mid-1970s. We agreed it was a parent’s job to keep the kids from coming unglued or turning into monstrous, Ivy-seeking missiles, to reassure them that they’ll get in somewhere and that, more likely than not, they’ll have a great time at that somewhere—and if not, they can always transfer.

Sound parental counsel. As I said, this may be the least sexy movie-star profile you will ever read.

To some degree, that is because Carell himself may be the nicest guy in Hollywood, as attested to by two decades’ worth of costars, colleagues, and interlocutors. He has certainly played some of the nicest characters in recent movie history, ranging from the open-hearted title character of The 40-Year-Old Virgin, to the more experienced but still lovelorn single men of a certain age in Dan in Real Life and Crazy, Stupid, Love, to the grief-stricken fathers in last year’s Last Flag Flying and the just-released Beautiful Boy. Even his more “problematic” characters—say, Michael Scott, the doltish boss he portrayed for seven seasons on The Office, or emblematic male chauvinist pig Bobby Riggs in last year’s Battle of the Sexes—offer glimpses of vulnerability that make them likable in a weird-but-he’s-my-cousin way. Add to this roster Gru, the supervillain he’s voiced in the animated Despicable Me movies—a decent chap and an attentive dad. The outlier in this filmography would be John du Pont, the jealous, murderous wrestling patron in 2014’s Foxcatcher, Carell’s first outright drama. The role, for which he wore a startling prosthetic beak, changed many people’s perceptions of what Carell could do and earned him a well-deserved best-actor Oscar nomination. But even du Pont, while grotesque, possessed a recognizable, even tragic humanity; in Carell’s interpretation, you sensed sickness more than evil.

Carell was just getting back to work when we met. He had spent most of 2017 shooting three movies more or less back to back to back, wrapping the last one right before Christmas. He then took off most of 2018—he “just wanted to hang around” with his family—before preparing to dive into this fall’s festival and awards circuit, during which all three of those films, very different from one another but equally ambitious and all based on true stories, will possibly be in contention for various statuettes. In rapid succession you will have the opportunity to see Carell as a father struggling to understand and help his drug-addicted son in Beautiful Boy; as a brain-damaged trauma victim who copes with his emotional wounds by recreating World War II battles with Barbie-like dolls in Robert Zemeckis’s Welcome to Marwen (December 21); and as former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld in Adam McKay’s Dick Cheney biopic, VICE (December 10).

Rumsfeld may seem an unlikely role for Carell, but one thing the two men seem to share is an indifference to the spotlight—an odd trait in actors and politicians alike. Carell might be the least needy performer I’ve ever met. With glasses and a thick but neat beard, and dressed in a navy-blue crewneck sweater over a crisp white shirt, he looked like one of the admissions directors he could have encountered on a college tour; a thoughtful, soft-spoken demeanor added to this impression. “I don’t think I’m a very scintillating conversationalist,” he told me, which is untrue but telling.

Comedians are notoriously—or perhaps stereotypically— driven by childhood scar tissue. But Carell is famous among his peers for keeping that scar tissue, if there is any, deeply hidden. As Jon Stewart, his friend and former boss, told The New Yorker several years ago, “Maybe Steve’s lack of wound is his wound.” Or maybe, decades’ worth of biopics of artists and musicians notwithstanding, being well-adjusted is an asset rather than a hindrance to creativity. (See: Meryl Streep, Paul McCartney.)

At Carell’s suggestion, we met at the Smoke House, a red-banquette restaurant in Burbank that has sat across the street from the Warner Bros, lot for more than seven decades, a sign outside still promising “Fine Food at a Fair Price.” The menu is full of classics such as shrimp Louie and a French-dip sandwich (there’s a prime-rib special on Mondays), and the waiting area is adorned with pictures of now-dead patrons, including Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Steve McQueen, Lee Marvin, and Danny Kaye. Aside from Carell, this noontime’s clientele was decidedly less starry—a pleasant middle-class lunch crowd, mostly locals, a few tourists. The Smoke House is also, coincidentally, where my two sets of grandparents met for the first time, in 1951, following my parents’ engagement. I mentioned this to Carell as we settled into a booth. “I guarantee you, it hasn’t changed at all,” he said. He’s probably right. The restaurant had a slightly dusty, yeasty, beefy aroma reminiscent of 1951, or so I’d imagine. “We come here from time to time,” Carell said. “I kind of like that it hasn’t moved an inch.”

“We” is Carell; his wife, Nancy Carell; their daughter; and their fourteen-year-old son. The restaurant is only a short drive from the family’s home in Toluca Lake, one of the quieter neighborhoods in Los Angeles, a tony but unflashy corner of the San Fernando Valley. “There’s not a lot going on,” Carell said, almost apologetically. “You can go for bike rides with your kids and stuff, so it feels pretty suburban given that we’re in a city.” He added that he and Nancy—who, like him, grew up outside of Boston— naturally gravitated to the Valley when they first moved to L. A., in 1996, and rented a house in Sherman Oaks. “It just felt very neighborhoody, and there wasn’t a lot of pretense, so it was nice.”

Nice place. Nice guy. Fine food. Speaking of which, if Jimmy Stewart hangs on the wall at the Smoke House, I missed him, but he might serve as an old-Hollywood antecedent for Carell: a star who could do both light comedy and drama, and who also projected regular-joe decency. Isn’t Mr. Smith Goes to Washington just a black-and-white precursor, with a filibuster, to The 40-Year-Old Virgin? And if you are a contemporary studio executive who is reading this and thinking of remaking Harvey or It’s a Wonderful Life or Vertigo—well, don’t. If you remain dead set on the idea, though, don’t just assume you’re going to cast Tom Hanks. Am I crazy to think a Rear Window with Carell opposite Amy Adams or Tiffany Haddish might even be kind of good?

But let’s talk about actual Carell movies. Beautiful Boy is adapted from parallel memoirs by father and son David and Nic Sheff— the former a magazine journalist (Rolling Stone, Playboy), the latter a recovering addict turned writer. I admire the film immensely for offering no easy solutions to addiction, and for being brave enough to give the fleeting pleasures of drug abuse their due; it’s a tough watch at times but couldn’t be more germane, with the opioid crisis gutting communities across America. Costarring as Nic, who was hooked on methamphetamines, is Timothee Chalamet, the floppy-haired twenty-two-year-old who broke through last year as a kind of thinking teenager’s heartthrob, playing Saoirse Ronan’s poseur boyfriend in Lady Bird and the lead in the coming-of-age love story Call Me by Your Name, opposite older man Armie Hammer. Chalamet and Carell developed something of a father-son dynamic both off screen and on, as the director, Felix Van Groeningen, had calculated they might. “That Steve is a very devoted family man was very important” in casting him, said Van Groeningen, a Belgian making his first American picture. “Who people are in real life and who the character is obviously don’t have to match, but for this role I wanted the actor who was going to play it to keep it very close, for it to come from a very honest place.” One example: To depict Nic Sheff in the deepest, most strung-out throes of addiction, Chalamet, slender to begin with, went on a controlled diet after the cast had finished a long rehearsal process. According to the actress Maura Tierney—who plays David Sheff’s second wife and Nic’s stepmother—when Chalamet first showed up on set several weeks later, “I remember Steve going, ‘Oh my God, he’s losing weight!’ in a very dadlike way. Their relationship was really like that.” Carell told me that his unfeigned dismay at Chalamet’s appearance that day—“He just looked terrible with the added makeup, like really shockingly bad”—kickstarted one of the film’s most wrenching scenes.

Carell also drew on childhood memories of his own father: “My dad, who is about to turn ninety-three, is a real rock. A real stoic. He didn’t cry a lot, but I could tell when something was tearing him up inside. He internalized it for the sake of the family. And that to me was more heartbreaking than someone who would just, you know, be really outward with his emotions. It’s kind of how I interpreted the David character: He’s trying to keep it together.” Wrestling with the limits of David’s love for his son, its impotence in the face of Nic’s addiction—the film has a distinctly un-Hollywood message, that love sometimes isn’t all you need—Carell does some of the best, most controlled acting of his career, often without words. You can see the resignation in his body as he takes down a picture of Nic from a wall in his study; and the tentativeness, in the final scene, with which he puts an arm around Chalamet’s shoulder—a broken bond beginning to mend. If you are like me, at that moment you may get teary, and you may even forgive the movie for scoring an earlier scene with “Sunrise, Sunset,” that schmaltzy Fiddler on the Roof bar and bat mitzvah perennial. (“Is this the little girl I carried . . .”)

So much talk of fathers and children made me curious: Are Carell’s kids Carell fans? Do they watch his movies and binge seasons of The Office? Or does he try to keep them away from all that? “They keep themselves away,” he said, laughing. “I’m just a dad to them. They obviously know what I do, but we don’t put a lot of value on that. From time to time, they’ll check out my stuff, and they hear about it at school a little bit. But it’s just my job.” (I suppose I might have avoided The 40-Year-Old Virgin, too, if it had starred my dad.)

The stoic father Carell mentioned was a businessman and an electrical engineer; his mother was a psychiatric nurse. He grew up in Acton, Massachusetts, as the youngest of four brothers. He did some acting in high school and in college, at Denison, from which he graduated in 1984 with a double major in history and theater. But he never really thought of himself as a performer, or of acting as a possible career, until he was applying to law school like any other liberal-arts major unsure what to do with himself. Indeed, he evinced so little enthusiasm for attending law school—he got stuck on the question, on one of the applications, “Why do you want to be an attorney?”—that his parents suggested he “name something you’ve always enjoyed.” The answer, Carell realized, was acting. He eventually moved to Chicago, figuring it would be more hospitable for a raw young performer than cutthroat New York or Los Angeles. He was right, or at least Chicago was right for him, and he began getting small parts in shows and commercials. (On YouTube, you can catch him in a 1989 ad for Brown’s Chicken: “While we’ve always cooked our chicken in cholesterol-free cottonseed oil, we now have cholesterol-free batter, too!”) In 1987, he joined the legendary improv institution Second City, at which he overlapped with Stephen Colbert (his understudy for a time), Tina Fey, and Adam McKay. He also met his future wife, then Nancy Walls, at Second City; she was a student in an improv class he taught who would outpace him early in their respective careers when she landed a slot as a cast member on Saturday Night Live in the 1995-96 season. (Today, Nancy works as a producer; she and Carell coproduce Angie Tribeca, a TBS comedy series starring his former Office castmate Rashida Jones.) Carell got his own break not long after Nancy’s when he was cast, along with Colbert, on Dana Carvey’s short-lived (but beloved by comedy geeks) primetime ABC sketch show. In 1999, on Colbert’s recommendation, he was hired on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show, where he served for six years as a goofily enthusiastic correspondent.

He won attention from critics and audiences for supporting roles in Bruce Almighty (2003) and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004). On the set of the latter, Carell met Judd Apatow, a producer on the film, who invited him to get in touch if he had any good movie ideas. Carell thought he did. “So I went into Judd’s office and I pitched him an idea. We talked for an hour and a half and, you know, he thought it was fine.” Fine, Carell’s tone suggests, as in only okay. “And just as I was getting up, I said, ‘Oh, and there’s this other secondary idea about a guy who’s never had sex.’ And Judd sparked to that immediately and said, ‘I can sell that to Universal tomorrow.’ And literally the next week he mentioned it in passing to an executive at Universal and they bought it on the spot.”

With Carell and Apatow cowriting the script and Apatow directing—it was his first feature—The 40-Year-Old Virgin became a huge hit, buoyed by Carell’s earnest, sweet-natured performance and his easy chemistry with costar Catherine Keener, which grounded the wilder jokes and relocated the unlikely premise somewhere near believability. Yet Universal, perhaps suffering from buyer’s remorse, had shut down the production after its first week of shooting because the studio’s executives were concerned that, as Carell put it, “the dailies of my character just looked too creepy. They said I looked like a serial killer.”

He and Apatow assured the studio they just hadn’t gotten to the scenes with heart. The thing would work—promise! But others had doubts, too. “I had a high school reunion just before the movie came out,” Carell said. “I hadn’t seen these people in several years. And they’d start talking about what they’d been involved in, and I would mention that I just did this movie called 40-Year-Old Virgin, and as I reflect back, I realize how dumb it must have sounded to all of these people. It sounded like it might be the worst movie ever, just based on the title. I could feel my classmates feeling sorry for me. I could see the pity in their eyes.”

Starring on an American remake of The Office, Ricky Gervais’s mean-spirited, cult-favorite British TV series, was another career move that didn’t necessarily look great on paper. Fans of the original rolled their eyes, and the first season debuted on NBC in March 2005 to mixed reviews and indifferent ratings. It was the pre-release buzz for The 40-Year-Old Virgin that helped persuade the network to renew the show for a second season. With Carell now something of a household name and the series finding its creative sea legs, The Office would double its ratings in season two and win the Emmy for outstanding comedy series, while its star would receive the first of six nominations—inexplicably, he never won—for lead actor in a comedy series.

In between seasons, Carell shot a number of broad movie comedies, including Evan Almighty (2007), Get Smart (2008), and Date Night (2010), which all did okay at the box office but weren’t nearly as interesting as what he was doing on TV. He wasn’t slumming, but he wasn’t moving the needle on his career, either. To hear him tell it, however, that career was something of a left turn in the first place.

Unlike a lot of comedians and comic actors, Carell insists he didn’t grow up desperate to get laughs. He wasn’t even a particular fan of the genre as a kid, though he did love listening to comedy albums. “Especially George Carlin and Steve Martin—over and over I’d listen to those routines. I think what I didn’t realize at the time was that I was studying. I was trying to understand what made them funny, why I enjoyed it so much, what they were doing with the language, what they were doing with the misdirection. Steve Martin in particular, his brand of comedy was so different and so absurdist that I really took to that immediately. But I never thought of myself as particularly funny.

“When I moved to Chicago, I didn’t aspire to be a comedic actor,” he continued. “I just wanted to work, and those were just the jobs I tended to get more often, the comic parts. I kind of ended up doing it out of necessity.”

I asked why he thought he got those roles. “I don’t know.” He paused, mulling it over. “I clearly did better at that than the straight stuff. I think there are generally more actors who audition for straight roles, so just by the odds, I think you have better odds going for a comedic role because some people are afraid to try it.” He paused again. “I don’t know. In Chicago, I just kind of fell into that community. I wanted to get experience. I wasn’t too concerned about how I was going to be labeled. I was just interested in working.”

I wondered whether there was something binary in his approaches to broad comedy and drama—if he was drawing on different sides of his brain, as it were—or whether there was more of a continuum in his approach, no matter the material. “That’s an interesting question,” he replied hesitantly, as if he hadn’t considered it before (or kindly wanted me to believe he hadn’t). “I think it’s sort of the same. Whether a character’s super-broad or incredibly internalized, the most important thing to me is that some sort of honesty registers, that you can tell that these are human beings.” He put on a mock-serious voice: “That is my goal: to depict someone that falls within the realm of human being.” He laughed, then turned genuine-serious again. “You know, you do your research. You think about backstory. Even the silliest characters or the darkest characters or even the most insidious characters, there’s lots of different components to them that you don’t necessarily have to say out loud or have register in a movie, but they should be present somewhere. I think about Peter Sellers and how he was able to do those incredibly broad characters, but at the same time you always knew that it was a person. Clouseau”— Sellers’s bumbling inspector from the Pink Panther movies—“was a real person. He was absurd, he was silly, but he was going through something. To me, that character was all about a man retaining his dignity, and that felt very honest and truthful to me. Hence all the stuff he did was that much funnier because you felt like you were watching an actual human being going through human emotions.”

He brought up Michael Scott and how he had worked to give the character a well-meaning if oblivious side to anchor the comedy of boorishness. “I know people like that who really, through no fault of their own, can be off-putting, but at the same time I know them to be good people. That’s what we were going for with Michael. I just thought, He’s a pretty complicated guy—a lot of different facets to him.” Similarly, he said, he had worked hard to locate a “sad story” somewhere in John du Pont’s psychological makeup.

Well, then: What was the backstory for Brick Tamland, the earnest, deranged, possibly brain-damaged weatherman Carell played in the two Anchorman movies? He laughed. “The whole interview should be about what’s Brick’s story. Brick might be the anomaly. I think the less that’s revealed about Brick Tamland, the better. Brick can get away with doing anything because there’s no frame of reference to his life in any way. So he can appear at his own funeral, or he can just pull out a gun from the future or be holding a hand grenade for no good reason. Characters like that are really fun because they’re just such wild cards. On Anchorman, the first one, I had almost no lines. I was obviously a member of the news team, but Adam McKay”—the director of both—“would tell me to just make a comment at the end of the scene. And I’d say whatever came to mind. And generally it wasn’t related at all to what was going on. It was some sort of flight of fancy in this guy’s head.” But Carell blurted those lines with such conviction that you believe Brick when he declares, “I ate a big red candle” or, in an outtake appended to the credits, “I pooped a hammer.” It’s funny because it seems true.

Brick aside, my own favorite Carell performance is Bobby Riggs in Battle of the Sexes, a film that deserved to be more widely seen. (Carell allowed that he agrees.) If Riggs’s greatest contribution to history was serving as a foil to Billie Jean King, his second greatest was providing a vehicle for the full breadth of Carell’s talent. He inhabited Riggs’s clownish but cunning public persona with a comic brio equal to the original’s, while shading his offstage moments with doubt, melancholy, and a more self-aware kind of cunning—a buffoon in full, and an unexpectedly moving one at that.

Welcome to Marwen is another film taking full advantage of Carell’s binary/not-binary skills. Based on the critically praised 2010 documentary Marwencol, the new movie tells the true-ish story (Hollywood true, let’s say) of Mark Hogancamp, an artist who lives in upstate New York and who once specialized in World War II illustrations. In 2000, however, he became the victim of a vicious hate crime when he was badly beaten up in a bar fight and left for dead in the parking lot by five men who singled him out because they had heard he was a cross-dresser. He survived after nine days in a coma but lost most of his memories along with his ability to draw. Needing a new creative outlet, Hogancamp created a 1:6 scale replica of a World War II-era Belgian town in his backyard that he populated with dolls representing women he knew, as well as an alter ego, Captain Hoagie; he added Nazi dolls to represent his attackers and arranged the whole cast in tableaux for photographs—not only a new medium but also a kind of ad hoc psychotherapy, an adult version of a kid reenacting trauma with dolls in a child psychiatrist’s office. Hogancamp’s artful pictures of what he called Marwencol eventually found their way to galleries. (I’d explain the discrepancy between Marwencol and Marwen, but that would be something of a spoiler.)

Welcome to Marwen bounces between a straightforward depiction of Hogancamp’s somewhat precarious day-to-day existence and fantasy sequences reflecting his interior life, in which the dolls (played by Carell and fellow live-action castmates, including Leslie Mann and Janelle Monae) are animated through the motion-capture technology Zemeckis helped pioneer in films like The Polar Express and Beowulf. The fantasy sequences have a deliberately campy, comic edge, and the tonal shift is what led the director to cast Carell. “I needed someone who was a great actor, someone who could evoke emotion and pathos playing a damaged, broken character suffering from PTSD,” Zemeckis told me. But he also required a performer who could affect “all this World War II—movie swagger” for the Barbies-at-war scenes. “I needed an actor who could do both,” he said, “and Steve fit the bill perfectly.”

I saw an unfinished version of the movie, and I think it will appeal in particular to fans of Zemeckis’s Forrest Gump—a very different movie, but one that’s tonally and thematically similar to Welcome to Marwen. As in Beautiful Boy, Carell does some subtle but affecting physical work. There are moments when you can see the accumulated emotional pain of Hogancamp’s trauma weighing down on Carell’s shoulders as he walks away from the camera, and the legacy of physical therapy in each deliberate step. “That’s the stuff of a great actor,” Zemeckis said. “He transforms his entire physicality.” Yet there’s nothing showy about Carell’s performance, in a role that other stars who started out in silly comedies might have gone “full Patch Adams” with, to misquote Tropic Thunder.

VICE follows Dick Cheney’s career over several decades. It will be Carell’s fourth movie with McKay, after the two Anchorman films and The Big Short. (I wish the filmmakers had stuck with the snarky working title, Back Seat—as in driver.) The cast includes Christian Bale as the former vice-president, Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney, Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush, and Tyler Perry as Colin Powell. Carell showed me a picture on his phone of himself in makeup as Rumsfeld, and the transformation was astonishing: If he didn’t look exactly like the former secretary of defense, he looked like Rumsfeld in an odd, slightly unrepresentative photograph, or maybe Rummy on a day when the air conditioners have broken at Madame Tussauds.

This role might be the greatest challenge yet to Carell’s ability to plumb character and find a little human something or other deep inside that actually bleeds—but as Rumsfeld himself once said, you go to war with the army you have. “I went into it thinking, Here’s a man, a very smart man, who is clearly flawed, but he also believed what he was doing,” Carell told me. He read as much as he could about Rumsfeld—biographies as well as Rumsfeld’s own books. (He’s written two memoirs and a book of “leadership lessons.”) “People have an idea about Rumsfeld, but it’s a very narrow idea. I felt like it was my job to expand that and paint a broader picture of who he was, what he feared, what was upsetting to him. It’s easy to just play a caricature or watch some film clip and then say, ‘I’ll just do that.’ It’s a little cavalier to say that I understand what makes Donald Rumsfeld tick, or John du Pont. But I’ve made an attempt. You do the best you can with the material you have, with the sources you have, and with your imagination.”

What would be the logical end point of that challenge? Could he, would he, play . . . Donald Trump? Could he find the humanity beneath the laughable hair, the revolting racism and sexism, and the predatory personality disorder? (That is my characterization; Carell doesn’t broadcast his political views, though he did make a campaign appearance for Hillary Clinton in 2016.) He thought it over for a moment. “You hope you can find the humanity in anybody that you play,” he finally said. “If I couldn’t, then I wouldn’t play that part. If you go into a part with complete disdain and find no nugget of humanity in a person—I just wouldn’t do it.” (I’ll note that Michael Scott had a copy of Trump’s book Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life on his bookshelf for several seasons of The Office.)

I pointed out it had been a while since Carell had made an out-and-out, big-laugh comedy. “I think it’s been about six years,” he said, counting back to early 2013, when he shot Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (and not including a couple Despicable Me movies). This wasn’t a deliberate career choice, just that “the stuff that was interesting to me tended to be more dramatic.” He’d like to do a broad comedy again, he said, and was developing some projects along those lines.

But the rules of comedy have changed quite a bit in the last half decade, even in the last year. Jokes and characters that once seemed harmless might now generate social-media outrage, if not boycotts and involuntary sabbaticals. Carell’s thoughts returned to Michael Scott. “Because The Office is on Netflix and replaying, a lot more people have seen it recently,” he said. “And I think because of that there’s been a resurgence in interest in the show, and talk about bringing it back. But apart from the fact that I just don’t think that’s a good idea, it might be impossible to do that show today and have people accept it the way it was accepted ten years ago. The climate’s different. I mean, the whole idea of that character, Michael Scott, so much of it was predicated on inappropriate behavior. I mean, he’s certainly not a model boss. A lot of what is depicted on that show is completely wrong-minded. That’s the point, you know? But I just don’t know how that would fly now. There’s a very high awareness of offensive things today—which is good, for sure. But at the same time, when you take a character like that too literally, it doesn’t really work.”

At this point, Carell and I had been talking for more than two and a half hours. The restaurant had settled into a midafternoon lull. I was flagging, too. (I had a bad summer cold, and thanks to overdoses of Claritin and Mucinex, I kept hallucinating that Carell’s face had turned into Al Pacino’s from that movie where Pacino played the devil opposite Keanu Reeves.) But Carell was happy to keep going. He was concerned he hadn’t been interesting enough—not true, and again telling—and the conversation turned to actors he admires. Besides the aforementioned Peter Sellers, he named Tina Fey and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Of the latter, he said, “She’s royalty. She’s another one who can play a comedic character, who can go super-broad in any direction but you always believe it. That center of humanity is always there.”

And that’s where we ended things, a little more college talk and a few parting pleasantries aside—with Carell turning a spotlight on someone else, fittingly enough.

THE AGE OF DEMOCRAZY

I. A Momentous Juncture

Francis Fukuyama went to bed early on the night of November 8, 2016. The sixty-six-year-old social theorist had accepted a conditional assignment to write about the U. S. presidential election for the Financial Times if and only if the victor in that contest was the man widely assumed to be on his way to a historic defeat. “I didn’t think I would have to write the piece,” he told me. The following morning, he was forced to conclude that liberal democracy, whose triumph as “the final form of human government” he had risen to fame declaring three decades ago, was threatened from within as it had not been in his lifetime. “The risk of sliding into a world of competitive and equally angry nationalisms is huge,” he wrote on November 9, “and if this happens it would mark as momentous a juncture as the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.”

That year signaled not just a new stage of world history but also the emergence of Fukuyama, then thirty-seven, as its oracle. A young man of enormous intellectual energy, ambition, and brio, he published an article titled “The End of History?” in an obscure neoconservative policy journal. Announcing “the total exhaustion of viable systematic alternatives to Western liberalism,” the article set the intellectual world alight and led to profiles in Time and The New York Times Magazine.

A protege of the philosophy professor Allan Bloom at Cornell, Fukuyama had distinguished himself as a foreign-policy advisor to George H. W. Bush by staking out an aggressive position with respect to the breakup of the Warsaw Pact and the reunification of Germany, among other inflection points on the way to the sudden collapse of the communist world. Fukuyama was not merely reacting to events but testing an explanatory framework, drawn from the nineteenth-century German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel (the same framework used by Karl Marx to explain the inevitability of worldwide communist revolution).

The claim was never that human conflict was a thing of the past but rather that history was a coherent and directional process. By “end,” Fukuyama referred to a “goal” of history rather than a terminus, meaning that the “basic principles of the liberal democratic state could not be improved upon” by the communist utopia, or by any other, because liberal democratic principles were the only ones capable of satisfying the craving, inherent in every individual, for recognition of one’s moral equality. Fukuyama called this craving thymos, borrowing a term from Socrates.

The essay went on to herald the “triumph of the West” and “the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution.” Such ringing, peremptory formulations were unsurpassable evocations of the euphoria of that historic moment, permanently inscribing Fukuyama into the annals of intellectual history—whether as sage or fool, or something in between, only posterity would tell.

A minor aspect of every geopolitical crisis since then has been the ritualized use of Fukuyama’s name as a piñata in the prestige media, asserting some variant of “The End of the End of History.” But the underlying trend of the succeeding years was a continuous expansion of democracy. Between 1975 and 2005, the number of electoral democracies increased from around 35 to 110 and overall gross domestic product grew by a factor of four.

In the mid-2000s, however, that trend began to reverse itself and the world went into what Fukuyama calls a “democratic recession.” China and Russia have grown more authoritarian and assertive. Hungary, Turkey, Thailand, and Poland have regressed toward increasingly illiberal democracy. The Arab Spring descended into civil war throughout the Middle East. Anti-immigrant and anti—European Union parties gained strength in Germany, Austria, France, the Netherlands, even Sweden. And in 2016, Britain voted to leave the EU, and Donald Trump, running on an explicitly nativist platform, was elected president.

“The world is not moving toward greater democracy or converging toward greater openness,” Fukuyama conceded. “But it’s still too early to tell whether this is just a glitch akin to a market correction or some kind of permanent state of affairs. . . . People still would rather live in a prosperous, well-governed country than in Guatemala or Nepal or Zimbabwe, and so long as that’s the case, there will continue to be a lot of grassroots pressure for the institutions that produce stable, rich countries.”

We were speaking in his vacation cottage in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, several weeks before the publication of his latest book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment. It is an airy, open space sparsely furnished with intricately carved woodworks of Fukuyama’s own hand. Carmel-by-the-Sea is a place apart from the country at large, a bubble of tranquility blessed with a microclimate several degrees cooler than its surrounding environs, overlooking perhaps the loveliest stretch of coastline anywhere in California. None of the houses in the one-square-mile town has a street number, to protect the privacy of its many well-known residents.

Fukuyama speaks rapidly but with such evenness of cadence that he always conveys an impression of leisurely contemplation. His whole being appears to incline toward a temperamental moderation that is instinctively dialectical, always seeking to reconcile apparently contrary truths. This habit of mind seems at once precisely what the country needs more of at the moment and precisely what is being ousted from the discourse as the doomsayers commandeer the airwaves and mob the mobile device.

“As a citizen, I am horrified,” Fukuyama said of Trump. “As a political scientist, I am delighted.”

The rise of such a figure is “a kind of natural experiment where we get to see how theories like checks and balances work in practice and where we can gauge how strong American institutions are. It’s all just theoretical until these concepts are challenged.”

It is perhaps this division into distinct roles of concerned citizen and disinterested analyst that allows Fukuyama to preserve his rhetorical equanimity. He has avoided what he calls the “overdrawn” comparisons to 1930s Germany that have issued from the mouths of some of his colleagues, and he holds himself at a remove from the “Resistance.” “I think in the end our democratic system is perfectly adequate to contain Trump.” Though ultimately, he noted, it’s not the rivalrous branches of government or the federal bureaucracy or the courts upon whom the burden of holding Trump in check rests. “In a democracy, the ultimate check is always electoral,” he said. “If the Democrats manage to win back at least the House, they can start to undo some of the damage Trump has done.” And if not? “Then we’re in deep shit.”

II. A Master Concept

Politics was organized until recently “along a left-right spectrum defined by economic issues,” as Fukuyama puts it in Identity, which he wrote while shuttling between his vacation cottage and his house in Palo Alto, where he teaches at Stanford. But increasingly, the global political system has become a battleground for competing demands for recognition. Identity can be seen as an earnest attempt to keep the bloody passageway back into history shut.

In the book, Fukuyama probes beyond the immediate triggers of the populist nationalist upsurge to the deeper sources of the discord threatening to undo liberal democracy. He situates this discord in thymos, the universal craving for recognition, which he argues can serve as a master concept to explain “the dynamic new forces” currently shaping world events. It is thymos, Fukuyama argues, that is the seat of identity politics—a phrase typically associated with the Left but which he applies more broadly—and thymos that accounts for the increasingly bitter fragmentation of countries around the world into hostile camps. Indeed, almost anyone can construe themselves as in some manner oppressed, and such claims are inherently more difficult to satisfy than economic ones.

Fukuyama divides thymos into two different forms: “isothymia,” the desire to be seen as equal to everyone else, and “megalothymia,” the desire to be seen as superior. Liberal democracy can be “subverted internally” by either. In a remarkable passage, Fukuyama notes that “the passion for equal recognition . . . does not necessarily diminish with the achievement of greater de facto equality and material abundance, but may actually be stimulated by it. Tocqueville explained that when the differences between social classes or groups are great and supported by longstanding tradition, people become resigned or accepting of them. But when society is mobile and groups pull closer to one another, people become more acutely aware and resentful of the remaining differences.”

Back in 1992, Fukuyama was blithe about the “smallness of actually existing inequalities.” By the early 2010s, he had begun to sound the alarm about the rise of wealthy and powerful elites rigging the political system in their favor. This capture had led to “political decay,” in which special-interest groups were able to block the popular will, including on hot-button issues such as immigration, where polling indicated that a broad consensus existed. He began to call for a renewed left-wing movement to contest the growing consolidation of power.

Fukuyama is hardly a trusted figure among Democrats, though he has, in recent years, taken to railing against what conservatism has become. He is exasperated with the large faction of the electorate willing to be persuaded by the crude and dishonest appeals of a man he took to be “a total idiot completely unqualified to be president.” But while deploring the remedy to which these voters resorted, he acknowledges the grievances that fueled their resentments. “Both the financial crises in the U. S. and the Eurozone and the migrant crises in Europe were regarded as elite-leadership failures, and rightly so in both cases. They did screw up.”

Yet traditional parties of the Left have been hemorrhaging support throughout Europe despite a three-decade rise in economic inequality in countries all around the globe. Fukuyama noted that the left-wing Occupy Wall Street movement “marched and demonstrated, then fizzled out,” while the Tea Party “succeeded in taking over both the Republican Party and much of Congress.” Instead of articulating an overarching vision of economic justice, many on the Left seem intent on elaborating ever more fractionated identity categories demanding recognition—a move that is intrinsically at cross-purposes to one that seeks change through mass democratic means. “The Democrats have become the party of minorities, white professionals, and educated white women,” Fukuyama said, “while the Republicans are the white people’s party. It’s a moral disaster for American democracy.”

III. An Incidental Fact

Fukuyama’s grandfather was an immigrant from Japan. He came to the United States in 1905, when it was still a nation with mostly open borders, to evade the draft for the Russo-Japanese war. He built a successful hardware store in downtown Los Angeles and became a community leader in Little Tokyo. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was rounded up and sent to an internment camp by the U. S. government for the duration of World War II. Given two weeks to sell off his business, he did so to a white competitor for virtually nothing. “He basically lost his lifetime’s work,” Fukuyama said. After his release, Fukuyama’s grandfather was never able to establish himself in business again. When he finally became a naturalized citizen, he cast his first vote in the U. S. presidential election of1964. The vote he cast was for Barry Goldwater.

“A lot of immigrants become quite conservative,” Fukuyama noted, explaining why the seemingly perverse vote, which his liberal father regarded as an outrage, was in fact consistent with the experience of migration and loss his grandfather had endured. “They feel that they worked hard to earn their place in this country, that America was a land of opportunity, that they had done well, and what was theirs was theirs.” Fukuyama is skeptical of projections of a “permanent Democratic majority” based on a ruling coalition of white liberals and minorities, in part because of his grandfather’s story. He noted that certain polls show that a slight majority of Hispanics—51 percent, according to Harvard-Harris—support stricter enforcement of immigration laws.

I wanted to know about Fukuyama’s background because he has just written a book about identity in which he doesn’t mention his own. Fukuyama is one of a handful of enduring public intellectuals in America. He is also a person of Japanese ancestry. But he has always regarded the latter as an incidental rather than an essential fact about himself. “I grew up in a period when everybody just wanted to be Americans. Not Japanese Americans. Not holding on to our ethnic separateness.” The assertion seems a little quaint coming from an American academic in 2018. His consciousness of that fact imbues it with a touch of defiance.

“I never felt like I was different from other people,” Fukuyama said, a statement expressing a certain confident mid-century American consensus on the identity of the nation in which he was born—that the country has a single national identity expansive enough to encompass people of foreign descent like himself. Hearing him express it so bluntly in the context of today’s overheated discourse on identity reminds us just how rapidly the conceptual ground has shifted in a single lifetime.

Fukuyma went to a predominantly Jewish, strongly left-leaning private school in the Bronx, Riverdale Country Day. The progressivism of that time, the 1960s, insisted that America must be held to its own founding ideals. It was the next generation of academic radicals that began to insist that those ideals were themselves part of the apparatus of oppression. Fukuyama’s father always told him that “being forced to speak only English in school was the best thing that ever happened to him,” because it placed him on an equal footing with his peers, and that being Japanese “never prevented me from doing anything I wanted to do.” The message was that his son too should approach the world with this expectation and not that he was psychically vulnerable to small, backhanded slights. One senses that Fukuyama has no regrets for embracing it.

After a short stint studying deconstruction with the postmodern thinkers Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes in Paris and comparative literature with Paul de Man at Yale, Fukuyama switched to the government department at Harvard, where he worked with Samuel Huntington. While the peers he left behind in the humanities made the long march through the universities, promulgating the deconstructionist, feminist, postcolonial, multicultural, and queer theories that have unseated the Western canon within those institutions, Fukuyama and his friends, a group that included Paul Wolfowitz (another Bloom protege) and Lewis “Scooter” Libby, went to Washington, D. C., to work in the Pentagon and the State Department.

The “End of History” thesis, stripped of its internal texture and ambivalence and transformed into a meme, can be said to have played a role in the creation of the Bush Doctrine. But Fukuyama broke with Wolfowitz and Libby over their advocacy of preemptive war in Iraq. If “The End of History?” was “Marxist” in its framework, Fukuyama said, his neocon friends had become “Leninist” in believing the U. S. had the power to hasten the movement of history through military force. He believes they drew the wrong lessons from the Reagan years, specifically the belief that undemocratic societies would simply default toward democracy if we toppled their dictators. The Trump years have, however, brought Fukuyama back into contact with some of his old cohort. At a recent private meeting, he ran into Bill Kristol and Max Boot. “Boot told me, ‘You realized the bankruptcy of conservatism long before I did.’”

Fukuyama was never an exponent of the globalist, open-borders cosmopolitanism with which “The End of History?” came to be associated among those who had never read it. He has always believed, for instance, that the nation-state is the “largest political unit that is viable in terms of actually delivering . . . stability and security” and that some irrational patriotic attachment to the state is a necessary aspect of sustaining its unity. In the last chapter of Identity, Fukuyama proposes compulsory national service to force Americans to encounter and cooperate with one another across class and party lines. He calls for the assimilation of immigrants into a culture that isn’t afraid to say what it values and what it rejects.

And finally, while calling for the redress of injustices brought to light by social movements such as Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, he urges the Left to abandon a conception of identity that undermines “the American national story by emphasizing victimization” in favor of “a progressive narrative” that “can also be told about the overcoming of barriers and the ever-broadening circles of people whose dignity the country has recognized, based on its founding principles.” All of which sounds eminently sensible, as many reviewers have largely acknowledged, but will anyone be listening? “I really wrote this book for an audience that is unlikely to heed it,” Fukuyama observed.

IV. A Curious Paradox

In the last paragraph of “The End of History?” Fukuyama posited that history’s finale would be a “very sad time,” in which the heroic exertions made on the road to attaining liberal democracy would give way to “the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands.”

The first four sections of his 1992 book, The End of History and the Last Man, describe how the thymotic drive, together with science and technology, leads history toward what Hegel called “the universal and homogenous state” of liberal democracy. The fifth, final, and most intriguing section of the book—which is among the most misunderstood and brilliant books of its time—shows why even a liberal democracy that has crossed over into a “post-historical” condition can be undone from within by the very same energy that brought it into existence.

He argued that even though liberal democracy does a better job than any conceivable system of government at satisfying desire, reason, and thymos at once, this does not mean that the problem of thymos is therefore solved. This is because thymos is a volatile aspect of human nature that can be channeled into benign pursuits, constrained by institutions, pacified by abundance, or directed toward great and useful works, but it can never be (nor should we want it to be) permanently quelled.

“Human life, then, involves a curious paradox: It seems to require injustice, for the struggle against injustice is what calls forth what is highest in man,” Fukuyama wrote, before speculating about the emergence of men and women raised in the bosom of liberal democracy who grow bored with its very tranquility and come to “struggle against that peace and prosperity, and against democracy.”

This is the view from the End of History.

MILKING THE SYSTEM

Devin Nunes has a secret. Nunes is the California Republican and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who has become famous in the Trump era for using his position as a battering ram to discredit the Russia investigation and protect Donald Trump at all costs, even if it means shredding his own reputation and the independence of the historically nonpartisan committee in the process.

First elected to Congress in 2002, Nunes wasn’t always like this. At one time he was known for his independent streak. When a new class of radical House Republicans pushed its leadership to shut down the government in 2013, Nunes attacked them as “lemmings with suicide vests.” In 2015, during another tumultuous period of House GOP infighting, I interviewed a broad cross section of the chamber’s Republican leadership, and Nunes stood out for comments he made about how his colleagues and constituents were siloed in right-wing echo chambers and increasingly reliant on this or that “conspiracy theory” rather than “something that is mostly true.” In hindsight, he was prescient about the direction of his party: A few years later, a bona fide conspiracy theorist, one who credited Alex Jones with his victory, was elected president.

Instead of continuing the fight, Nunes served on the president’s transition team and became Trump’s most important defender in Congress. He has used the Intelligence Committee to spin a baroque theory about alleged surveillance of the Trump campaign that began with a made-up Trump tweet about how “Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower.” Indeed, Nunes has worked closely with the White House to investigate the FBI rather than the FSB (the KGB’s successor), most famously by attempting to undermine the Russia investigation by releasing a partisan report—the so-called “Nunes memo”— that cherry-picked evidence to accuse the FBI of bias in its effort to obtain a warrant to monitor the communications of Carter Page, a Trump foreign-policy advisor.

Nunes has always been reliably conservative, but on some issues, he has broken with his party. He has long supported moderate immigration reform, for instance, including amnesty for many undocumented people living and working in the U. S. But as Trump has instituted a draconian policy of zero tolerance for all undocumented people and argued that every undocumented individual should be deported, Nunes has been silent. More recently, as Trump and the House Republicans have celebrated Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the agency’s aggressive tactics, Nunes has followed suit. On CaRepublican.com—a Nunes-created news site, which mimics the Drudge Report—he now regularly highlights articles attacking Democrats for being insufficiently supportive of ICE’s raids and deportations.

Which brings us back to Nunes’s secret.

Nunes grew up in a family of dairy farmers in Tulare, California, and as long as he has been in politics, his family dairy has been central to his identity and a feature of every major political profile written about him. A March story in National Review is emblematic. It describes how Nunes’s family emigrated from the Azores in Portugal to California’s Central Valley, “a fertile, sunny Eden,” and how the family “worked and saved enough money to buy a 640-acre farm outside Tulare.” The soil of the Central Valley is depicted as almost sacred in these articles. National Review quotes a 1912 Portuguese immigrant farmer who wrote that when he grabs a clump of dirt, “I feel as if I had just shaken hands with all my ancestors.” As recently as July 27, the lead of a Wall Street Journal editorial-page piece about Nunes, which featured a Tulare dateline, emphasized the dairy: “It’s 105 degrees as I stand with Rep. Devin Nunes on his family’s dairy farm.” Last year, Nunes noted in an interview with the Daily Beast—headline: “The Dairy Farmer Overseeing U. S. Spies and the Russia Hack Investigation”—“I’m pretty simple. I like agriculture.” The Daily Beast noted, “The cows are not far from his mind. He keeps in regular contact with his brother and father about their dairy farm.”

So here’s the secret: The Nunes family dairy of political lore—the one where his brother and parents work—isn’t in California. It’s in Iowa. Devin; his brother, Anthony III; and his parents, Anthony Jr. and Toni Dian, sold their California farmland in 2006. Anthony Jr. and Toni Dian, who has also been the treasurer of every one of Devin’s campaigns since 2001, used their cash from the sale to buy a dairy eighteen hundred miles away in Sibley, a small town in northwest Iowa where they— as well as Anthony III, Devin’s only sibling, and his wife, Lori—have lived since 2007. Devin’s uncle Gerald still owns a dairy back in Tulare, which is presumably where The Wall Street Journal’s reporter talked to Devin, and Devin is an investor in a Napa Valley winery, Alpha Omega, but his immediate family’s farm—as well as his family—is long gone.

There’s nothing particularly strange about a congressman’s family moving. But what is strange is that the family has apparently tried to conceal the move from the public— for more than a decade. As far as I could tell, as of late August, neither Nunes nor the local California press that covers him had ever publicly mentioned that his family dairy is no longer in Tulare.

For example, in 2010 Nunes traveled to northwest Iowa to campaign for Steve King, the most anti-immigrant member of Congress, who now represents Nunes’s parents, brother, and sister-in-law in Sibley. It was an unusual place to find Devin Nunes, given that at the time he wasn’t known to be hostile to immigrants in the way that has made King, who has called illegal immigration a “slow-motion terrorist attack,” so infamous.

King’s office posted a press release online announcing that the town-hall event would be in Le Mars, a town fifty miles southwest of Sibley, and included some biographical information about Nunes, including this fact: “Congressman Nunes’ family has operated a dairy farm in Tulare County, California for three generations.” There was no mention that the Nunes family actually lived up the road in Sibley, where they operated a dairy. Strange.

In June 2009, an obscure dairy trade publication, Dairy Star, ran a profile of the Nunes family dairy in Sibley. The article documents how the Nunes family, “recent transplants to the Midwest,” emigrated from Portugal to California to Iowa and started NuStar Farms, which Anthony Jr. manages with his son and wife. The article mentions numerous Nunes family members, including Uncle Gerald, who was still back in California, and baby Maci, “the first Nunes to be born outside of California or Portugal,” but there is one person missing from the article: Devin Nunes.

Why would the Nuneses, Steve King, and an obscure dairy publication all conspire to hide the fact that the congressman’s family sold its farm and moved to Iowa? I went to Sibley to find out. Things got a little strange.

The first thing I did when I landed in Iowa, on August 27, was call Jerry Nelson, the author of the Dairy Star article. I’d read through Nelson’s other online articles. He’s funny and smart and could easily be a columnist at a major newspaper. When he was thirty, he almost died in a bizarre manure-pit accident, and he told me that since then he’s lived every day like it’s a blessing.

He was upfront and clear about why Representative Nunes wasn’t included in the Dairy Star profile of the Nunes family and the move to Iowa: The family asked him not to mention Devin. “They said, ‘Our brother’s involved in politics and we’re not going to talk about it and that’s that,’ ” Nelson told me. “And I said, ‘Okay, we’re here to talk about dairy farms.’ ” Sibley, Iowa, is in the far north of the state, twenty minutes from the Minnesota border. It has twenty-six hundred people and feels smaller. The biggest attractions in town are a well-groomed golf course and a high-end coffee shop, the Lantern, which was named the best in Iowa by the Food Network. I stopped in at the Lantern, a big exposed-brick space with fancy espresso equipment, to meet with Joshua Harms, a web developer and local troublemaker who became a First Amendment cause celebre this year after the town threatened to sue him if he didn’t take down his website, shouldyoumovetosibleyia.com, which documented a foul smell emanating from one of Sibley’s major businesses, a pigblood processing plant. The ACLU championed Harms’s case and sued Sibley. The town quickly folded, wrote Harms an apology, and agreed to train its staff and lawyers in First Amendment law. The case made international headlines and embarrassed Sibley.

Harms is a Bernie Sanders supporter, which makes him an outlier in the town. Sibley is the seat of Osceola County, which voted 79 percent to 17 percent for Trump over Clinton, making it one of the most pro-Trump bastions in America. Steve King won the county in 2 016 with a similar margin. The locals “tend to be very conservative, and of course they all are Trump backers,” said Nelson. Art Cullen, a Pulitzer prize—winning journalist at the nearby Storm Lake Times, told me that much of the population is “Dutch Reform and very religious.” So I was only a little surprised when the owner of the coffee shop, Brenda Hoyer, asked, “Are you a believer?” as she came over to take my order. I muttered something about growing up Catholic and ordered an iced tea.

Hoyer’s extended family, including grandkids, were milling around the shop. The place had a welcoming family vibe and more diversity than you might expect. I noticed several Hispanic women eating pastries and speaking Spanish at a nearby table. Sibley is actually 8 percent Hispanic, and that growing population largely provides the labor for the area’s meatpacking, poultry, and dairy industries. Immigrants are essential to Iowa, which has an estimated forty thousand undocumented residents, mostly Hispanics, according to a 2014 report from the Pew Research Center. I was visiting the state just days after police found the body of Mollie Tibbetts, who was allegedly killed by an undocumented worker from a dairy farm, and everyone was talking about immigration. In a speech, Trump had used Tibbetts’s murder as a cudgel to bash “Democrat immigration policies” that he said were “spilling very innocent blood.”

Hoyer and I talked about Trump. She admitted she wasn’t crazy about the tweets and his messy personal life. She liked Mike Pence and noted “it would be a good deal” if Trump were impeached and replaced by Pence. When I told her I was working on a story about dairy farms, her ears perked up. She and her husband, Gene, were dairy farmers and had recently sold their business. “You should talk to Gene,” she said.

When I mentioned Trump’s immigration policy, she was quick to add, “Well, we don’t agree with him on that!”

Then she told me something that knocked the wind out of me: “My son recently took his life.” It came out of nowhere, and I barely knew how to respond. His name was Bailey. He was seventeen and he had died thirteen days ago. This was the first day the coffee shop had been open since his death. I noticed a Bible verse in chalk behind the counter: “Do not fear for I have redeemed you. I have summoned you by name. You are mine.” The Lantern, I later learned, was actually a ministry that, according to its website, provides “a safe place where everyone is welcome.” I liked it there and decided to make it my office while I was in Sibley.

Jerry Johnson, Sibley’s mayor, walked in. He was wearing golf attire, and whatever ill will existed between him and Harms over what Harms called “the blood plant” seemed to have faded. Perhaps because of the town’s troubles with First Amendment law, Johnson was especially gracious to me. I explained why I was in Sibley, and he immediately suggested that I stop by Anthony Nunes Jr.’s house to interview him. When the subject turned to Trump’s zero-tolerance policy on immigration, the mayor replied with what was already becoming a familiar refrain: “I don’t agree with him on that!”

The Nunes family dairy, NuStar Farms LLC, sits on forty-three acres surrounded by corn on the southern outskirts of Sibley, off Highway 60, a main route between Sioux City and Minneapolis. According to Dairy Star, they have about two thousand Jersey cows. A source told me that NuStar sells almost all of its milk to Wells, an ice cream company in Le Mars, which makes the Blue Bunny brand. The NuStar cows are housed in two seven-hundred-foot, white aluminum barns that are the most prominent feature of the farm. The western sides of the barns are outfitted with dozens of steel ventilation fans that look like rocket engines from a distance, almost as if a pair of space-shuttle boosters had dropped in the middle of a cornfield. I visited during silage season, when dairymen are out cutting corn to make winter feed for their cows. It had just rained, and the smell of fresh silage, like an intense version of freshly cut grass, filled my car as it rumbled down a dirt road to NuStar. As I approached the dairy, a white Yukon SUV exited from NuStar’s muddy parking lot and passed me. I saw Anthony Nunes Jr. in the cab of a tanker truck. Instead of bothering him at work, I decided to take the mayor’s advice and visit him at home the next day.

It didn’t go well.

I found the Nunes home on the far north edge of town, where the leafy neighborhood bumps up against the surrounding farmland. In the driveway was another white Yukon—the fancier Denali version. Anthony Jr. was pulling out of the driveway in a farm truck. I waved at him, and he abruptly stopped the truck in the street and walked over to my car. He was wearing jeans and a work shirt. I told him my name and asked him if I could talk to him for an article about his dairy. “I’m taking your license plate down and reporting you to the sheriff,” he said. “I don’t want to be bothered.” I asked him again if I could interview him and he repeated himself, but this time a lot louder. “I don’t want to be bothered anymore.” As he walked to his truck, he looked back and warned me: “If I see you again, I’m gonna get upset.” Apparently Sibley’s First Amendment training hadn’t filtered down to all its residents.

Other dairy farmers in the area helped me understand why the Nunes family might be so secretive about the farm: Midwestern dairies tend to run on undocumented labor. The northwest-Iowa dairy community is small. Most of the farmers know one another, and most belong to a regional trade group called the Western Iowa Dairy Alliance (though WIDA told me NuStar is not a member). One dairy farmer said that the threat of raids from ICE is so acute that WIDA members have discussed forming a NATO-like pact that would treat a raid on one dairy as a raid on all of them. The other pact members would provide labor to the raided dairy until it got back on its feet.

In every conversation I had with dairy farmers and industry insiders in northwest Iowa, it was taken as a fact that the local dairies are wholly dependent on undocumented labor. The low unemployment rate (it’s 2 percent in Osceola County), the low profit margins in the dairy business, and the global glut of milk that keeps prices low make hiring outside of the readily available pool of immigrants from Mexico and Guatemala unthinkable.

“Eighty percent of the Latino population out here in northwest Iowa is undocumented,” estimated one dairy farmer in the area who knows the Nunes family and often sees them while buying hay in nearby Rock Valley. “It would be great if we had enough unemployed Americans in northwest Iowa to milk the cows. But there’s just not. We have a very tight labor pool around here.” This person said the system was broken, leaving dairy farmers no choice. “I would love it if all my guys could be legal.”

The farmer explained that all the dairies require their workers to provide evidence of their legal status and pay the required state and federal taxes. But it’s an open secret that the system is built on easily obtained fraudulent documents. “I just look at the document—Hey, this looks like a good driver’s license, permanent resident card, whatever the case is—and that’s what you go with,” the farmer said. A second northwest-Iowa dairy farmer who knows the Nunes family told me, “They show you a Social Security card, we take out Social Security taxes. Where’d they get the card? I have no idea.” I asked what the chances are that a farm the size of NuStar uses only fully legal dairy workers. “It’s next to impossible,” the first dairy farmer said. “There’s no dang way.” This was speculation, but here is the logic that informed it: Most workers start at fourteen or fifteen dollars an hour, the first farmer said. If dairies had to use legal labor, they would likely have to raise that to eighteen or twenty dollars, and many dairies wouldn’t survive. “People are going to go broke,” the farmer said. The story was similar in the poultry, meatpacking, and other agricultural industries in the area.

What this person was describing was hard to wrap my head around. In the heart of Steve King’s district, a place that is more pro-Trump than almost any other patch of America, the economy is powered by workers that King and Trump have threatened to arrest and deport. I checked Anthony Nunes Jr.’s campaign-donor history. The only federal candidate he has ever donated to, besides his son, is Steve King ($250 in 2012). He also gives to the local Republican party of Osceola County, which, records show, transforms money into King’s congressional campaigns.

The absurdity of this situation—funding and voting for politicians whose core promise is to implement immigration policies that would destroy their livelihoods—has led some of the Republican-supporting dairymen to rethink their political priorities. “Everyone’s got this feeling that in agriculture, we, the employers, are going to be criminalized,” the first area dairy farmer I had spoken to said. “I’ve talked to Steve King face-to-face, and that guy doesn’t care one iota about us. He does not care. He believes that if you have one undocumented worker on your place, you should probably go to prison and we need to get as many undocumented people out of here as possible.” (A spokesman for King did not respond to multiple interview requests.) The second dairy farmer, speaking of Trump’s and King’s views on undocumented immigrants, added, “They want to send ’em alll back to Mexico and have them start over. What a crock of malarkey. Who’s gonna milk the cows?”

After my encounter with Anthony Jr., I met Jerry Nelson, the Dairy Star reporter, down at the Lantern. He wasn’t surprised by the hostility. Think about the story from the family’s perspective, he told me: “They are immigrants and Devin is a very strong supporter of Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump wants to shut down all of the immigration, and here is his family benefiting from immigrant labor,” documented or not.

Brenda Hoyer came by and said hello. I told her that I hoped it was okay to use her coffee shop for interviews. “Sure,” she said, “if you’re kind and truthful and honest.”

I asked Nelson what would happen, hypothetically, if ICE raided every dairy farm in the area tomorrow. “It would be a disaster for the dairies,” he said. “They would suddenly have nobody to milk or feed the cows. I don’t know what they would do.” The bell on the Lantern’s front door rang, and Hoyer huddled in the corner with a chubby man with dark, curly hair. After a few minutes, she came back over.

“You have a phone call,” she told Nelson.

“A phone call?” he asked. It made no sense. Anybody who knew where he was would call his cell. She asked him to come with her. A few minutes later, he returned in a panic and gathered his belongings. “We gotta go!” he told me.

On the way out I talked to Hoyer. Her demeanor had changed. I asked if I could still talk to Gene, her husband. She said it was no longer possible. I had to leave the coffee shop, she told me. “This article,” she said, “is going to destroy families.” As I walked out, I noticed the mysterious chubby man eyeing me.

Nelson was freaked out. There was no phone call, of course. The mysterious chubby man had asked Hoyer to have us ejected. According to Nelson, she had told him that an article about dairies and immigration would “destroy our lives out here.” It was an incredibly sensitive subject. “It’s kind of a third rail among dairy farmers,” Nelson said. “Whenever I go to a dairy farm, I never ask about the immigrant-labor thing unless they bring it up themselves.”

Later Nelson left me a voice mail in which he tried to explain the reaction. “Dairy farmers are very deeply patriotic and American, and yet here they are hiring these people who are not American,” he said. “And maybe they feel a little shame over that or feel like they are exploiting [people] and they don’t want that to come to light.”

Mayor Johnson was concerned about the run-in with Anthony Jr. He had suggested that I knock on the man’s door, and now he felt like the awkward encounter was his fault. He said he’d once had his own strange experience. A few years ago, the mayor reported one of Anthony Jr.’s workers, who was Hispanic, to the sheriffs office because Johnson believed the worker’s yard was so messy it constituted a violation of the city property code. According to Johnson, Anthony Jr. called the sheriff on the worker’s behalf and insisted that the only reason anyone had complained was that they were prejudiced. (Several people I talked to in Sibley assumed Anthony Jr. himself is Mexican, not Portuguese, and he has no doubt experienced discrimination himself.)

The mayor, though, was impressively enlightened when it came to Sibley’s immigrant population. Perhaps because of the Nunes debacle, he invited me to his office to talk to him and the city administrator, Glenn Anderson. “I told him to go see Nunes, and that didn’t go very good,” he told Anderson as we sat down.

Anderson voted for Trump, but he exploded every Trump myth about immigration. The rise in Sibley’s Hispanic population hasn’t been accompanied by a rise in crime. Most of the crime in Sibley is connected to drug-related traffic stops on Highway 60, he said. Kevin Wollmuth, a deputy in the county sheriff’s office, told me that the rise in immigration “doesn’t have any bearing on our crime rate at all.” Worried that the community is underrepresented in city government, Anderson has tried to get the Hispanic population to run for city council, though without much success yet. He had no interest in knowing what anyone’s immigration status was. “If I see something, I’m not going to report it to ICE,” he said. “It’s not my job.” He added, “That’s not to say that everybody in town that lives here is legal. We don’t go knocking door-to-door to say, ‘Are you, are you not?’” He had much the same view of the local immigrant population as Rob Tibbetts, Mollie’s father, who two days before had said at a memorial service for his daughter, “The Hispanic community are Iowans. They have the same values as Iowans. As far as I’m concerned, they’re Iowans with better food.”

Sibley is emblematic of a lot of small towns in Iowa that are dependent on an agricultural economy: They know they cannot survive without immigrants, and they have worked hard to integrate the foreign-born population, despite the legal limbo faced by employers and employees alike. When I asked what would happen if ICE turned its attention to Sibley, the mayor shuddered. Anderson noted that he has never seen an ICE agent in the four years he’s been at his job. He didn’t seem eager to get to know any. “If they come in town, then we have to talk about it, find out what’s going on, why, whether to participate, and make sure our town’s not disrupted,” he said. I asked him what he thought of King’s view that all undocumented immigrants should be deported. He paused and said, diplomatically, “He has a right to his opinion.”

When I walked in the front door of the mayor’s office, I had noticed a mud-spattered white Yukon parked outside. As I was driving to my next interview, I looked in the rearview mirror and noticed the white Yukon again. I drove aimlessly, crisscrossing streets from one end of town to the other. Everywhere I turned, the white Yukon appeared. I was being followed. When I turned the tables and followed the car back, it raced off. We played cat and mouse like that for more than an hour until I finally got a good glimpse of the driver: Itwas a middle-aged woman with curly, red hair who had a cell phone stuck to her left ear. The cat-and-mouse game started to feel a little dangerous, so I left town for a couple hours. On my way back into Sibley, the same car passed me on the highway. This time, the chubby man from the Lantern was driving. He smiled and waved.

Or maybe I’d made a mistake. White SUVs are common. Could I really be sure that was the same guy and the same Yukon? A woman was driving the car earlier; now it was a man. It didn’t make sense. Maybe I was just being paranoid.

I had a particularly sensitive interview that afternoon with a source who I knew would be taking a risk by talking to me about immigration and labor at NuStar. When I arrived, we talked for a few minutes before the source’s cell phone suddenly rang. The conversation seemed strained. “Sí, aquí está,” the source said. I learned that on the other end of the phone was a man named Flavio, who worked at NuStar. Somehow Flavio knew exactly where I was and whom I was talking to. He warned my source to end the conversation. Not only was I being followed, but I was also being watched, and my sources were being contacted by NuStar.

I left and drove to the local grocery store, where I parked in the open, hoping to draw out whoever was tailing me. I suddenly noticed a man in jeans, a work shirt, and a baseball cap pulled down low. He was talking on his cell phone and walking suspiciously. Was he watching me? I held up a camera to take pictures and he darted away. I followed. His car was parked haphazardly on the side of the road half a block away. He got in and took off while I followed. It was a dark Chevrolet Colorado pickup truck—with California license plates. I ran the license-plate number through a database. The car was registered in Tulare, California.

On December 13, 2011, ICE agents raided the home, business, and farms belonging to Mike Millenkamp, a dairy farmer in eastern Iowa. It was the beginning of a seven-year ordeal that would upend Millenkamp’s life. At the time of the raid, he had just four employees. Three of them were undocumented. ICE hauled away his business records, arrested his employees, and launched an aggressive investigation. After sifting through his files, the government said that about three quarters of the thirty-eight workers he had employed over a four-year period were undocumented. Millenkamp pleaded guilty to “illegal alien harboring” and agreed to pay $250,000 in fines and penalties. Despite a relatively clean record, he was sentenced to three months in federal prison and three years of supervised probation, which just ended this past summer.

Prosecutors used Millenkamp to send a warning to other Iowa dairy farmers. As part of his plea deal, they forced him to submit an op-ed to major Iowa newspapers describing his experience. His article, which was preapproved by the local U. S. attorney’s office, appeared in The Des Moines Register on June 29, 2016. “If you employ someone you know is not legal, you are committing a federal crime,” he wrote.

The Millenkamp prosecution seemed unjust—capricious. And it helped explain the reaction I received in Sibley. “That’s why they are so concerned,” Nelson told me when I mentioned that I was being followed and that my sources were being harassed. “They think you are going to mess with their lifestyle or take it away, interfere with it.”

He and I discussed the ethics of reporting on immigration and politics. What if an article triggered an ICE raid? Was there even a story here, anyway? Devin Nunes was the public figure at the heart of this, and he had no financial interest in his parents’ Iowa dairy operation. On the other hand, he and his parents seemed to have concealed basic facts about the family’s move to Iowa. It was suspicious. And his mom, who coowns the Sibley dairy, is also the treasurer of his campaign. In 2007, Devin and his wife, Elizabeth, used the NuStar dairy’s Iowa-post-office-box address on a filing with the SEC regarding a financial holding company the family co-owns, even though Devin and Elizabeth live in California.

And even without the connection to Devin, who is one of Trump’s most important allies, there was a bigger story. The American dairy industry is at the center of an international trade war. Trump frequently attacks Canada for protecting its dairy farmers. “We love Canada,” Trump said on September 18. “They cannot continue to charge us 300 percent for dairy products.” At a hearing on the issue in March, Nunes attacked Canada for “getting away with murder in their dairy industry.” Canadian officials have responded by noting that the American dairy industry is artificially protected by both federal subsidies—NuStar, according to figures based on USDA numbers, has received $140,938 since it started—and its reliance on low-wage, undocumented labor. “The industry itself in the United States has admitted they wouldn’t be viable if they couldn’t use undocumented workers,” a former Canadian trade minister, Ed Fast, recently complained to the country’s Financial Post. The same could be said for much of the broader American agricultural industry—from poultry to meatpacking to grape-picking to cotton—which represents 6 percent of the U. S. economy.

There is massive political hypocrisy at the center of this: Trump’s and King’s rural-farm supporters embrace anti-immigrant politicians while employing undocumented immigrants. The greatest threat to Iowa dairy farmers, of course, is not the press. It’s Donald Trump.

But that’s not how the Nunes family apparently saw it. On my third day in Sibley, I became used to the cars tailing me. In the morning, I was followed by the redhead in the muddy white Yukon. In the afternoon, there was a shift change and I was followed by a different, later-model white Yukon. I stuck a GoPro on my dashboard and left it running whenever I parked my car. When I reviewed the videos, one of the two Yukons could always be seen slowly circling as I ate lunch or interviewed someone.

There was no doubt about why I was being followed. According to two sources with firsthand knowledge, NuStar did indeed rely, at least in part, on undocumented labor. One source, who was deeply connected in the local Hispanic community, had personally sent undocumented workers to Anthony Nunes Jr.’s farm for jobs. “I’ve been there and bring illegal people,” the source said, asserting that the farm was aware of their status. “People come here and ask for work, so I send them over there.” When I asked how many people working at dairies in the area are documented citizens, the source laughed. “To be honest? None. One percent, maybe.”

The source added, “Who is going to go work in the dairy? Who? Tell me who? If people have papers, they are going to go to a good company where you can get benefits, you can get Social Security, you can get all the stuff. Who is going to go [work in the dairy] to make fourteen dollars an hour doing that thing without vacation time, without 401(k), without everything?”

A second source, who claimed to be an undocumented immigrant, also claimed to have worked at NuStar for several years, only recently leaving the dairy, which this source estimated employed about fifteen people. (As a rule of thumb, dairies need one employee for every eighty to one hundred cows, so fifteen workers would be a lean operation given the dairy’s two-thousand-head herd.) The former NuStar employee, who is middle-aged, claimed to have arrived in the United States from Guatemala in 2011. This source was nervous to talk to me and did not want to speculate about the immigration status of fellow employees. “I worked for Anthony for four years,” the source said, speaking in Spanish through a translator. “First milking cows and after that feeding the baby calves.” It was “very hard work,” but the employee and others were “treated well.”

A third source, who claimed to work at a nearby dairy, not NuStar, explained what the local dairy jobs are like. This source claimed to be eighteen years old and to have come from Guatemala two years ago, after paying smugglers $10,000, raised by extended family, to provide transit through Mexico and across the U. S. border. The source said the pay at the dairy was fourteen dollars an hour for milking cows twelve hours a day, six days a week, which, after taxes—the source had provided the dairy with a fake Social Security number—worked out to about $1,600 every two weeks. When I asked how many dairy workers in the area are undocumented, the source replied, “Todos”—everybody.

When I left the interview with the third source, I got in my car and reviewed the GoPro footage. The car had been circled by the newer white Yukon the entire time I was gone. I decided I needed to get out of Sibley for awhile and get some advice about how to tell this story ethically. So I drove to Worthington, Minnesota, to meet a priest.

Worthington is just over the border, less than thirty minutes away. I found Father Jim Callahan at his kitchen table, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and chain-smoking Winstons. Worthington, which is five times the size of Sibley, is a hub for Hispanic immigrants in the Midwest. The influence is unmistakable as you drive down the main street, which is dominated by stores and restaurants that cater to the Hispanic population. More than 70 percent of the students in the local elementary school speak Spanish as their first language. Callahan, whose church, St. Mary’s, conducts Mass in both English and Spanish, estimates that 90 percent of the Hispanic population in the city is undocumented.

Trump’s election was a seismic event here. “Absolute fear” is how Callahan described the post-election atmosphere. “Some people were saying they’re going back. Then we saw spikes in domestic abuse, alcoholism, drug addiction.” In December 2016, he declared St. Mary’s a sanctuary church, which means it shelters undocumented immigrants and protects them from arrest and deportation. “ICE has been active,” he said. “They’re in town two or three times a week.” He added, “But they haven’t targeted farms as such yet.”

I laid out the facts I had uncovered in Sibley, including the intimidation of sources and the Devin Nunes angle, and asked him for advice. “I’d tell that story,” he said. He paused and added, “We’re a sanctuary church, if you need a place to stay. You’re safe here!”

On the way back to Sibley, I stopped at Hawkeye Point, the highest elevation (1,670 feet) in Iowa, and flipped through my GoPro videos and pictures, zooming in on the drivers and cars. I clicked over to Facebook and searched for any Nuneses in Sibley, Iowa. I saw some familiar faces. It all started to click. There was the red-headed woman from the muddy white Yukon; she was Devin’s sister-in-law, Lori Nunes. There was the chubby guy with curly hair from the Lantern who had also waved at me from the same Yukon; he was Devin’s brother and Lori’s husband, Anthony Nunes III. There was the woman from the newer Yukon. I zoomed in on a picture of the car’s license plate: NUSTAR. Not very subtle. The driver was Devin’s mother and campaign treasurer, Toni Dian Nunes. The guy in the pickup truck with California plates was, of course, Devin’s dad, Anthony Jr.

I learned that Anthony Jr. was seemingly starting to panic. The next day, the 2009 Dairy Star article about NuStar, the one that made me think the Nuneses were hiding something and that had led me to Sibley in the first place, was removed from the Dairy Star's website. Anthony Jr., I was told, had called the newspaper and demanded that the editors take the nine-year-old story down. They relented. The article wasn’t captured by the Internet Archive, which provides cached versions of billions of web pages, and it can no longer be found anywhere online. According to someone who talked to him that day, Anthony Jr. allegedly said that he was hiring a lawyer and that he was convinced that his dairy would soon be raided by ICE. (Is it possible the Nuneses have nothing to be seriously concerned about? Of course, but I never got the chance to ask because Anthony Jr. and Representative Nunes did not respond to numerous requests for interviews.)

I hope ICE stays the hell away from Sibley. The immigration system that powers Iowa’s dairies is undoubtedly broken. The dairy owners live with the ever-present fear ofbecoming the next Mike Millenkamp. The undocumented workers live in the shadows and, especially in the era of Trump and zero tolerance, constantly fear arrest and deportation. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress, including Devin Nunes (per his CaRepublican website), have decided that unwavering support for ICE is crucial to their efforts to attack Democrats and help the GOP keep control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections. Naturally, the prospect of passing legislation that would create a guest-worker program for dairy workers who are undocumented—an idea overwhelmingly supported by the industry—is a fantasy in the current environment; Trump, King, and their allies describe such policies as “amnesty.” The Washington debate is completely detached from what is actually going on in places like Sibley.

The relationship between the Iowa dairy farmers and their undocumented employees is indeed fraught. I cringed at the way some of the dairy farmers talked about their “help.” When I asked one dairy farmer, who admitted many of the farm’s workers are undocumented but who also inexplicably claimed to be “very supportive of Trump” and “kind of in favor of his immigration laws,” what a solution would be, this farmer suggested a guest-worker program but compared the workers to farm animals. “It’s kind of like when you bought cattle out of South Dakota, or any place, you always had to have the brand inspected and you had to have the brand sheet when you hauled them across the state line,” the farmer said. “Well, what’s the difference? Why don’t they have to report to the city hall or county office and say we’re here working and everybody knows where they’re at?”

As bad as this paternalistic and exploitative system can be, Nelson and the dairy farmers insisted that most dairies are family-owned and -operated and that the workers, documented or not, often become part of the family. This somewhat cliched view can be overblown and sometimes used to defend an unfair system, but the sentiment helped me understand Brenda Hoyer’s chilling warning to me at the Lantern. During her son’s wake, four Hispanic employees from their former dairy came to express their condolences. They had worked there so long that their children refer to her husband, Gene, as Grandpa.

According to someone he told the story to, Gene received them and thanked them. “I’ve lost a son,” he said to the four men, “but I still have four others.”

WHY IS THIS WOMAN FUNNY?

No one of my friends could understand why I wanted to write about Carol Burnett—not that my friends are so much alike or that they make up a New York group—but Carol Burnett seemed an unlikely enthusiasm for me. Partly, of course, that was because of the sort of man I am or seem to be, but partly it was that even in television terms, Carol Burnett is not what my friends would expect me to watch. My friends liked Laugh-In when it was new, have maybe one violent program they addictedly watch, or they gaze at old movies. (I think movies on television lose an essential part of their glamour: the figures on the screen have to be big, and I have to look up—I think that is in order to reproduce childhood spying, spying on the grown-ups, seeing what the grown-ups, the freed-of-restrictions, the starring souls do.)

Burnett’s audience presumably consists of people in or from small towns, people more poor than rich, less educated rather than more, women more than men, children more than grown-ups—the peripheral, the half-mad, the violent; also, the self-loving, the complacent, the odd, incomprehensible people of Middle America, those who are not in the mainstream of money and power. Only by stretching several points do I fit in with the rest of her audience—if this is her audience, and not simply a New Yorkish view of who watches Burnett—but actually it is a fine audience for a comic, in some ways ... and a dreadful one in others.

The thing about Burnett is that at moments—and not very often—she engages in a kind of total and ruthless, infuriated-at-the-way-some-people-are, peripheral-person’s explosive burlesque, hostile, honest, cold-eyed, like someone saying, “A lie is a lie, and you’re lying.” It is done as comedy from the odd vantage point of a folk performer, as was the work of Chaplin and Fields. When Burnett works in that vein, it seems to me she is gross, demonic, American, and possessed of comic genius.

But Chaplin’s comedy, its use of cannibalism (in The Gold Rush), bullying, alienation, poverty, and the threat of death, was coated with a gentle, self-loving sweetness that becomes more palatable to me as I get older. Fields’s lazy silliness marred everything he did, as well as being, like his essentially passive bitterness—he can barely bestir himself in many senses to act—close to the center of what made him marvelous. At times, he was merciless, not just toward villains but toward women, children, and himself (he was often kinder to the villains than to the women he dealt with): he was often semi-loathsome. Burnett is never self-loving, never lazy, and not particularly passive. She will go farther than Fields—with a woman’s extremism—and be entirely loathsome—but funny.

For me what is funny is something that undoes my sobriety entirely, upsets me, upsets my balance so that I laugh and keep on laughing to the point of pain, and am unable to stop laughing. I realize I got that definition of funny from the movies, from experiencing that kind of laughter at the movies. As a child, I first laughed at the Marx Brothers (and knew, without knowing the word, they represented anarchy: they represented people who did not study, who were not middle-class). Then there was early Bob Hope; in his first movies, so my perhaps defective memory informs me, he was usually frightened, easily gulled by cleverer, more grown-up people—but he kept on wisecracking. I must have been ten years old or so at that point. Then Danny Kaye came along at a time when I was gawky, and he took gawkiness to a point in his early movies where I fell out of my chair in the theatre and lay on the floor laughing. Then there was no one. I thought it was me—and perhaps it was. I was probably more in the mood for Garbo. Then when the glare of romance died down, I started hunting again for that ancient laughter. But Danny Kaye had taken up pathos by then, Sid Caesar had too, and Bob Hope had become, in his comic persona, a prosperous corporation executive, who joked and was a swindler and was apparently semi-impotent with women. There was Lucille Ball: she was the best; she set up enormous contraptions of circumstance, that then trapped her, and I laughed, but the show she did was based on a fantasy of innocence: Lucy lied, stole, envied, did various kinds of harm, but she was always innocent. Innocence, like pathos, is a form of self-pity, is a claim that these things shouldn’t be done to me, and that claim dries up my ability to laugh, even when watching people as skillful as Nichols and May. This is because the sympathy it inspires depresses me, and also because it is unlike the sympathy with struggle and demolition that underlies the hilarity of my childhood and that I still occasionally pursue.

Miss Burnett came in and we were introduced. I am not quite sure why I was scowling. Perhaps her extreme friendliness nettled me.

I cannot remember a single episode of the interminable Lucy series although I must have seen a hundred or more, but I do remember a skit Burnett did five years ago, although I may not remember it correctly—and I may not be able to make it funny.

Burnett came out of a bedroom dressed in rumpled bathrobe; it was clearly early in the morning; and she was either a housewife or a maid: it was something of a toss-up; she had a look of servant’s malice, of taking shortcuts, of no middle-class illusions; on the other hand she had a kind of knotty pride like someone who’d escaped becoming the prey of her husband. She was an unclean winner, and fairly detestable, but it was okay (I thought it was funny) maybe because she radiated a cheater’s determination to survive. She seemed to be a woman of primarily underhanded persistence. It seemed odd and unsettling and funny to me that in this context, a television show, Burnett would pantomime a housewife in that way.

Burnett picked up a basket of dirty laundry, carried it across a frighteningly white, barren kitchen, put the basket down and opened the lid of a washing machine. At that time there was a commercial in which a very muscular, hairless male arm came out of a washing machine brandishing a box of detergent. The suggestion was more or less that a woman could harness the strength of a powerfully built male, could get such a man inside her washing machine to labor for her there. Burnett crammed dirty clothes in the machine, they were tossed out again, and Burnett put them in again, they were tossed out; she peered into the machine, and the strong, hairless, male arm came out, formed a fist, and slugged her in the jaw. She fell to the floor, then crouched there on her hands and knees looking—sickened but enraged—at the hairless arm waving out the opening of the machine; she plotted; she got up and, with a combination of deception, of creeping and swiftness, got the dirty laundry close to the machine (behind her back I think), whipped it into the machine, slammed and locked the lid, and maybe showed a little satisfaction with her dirty pool. Then she turned on the machine; it shuddered; and it began to grow—as in the other commercial. It rose up and up, hit the ceiling, plaster came down. Burnett snarled, I think. Then she shrugged, maybe, and trudged to the sink, opened the window above it, and hundreds of doves flew in, some settled on her hair, on her shoulders; the kitchen was filled with birds; she beat at them; her face became horrified as if at the quantity of guano being deposited not only in her kitchen but all over the world; and she cowered, as anyone would have. She brushed off the last dove, straightened up, looking weakened but not defeated, and she went to the icebox, leaned in, and a huge crown was thrust on her head. She backed out struggling and holding and eating a cracker with margarine on it. Struggling to get the crown off, she has a face of great bitterness. She did get it off; she slung it violently away; and she went back to the washing machine which among clumps of plaster sat there, having returned from its former size. She cautiously tiptoed to it, opened it and, ducking her head, grabbed her clothes out of it and slammed the lid shut again. She went out in the backyard to hang the clothes up, and you heard hoofbeats, galloping, and saw moving past the kitchen window the white Ajax knight, I think. There came a terrible scream. A pause, and then Burnett staggered back into the kitchen, holding a lance that runs through her. And she died.

In a parody of a spy movie that Rita Hayworth did called Gilda, Burnett dances in a strapless black dress with a slit up the side and in long white gloves to signal information with her hips to the Allies. As she dances, something comes over her, and she wig-waggles information with a demonic exhibitionism. When she is shot, she does not die quietly: she spreads her arms, her fingers, and she shrieks, making it quite clear it hurts.

As a nagging slattern whose husband vaguely threatens to hit her, she effortlessly, while chewing on a snack, tears the telephone book in half. Lady Bird, Lynda, and the other one were, in sketches, given the voices of maniacs, sweet but barely in control. Mrs. Nixon with a frozen and imbecilic and supremely tortured smile was a woman of limited intelligence who had become catatonic sometime ago. Burnett seemed to manage to embody the unpleasantness of the world, politicians’ wives, soap-opera pretensions, all of that. Some of her work was quieter and still funny: there have been a number of husband-wife skits of that sort. But her horrors were very special. To some extent they were like George Price cartoons, and to some extent they were like the women in W.C. Fields but done by a woman, placed at stage center, and exaggerated into a ballooning heartlessness. Some people I spoke to said of those skits that they were too shocked watching them to laugh; they were merely aghast. And it seemed obvious to me, she could not go on doing those skits, or ever do many of them on television unless the American audience was a good deal unlike what it is widely held to be.

It seemed especially likely that she would not go on doing this sort of thing when her program was switched from ten p.m. Monday nights to eight Wednesday nights: an earlier audience meant, in television tactics, more sweetness, more amorphousness. The whole thing in fact mystified me: why was she doing this on television anyway? It seemed to me odd that a woman known for her niceness should be doing this at all. I couldn’t believe the American audience would stand for seeing women caricatured and examined in this way, or had the American public grown up at some point while my back was turned? It seemed to me that American comedy fell into two categories: it was either self-pitying, or it was essentially moral, like Burnett’s. But most of what she did was not like the stuff I wrote about above: did that mean of her, let’s say, fifty writers, one wrote that stuff? Did her husband occasionally talk her into doing these things? I didn’t think there would be any direct answers given: if it was, in the opinion of the people working on the show, an advantage to advertise this facet of Burnett’s work, it would have been done by now. Clearly (I said to myself) for television purposes, her image as a nice person is more important to the program’s survival. Anyway, it seemed to me very odd no one had looked into this.

The p.r. man who met my plane in Los Angeles remarked that his accountant said his Cadillac was as cheap for him to drive as a Volkswagen would be. He spoke to me of Miss Burnett’s niceness; he did not mention her comedy. Her particular p.r. man, who is assigned to her show, seemed to have difficulty hearing my questions. He too spoke of her niceness, not her comedy; I asked him about the comedy, and he said, “She still makes me laugh.” We went to the studios to have lunch with Miss Burnett’s husband, Joe Hamilton. We were early and waited in a small office. Miss Burnett came in and we were introduced. I am not quite sure why I was scowling. Perhaps her extreme friendliness nettled me: I do not like to be nudged.

She said, “Hi. We’re going to get together later in the week, Rick says we’re going to have lunch together, I’m really looking forward to it, tell me what you’d like to eat and we’ll have it.” (Rick was the p.r. man.)

We looked into each other’s eyes with what seemed to me the overwhelming truth of our non-acquaintance. I said I did not care what we ate.

She said, in what was perhaps a determinedly friendly way, “There has to be something you’d like—now tell me: we’ll have it….”

I raised both eyebrows and tried to think of what would be easy to cut, that one could eat without paying much attention to it, and that would not splatter. “Hamburgers?” I said.

“Oh good,” she said. She was wearing sneakers. She said, “I’m glad—we’ll have those.” She repeated that she was looking forward to talking to me, and she bounded out.

When she was gone, the p.r. man said pointedly to me, “What did I tell you: Carol’s a real sweetheart. What’s different about her is that she really likes people.”

I said, “You have no idea how unreal all this is to me,” and I sat down to make notes on the above exchange.

Her producer husband, of Joe the Hamilton, show, is who good-looking is the executive in the style of the five best-looking boys in high school—if you went to high school in the early 1940’s. He had an air of decency, no pretensions, no signs of nervousness; he did seem unreachable, inward, well-guarded. He did not look like an educated man. He seemed to be well-ordered and someone I would want to like me—I thought it was unprofessional to want him to like me, so I was stiff and—ah—relentless in manner.

At first, in answer to my questions, he said such things as “We try to do good comedy.” What do you mean by good comedy, Mr. Hamilton? “You can always get what I call a cheap laugh,” he said, “by having Carol pretend to be caught naked in the bathtub: that isn’t the sort of thing we do.”

I asked him if he ever theorized about comedy, and he said no, Carol did it some, more than he, not a hell of a lot, though.

I said I thought some of her comedy was savage. “Savage?” he said. “I don’t think that describes what we do.”

I asked him if he would mind describing his wife’s comedy. He said, “I wouldn’t say Carol was a comedian. She’s an actress who does comedy.” I asked him to define the comedy she did as an actress. Hamilton said, “Well, she can’t just be funny: she has to be a comic character, it’s what the character does that’s funny: it has to be realistic....”

I asked him if “realistic” did not, considering the way the world was, mean being sharp or unpleasant. He looked at me. “That will come out of the character.”

I asked if he would say all her comedy was kind. He said, “We upset some people, we upset somebody all the time. We try to use taste.... You know, I’ve never had an interview like this before.”

I asked him if I could ask him what he thought of other comics—I figured asking him that was giving a sort of comedy Rorschach. He said, “Go ahead.” I said, “Chaplin.” He said, “I don’t really know his work or remember it very well.” Fields: “He was mean, he was very mean.” (And he made a slight face of distaste.) The Marx Brothers: “Groucho was the best—he made it all work.” Bob Hope: “A good joke teller?” Zero Mostel: “Very, very good—but a little too much.” Mort Sahl: “Mort Sahl when he started out was the funniest man in the world.” Streisand: “Funny and unique, but she’s too slow working on something to be funny on television.” Johnny Carson: “I don’t think he is a comedian.”

It seemed to me he liked verbal comedy with some acidity, some anarchy to it, but that he liked his satire well-grounded, that is, not in madness, but in sanity; you can interpret the Rorschach differently if you want to. Certainly, he was no fool.

Then he asked me if I really thought some of his wife’s comedy was cutting. I said I did and that she did this only a small percentage of the time. Then I asked him if he’d ever thought how little self-pity there was in her comedy compared to the work of any other living comic. If, in a slapstick sketch, she fell or was hit, she was not put upon or merely hurt, or sweetly hurt, but she became angry or murderous, or merely ignored the pain. He said, “That’s interesting. I think that’s true—at times. I think I’ve noticed that but I never really said to myself that was what she does. I’m not sure she does it all the time. I partly see what you mean.” He said, “This is a very strange interview…. What else do you want to know?” And he laughed.

I asked her if satire was not often a bit harsh or unkind. She said, “I don’t think it’s unkind—it’s just comedy.”

The next day I went to see the man who is listed as being “supervisor” of the comedy writers; he is also listed as producer of the show.

Arnie Rosen is from Brooklyn. He has dark hair cut short, a dark beard, closely trimmed, and the sad, sharp eyes of a man who has at some time in his life been tormented but has subsequently been soothed.

We talked for a while and then I asked about the savagery that there occasionally was in Burnett’s comedy, where did it come from? Rosen said, “No: that’s wrong. Not savagery. It’s sweeter than savagery.” Then what terms would he use? He said, “Well, maybe Carol would be uncomfortable to think along these lines but we know pretty well, don’t we, that the basis of all humor is cruelty.” He went on, “Good comedy writing means you fit the skit to the performer—to Carol—and to whomever she’s doing the skit with. So I have to qualify what I said. The basis is cruelty but you don’t have to go all out—” What did he mean by cruelty, I asked. “You know, pie in the face, falling on a banana, or a one-word thing: realism. But we do all kinds of humor —not just that.” But you said the basis of all comedy was cruelty. “Well, more or less.” Is the crueler comedy funnier than the other? “I tend to prefer some of the more biting sketches.... I like the nag, George and Zelda, those are indictments. And the Carol and Sis sketches which are really about the marriage between Carol and Harvey—we do some skits where what is dealt with is anger and hostility in the wife....” I said that it seemed he and I looked at the comedy in the same way and he said, “If you say sharp, we’re in agreement, but you said savage.” I said, “Maybe I’m wrong.”

To the, ah, comedy Rorschach, he gave the following answers: Chaplin—“A genius. The father of us all. Great. Very great.” Mae West and W. C. Fields—“I like them. They built good, solid comic characters; Fields was excellent as the likeable villain.” Marx Brothers—“Yes and no: if you talk about the great moments, the peak moments, for those moments yes, a strong yes, I like them,. I admired them, but on the whole, no.” Bob Hope—“Radio, yes. But since then with limited interest.” Red Skelton—“No.” Lucille Ball—“A fine comedienne—as Lucy.”

He said, “I don’t want to knock Laugh-In. What they do is good; but it’s just criticism. They don’t act anything out; they just give lines. We try to reach for the real thing—or maybe that’s too strong: we reach for a reflection of life—a percentage of what we do is that.... I’ll tell you what I think it is: I think a lot of Carol’s comedy is survival-oriented. You take a woman like that, a girl, with the childhood she had, and people, no one ever thought she was a beauty, there’s going to be that survival drive or there’s going to be nothing…. You take a woman, a person, who never shows temper, who knows what outlet there is in the work: who can say? Think what you want to think. I don’t say she does this. Maybe she doesn’t do it consciously but you can think it’s there if that’s the way you like to think. But here is a woman who is very intelligent, very intelligent, and she is addicted to comedy....”

I asked him if a lot of what she did was really his comedy. He said, “Sure, some of it’s me but that’s because I’ve worked with Carol for years.... I used to do the Phil Silvers show, Sergeant Bilko…. To some extent Carol thinks like me now.... We try to keep the characters she does sympathetic—”

“The nag?”

“Well, but everybody’s seen her or knows her or has an aunt like her, and don’t forget that’s not Burnett, it’s a character Carol is playing…. Carol hates to play forceful, mean dames: she has to be talked into it.... You have to remember, this girl is an actress, she can do anything, she’s the most talented performer in America today: she sings, she dances—”

“Not all that well.”

“But well enough for someone who’s as funny as she is. She’s pretty good.”

I asked him if he had to keep the audience in mind: “We have taboos: we’re never obviously cruel, never obviously biased; when she’s in a skit, we try to make it palatable.” I asked him about the giant salami Burnett had carried in a nag sketch and he said, “I think that was Carol’s idea.... She enhances things.” I asked him if she read Freud and he said, “It’s hard to tell what she knows and doesn’t know.... You say we’re savage: I don’t think that’s the word. But when we find a target, maybe there’s a little of the feeling of seek and destroy....” I asked him to give me examples: “The Johnson and Nixon sketches we did were mean parodies.... And the Doris Day one: Doris Day’s son wrote a letter of complaint about that one.... You wouldn’t believe Carol could do Doris Day. She was the distillation of phony virginity. She sang the most syrupy ‘Que Sera, Sera.’ Her cheerfulness was—there are no words for it.... We want to do a Kissinger takeoff with him more concerned with his image as a ladies’ man than with affairs of state. He’s being interviewed by the Burnett character, and his secretary comes in and says, 'Jill St. John is on the hot line….’ Maybe you won’t find that sarcastic but our viewers will…. We’re working on a sketch, a Carol and Sis, where Harvey wakes up in the middle of the night—in a sweat. He dreamed he died, and Carol’s period of mourning was eight minutes; she has an affair with the pilot next door and the lawyer who was Korman’s best buddy…. We don’t hit every time but I wish people would just come out and say this was a good, sharp, incisive, intelligently written show.”

I went to see a run-through of the show for that week. Burnett seemed under-keyed and very much more skillful and sharp in her timing than on television. Some of the physical comedy was very funny, the pratfalls. The same routines on television two weeks later seemed flat, slow, and unferocious.

As she worked, and during the pauses, in the run-through, she was pleasant to everyone, apparently unselfconscious, and she did not seem to arrogate to herself any prerogatives. It seemed to me, however, that her pleasantness was considerably shallower toward some people than to others; it was graded. The p.r. man was sitting next to me, and I murmured to him, “I would like to begin the piece, ‘I dislike Carol Burnett as a person.’ ”

He said, urgently, “That would hurt her very much.”

I was willing to bet the world was largely defined for her by her mind. Survivors trust their minds more than their emotions—you can love unwisely and still love well, but you can’t think unwisely and still think well, or so they are inclined to believe. I knew she said to interviewers that both her parents had been alcoholics, that she’d grown up with her grandmother, that they’d lived in one room in a boardinghouse in Los Angeles. In New York, when no one would hire her, she’d put on a revue with other young people who’d had trouble getting started in show business; as a result she got nightclub work, sang a song called, “I Made a Fool of Myself Over John Foster Dulles.” She sang with such rapacity that she won some recognition at once; she did nightclubs for a while; the man who wrote the song for her works for her now. She did daytime television, and then she was asked to go on for an ailing Martha Raye on a nighttime show, a show Joe Hamilton produced. Miss Burnett learned Miss Raye’s lines and all her comic business in a few hours and said to the p.r. man (he told me), “You’d be surprised how fast you can learn when you’re hungry.” She was a success to the extent that she became a regular on the show she had replaced Martha Raye on. She did an off-Broadway musical called Once Upon a Mattress and engaged in publicity stunts and got the show to Broadway. Then Comden and Green wrote a musical for her, Fade Out, Fade In, another reprise about a girl who becomes A Movie Star. She was a hit, as I recall, but the musical was not; still it ran; but about that time she had married Joe Hamilton, who had eight children from a first marriage; and she hurt her neck or her leg, or both: I don’t remember: she left the show amid rumors of temperament and God knows what all. Broadway brouhaha. She said in interviews then that she'd hurt her neck, she was in pain. There was ill-feeling among the sponsors of the musical who somehow blamed her marriage for her abandoning the show. Without her in it, the show folded. Then she rusticated for a while. She did some television specials which were successful, and about five years ago she began doing her hour-long variety show. Her marriage is reputed to be an exceptionally happy one….

I went to her dressing room. She is not photogenic, and she has a great deal of physical magnetism, which is to say she is attractive. There was about her at first an odd mixture of charisma and extremely careful modesty.

She said, “I’m in awe of you.”

“Don’t be,” I said, crisply. “I’m a bumbler.” (I assumed she was being tactical in her flattery.) I said, “Your p.r. man said if I wrote a piece that began, ‘I don’t like Carol Burnett as a person,’ you’d be hurt— is that true?”

“Yes.”

I asked her why, how could that be? I could be any sort of New York neurotic, or half insane, or someone who loathed her life-style, or have some mysterious purpose that made me not open to her personal worth. She said, “Yes. But you’d met me, you spoke to me: it’s not that you read a book I wrote; when somebody is a performer, it’s themselves they’re offering, and I don’t care what anybody says, it hurts when that’s rejected.” I asked her if she wasn’t used to being rejected by some critics and some people; after all, she was a star and—

She cut in, “I’m not a star. There are only about five stars in the world.” Who, I asked. She thought and said, “Well, there are more than five—I don’t think I want too much to go into that.” She has a pleasant laugh; she laughed. “Do I have to go into it?” I asked her what she meant by star. She said, “Longevity: if I’m still around in twenty years, you can call me a star.” I asked her if she minded talking about comedy. She said, “I know you have very interesting theories about it, and I want to talk about it, I’d be very interested, but to tell you the truth, I’ve never thought about it much.”

I asked her if she had any general, overarching ideas about what was funny, any formulas about comedy. She said, “Well, I think the same things make people cry but different things make people laugh. For example, in a sad thing, if someone dies, everyone is sad, but not everyone finds a pie in the face funny.” What things have you found make people laugh? “So many things.... I don’t know how to put it. A voice—usually a voice, and—I don’t know what to say. I think what it is, is we all laugh about people we know….”

A little later she said, “I know when something is funny because I think, that’s true.... I shouldn’t sound so sure of myself. I think I know when something is funny because I—No. I know when I think something is funny because I think that.”

I asked her what sort of comedy she liked to do, and I think she was, amiably enough, putting me on when she answered, “I never thought about these things before. I’d say mostly satire, comments on human nature, things like that, people’s foibles.”

I wondered if she often used words like foibles. I asked her if satire was not often a bit harsh or unkind. She said, “I don’t think it’s unkind—it’s just comedy.” We talked a bit, and then, wanting to get at what aroused the satirist in her, I said, “Well, let me ask you about the Queen of England: how would you react to meeting her?”

“I guess I’d be thrilled.”

“Would you curtsy? Let me explain. Jackie Onassis, when she was Jackie Kennedy, refused to curtsy, she said it was not for her as an American to do that, and so she shook hands with the Queen.”

“No, I wouldn’t do that. I’d do the other. I’d do it all. When in Rome, I guess. I think I’d hire a teacher and really learn to do the curtsy right. It would be fun to learn, and I’m good at learning things: I’d learn to curtsy very well. I like doing things that are educational, I like to get into things where I don’t know my way around, where I have to learn, where I’m not sure of myself. I don’t know enough. I need an education. I like to be among people and pick things up from life. I—”

“But how would you feel about the affectation?”

“Well, I did the Queen of England once.”

“You did!”

“Canada wasn’t too thrilled.”

“What bothered them?” I thought she’d have to mention the element of caricature.

She said, “My skirt. I had a mini-skirt with the British flag on it, and well, you know, comedy has to be a little exaggerated, it has to be a little left of center or no one laughs—Oh! That’s what you’re getting at. No, no. All it was, was I looked just like her and I—well, they were upset.”

“Was the sketch hard on her affectations?”

“Oh no.... I don’t think so…. But things were exaggerated—to make it comedy.” She smiled and clasped her hands in front of her.

“Have you by any chance met the Queen of England?”

“Me? How would I ever get the chance?"

“Your show is shown in England.”

“You think she watches? I’m not exactly what you’d call a household name in England….”

“What do you mean by left of center, or by exaggerated?”

“I don’t know if this is what you want but what I like is when it’s real, the more real it is, but in a dumb situation—you have to have the dumb situation, and then what I like is the logic.... I go with the logic of that character in that dumb situation.”

“But the left-of-center, and the exaggeration?”

“That’s in the logic.”

“And when you mug, that isn’t exaggeration?”

“I mug if the skit isn’t comfortable for me. Then I might do anything.”

I asked her what she meant. She said she couldn’t do some skits. I told her Arnie Rosen had said she could do anything. “Did he say that? That was nice of him. I can’t, though. I can’t play nervous, frightened people. I hate to play—hate is such a strong word: I don’t like—No. I find it difficult to play, oh, you know, nervous Nellies. Now Don Knotts can do it. But I can’t.”

“Arnie said you prefer to play shy women, that you have to be talked into playing forceful, mean women—is that true?”

“I don't know. I don’t think so. Not as far as I know.”

Her manner had changed but I hadn’t noticed when or why.... I said I’d seen a tape of a sketch in which she played a shy, nervous secretary.

“That was the hardest sketch I ever did! I couldn’t get into her, I couldn’t get near. I didn’t know what to do so I just played Tom and Jerry.”

“What?”

“The cartoons—the Tom and Jerry cartoons: first you do this, then you do that, she does things…. Some of the things she did were funny—lifting the bottle to hit him and there’s no top on it, and it runs all over her head, that was funny I thought, but I didn’t understand that girl.... To tell you the truth, I don’t start with, I don’t work from the inside out: I do everything backwards: I work totally from the outside in—they have to tell me what she looks like, what’s she going to wear, then I figure out how she walks, and if I’m lucky, then I can get inside her and do some good things. I used to feel defensive about working this way but I hear a lot of the good English actors—people like Olivier—work that way, and you can’t say he’s not a good actor. So I’m not defensive about it now.”

“What would you like to do as a performer?”

She said, “I’d like to do hour-and-a-half shows. And movies, of course. I’d like to do movies very much. So I could get into doing three-dimensional comedy —what I’m doing now, I’m lucky if it’s two-dimensional: it’s slash, splut, the thing’s there, or it’s not, and that’s it.”

I asked her why she didn’t do hourlong sketches on her show then, and she said they didn’t write them for her. I asked why she didn’t insist on having them written for her. She said, sort of smiling, “I do what they tell me to do…. And we do longer sketches sometimes: we call them ‘epics’; they run about twenty-five minutes.... I like doing them very much.”

I told her if I seemed rude, she had only to murmur I ought to desist, and I would, of course, but meanwhile, wasn’t it her show, why did she do what “they” told her to do? (I ought also to say that by this point, I showed no disbelief in anything she said; the atmosphere was one of our being friends.) She said she didn’t think it was right to tell people what to do, “And the people who work here know what to do—that’s why we hired them. Why did we hire them if we’re not going to listen to them? You hire people you can work with and who know what they’re doing, and then you’re silly not to listen to them…. They know more about comedy writing than I do, they know what’s possible, what’s not. I’m lucky: I work with good people whom I trust....” I said but after all in the end it was her show, her name, she was the star; she said vehemently she was not a star. I said, “Well, what are you then, how would you describe it?” She said, “I’m successful in show business at the moment but tomorrow I may be gone.... So far television has produced only one real star—Lucille Ball.”

Something in Burnett’s comedy, in her herself, had always struck me as small-town, some note of flat common sense, some element of belief in politeness.

Then I asked her about money (a star=money). She said, “I’m not a good talker about money.... I think all of us in this field are overpaid, way overpaid. Of course…. Those of us in this field who make it, who had nothing as kids, go one of two ways when we get it: they watch every cent, maybe they spend it but they watch it go, they know where every cent is, they think about it. Or they can’t think about it at all, it doesn’t make sense to them; as soon as it’s there, when there’s enough there has to be enough—you have to know it’s going to be there for a while—you like go to sleep, you don’t think about it, you don’t like to think about it. These people can’t handle it, they don’t understand it. My business manager talks to me about money and I try, but I really don’t understand a word of it. I know it’s all in my head but what can I do? Let him put it somewhere and do things with it but don’t tell me about it. I won’t understand anyway. When he talks to me, my head goes blank. My eyes are open but I’m asleep; I don’t hear a word. Once I put my head down like this and snored—he was not amused.”

Along about this point, she asked me if I would like to stick around for the rest of the afternoon; she’d be in and out of the dressing room, we could talk off and on and have dinner later. After that, there was a change in her; she’d jump up and move around, and she didn’t always look at me when she spoke to me. We had had lunch by then—turkey sandwiches. I asked her if she minded personal questions. She said, “Well, let’s try. Try and see.”

I asked her if she minded talking about religion. She said, “No. I was raised as a Christian Scientist, my grandmother was a Christian Scientist—and you know what? There was this idea in Science about never giving up—maybe I got it from there—never having a negative attitude. You know, I’ve told people and it’s true I never thought I wouldn’t make it, it just never occurred to me I might not—that thing I have about not playing nervous, defeated people, I wonder if it came from that? Do you think it did? … I’m not a Scientist now. I believe in God—but a whole religion? That’s too much. I can’t go all that—I don’t think I’m religious anymore. I—that’s all.”

“I’m getting really kind of prying but are you bringing your children up as Catholics?”

“Yes. But more for historical than religious reasons.... You know, you told Joe the characters I played never got defeated, never acted defeated even when they were. I think that was my grandmother. I never once questioned where I was going when I was starting out. I never questioned it that I would get there. You know what else helps you think positively? Psycho-cybernetics.” I asked her if she believed in psycho-cybernetics. She did not stiffen but she said with small silences around her remark, “I like it, yes.” She was, I suddenly saw, not someone who liked to be teased at all, not someone who could bear an inferior position; or I thought I saw it. She is in earnest; she can be playful, I would imagine; but if you tease her or don’t take her seriously, that’s it. She is very intense, I think, about living her life, about enjoying her life. I asked her if she had ever been analyzed. She took on a student’s air and looked at me as if I were a Wise Man from the East. She said, “No.” Then she averted her eyes and said, “I—” Then she said, “No.” And looked at me.

I asked her if she’d read any Freud. She said, “Very little.” I gazed at her. She said, “I should read more of him.” She sounded very, oh, tentatively intellectual. I still looked. She said, “I don’t know much about Freud. I’m really ashamed I don’t read more—” She offered me the last. I said she didn’t have much time for reading. She said, “Oh I have time. I only work thirty hours a week. I don’t read enough good books. I mean to do something about it. But I never get to it—I’m lazy.”

“Would you describe yourself as uneducated? Or stupid?” (She was still closed in from my disinterest in psycho-cybernetics, but now suddenly, she opened up again.) She said, “No. I’m very smart…. But I’m not well-read….” Pause. “I think I’m very, very smart.” I said, “I do too. How much Freud have you read?”

“Some—but not enough that I’d come out and say I knew what he was all about: I read a little and then I stopped.”

“Why did you stop?”

“I think he’s dumb! Well, not dumb, but the things he says about the ladies are dumb. He’s very mean to the ladies, and who needs that.”

“Would you say the Queen of England was affected.”

“She has a different life. I wouldn’t judge her. I’ll stick by what I said earlier—I’d be honored to meet her. I’d learn how to curtsy, I’d practice—I think it’s a hoot to meet different people.” I looked at her but her eyes were fixed on the wall. She said, “I like to go into places I wouldn’t get to go into if I didn’t have this show, I like doing special things that I get to do now, I like to see things I wouldn’t ever have gotten near if it wasn’t for all this: I don’t want to miss any of that. And I learn from those things. I like to see people as I told you, I can learn from people, from what they do, from the things they do, and the things that happen from that. What I like, I really like it, it’s what my education is, I like life to educate me.”

“Do you use what you learn for satire?”

She sat up straight and said, “No!” She looked at me firmly: “I wouldn’t do that….” She looked away. “Maybe some. Not much. Maybe a little. I don’t know … yes. I guess I do. But not coldly. I don’t do it coldly. Never coldly.”

Of the people I know, those who watch her with any regularity have all spent part of their youth in small towns; I was born in a town with forty-five hundred people in it, and grew up in a suburb of forty thousand people. Something in Burnett’s comedy, in her herself, had always struck me as small-town, some note of flat common sense, of flatness, some note of determined democracy, some element of belief in politeness, and so on; but she’d grown up, so far as I knew, in Los Angeles.

I asked her—she was in and out for the blocking—if she minded a little biographical poking around. She said, “No, no. Go ahead. I like the way you come at me.” I glanced at her; she glanced back. I said, “Where was your grandmother from?”

“California. We lived in California.”

“Was she from California originally? Where were her, ah, roots?”

“I—I’m not sure. Arkansas. I think Arkansas.”

Then I asked her what she was ethnically. She said, “I’m not sure. I’m a lot Irish, and I’m part Indian.... I didn’t know my father when I was old enough to ask him who he was so I’m not sure what he was…. My grandmother said my mother’s side of the family, on that side we were Irish and English and there was Cherokee blood…. I think my father was German and French and English—and I think Irish too. I’m not clear about it.”

“You said in an interview that I read that your mother was witty. In what way? I mean what was her wit like? What sort of things did she say?”

“Barbed. She was very barbed. She just peeled away phoniness…. She had a violent temper about those things. She had a violent temper.”

“Do you ever get mad?”

“Not if I can help it ... I do sometimes, I guess, and I get very distant, very sweet-bitchy; everyone starts climbing the walls; I get disgusting. I hate it when I’m like that—I get unattractive…. The thing about me is I always have to be in control—of myself: that’s as a comic too; when I’m working, I have to know what I’m doing.... I can’t work if things are out of control….”

(So her comedy is self-conscious but she uses some set of terms for herself very unlike the terms I used trying to describe what she did.)

“Both your parents were alcoholics?”

“Yes.”

“Do you have any memories of the 1930’s? Like I remember vacant lots and—

“Sure. We were in Texas then, I was still with my parents. There was yellow dust in the streets. I can remember almost everything. Here’s something I never forgot: I was four or five, and there was a boy, he was eight, about eight, maybe seven; and he took me for a ride on his bicycle. I thought it was his bicycle, but what I didn’t know was the bicycle was stolen—he took it from in front of the movie theatre—” I think she said her father ran the movie theatre “—and when I got home, my father was mad, really mad—because I guess he thought I knew it was stolen but I really didn’t. He beat me—on the bottom. I always remembered that. He’d never raised his hand to me before, and I loved him. I loved him very much….”

“Did your mother ever hit you?”

“My mother? Sure. She cuffed me around all day long. She’d give me one for this and one for that, and she’d give it to me like, ‘Here’s one for what you’re gonna do next….’”

“Didn’t you mind?”

“No. She was a mother…. And it didn’t last long.” Then I understood her to say, “When she got bad, she sent me to live with my grandmother.”

“You mean when she knew she was getting worse, getting out of control, she didn’t want you exposed to that violence, she separated herself from you?”

“No. It wasn’t like that. We all lived across the hall, in the same building, my grandmother and us. My father’d gone away then. My grandmother lived across the hall. I just went across the hall at first.”

“But was there a particular reason when you moved in with your grandmother?”

“I don’t think it was clear—it was a thing that happened gradually, no one knew it was happening exactly. It was just that my mother wasn’t there much. My grandmother was very strict. My mother was there less and less.”

“In that interview I read, you were quoted as saying you missed her.”

“Well, I could do things for her now. I could afford to have her treated, to get good treatment, the really good kind, the stuff is there—what else is it good for? Money. I just could do things for her now, that’s all I meant. I’d like to. I’m stronger, I understand more than I did—maybe I could—I just wish she was around now when I—when everything’s—everything’s, well, it’s hardly bad now, everything’s all right, it’s pretty good, and I could help her maybe.... I don’t say I could, I’m not conceited about that, I don’t say I could do anything, that would be conceited, but we could try things. I think it would just be great if she was around—you understand what I mean, don’t you?”

She was called back to the stage for more blocking. While she was gone, I thought about asking questions that would establish some connection or association in her mind between violence and love, being cuffed around and being loved, and then another set of associations of order and the positive approach and so on to survival, but I thought the hell with it.

What it was for me was that I disliked being a reporter in any way that set me at cross purposes to Carol Burnett’s enjoyment of her life.

I was exhausted and seduced, and I liked her a lot. I had sense enough to realize a great many people felt this way about her, and to withhold committing myself entirely, but I did like her, too much to pursue the other thing, or, for that matter, to talk about anything she didn’t show signs of wanting to talk about.

She bounded back in after a while, saying, “You’re making my mind work, Harold. I’m really interested now in this thing about comedy.” (Of course, she knew, by then, I’d been subjugated.) “If you stick around for dinner, by then I’ll know what I think—maybe. But I talked to Harvey while we were waiting around for that dumb dance number to get going—isn’t that a dumb dance number? I really don’t like it. The only thing that would save it is if at the end I’m standing there taking a bow and I get a pie in the face…. And Harvey said comedy always is about hostility, optimism, and never being defeated. He did Chaplin’s walk to show me, and it really was a very optimistic walk. Harvey said comedy was mostly being undefeated: when you’re defeated, it’s tragedy….”

I said no, a lot of modern comedy was defeated: Nichols and May, Lenny Bruce, even Bob Hope. Hope’s comic personage was a corporation man, a thief of petty cash, and his character was entirely determined; a lot of the comedy was that he had no free will, if you put a blonde in front of him, or money, he had to take it, he had to fall. I asked her if she didn’t like the dance number, or if she wanted a pie in the face, why didn’t she have them change the dance number? She’d been listening to my blurred and heavy-handed exposition about pessimism in comedy, and she went on looking at me: “Change it? How?”

“Just tell them to fix it.”

“They don’t listen to me, they don’t pay any attention to me about things like that.” She dropped onto the couch. “And they’re right. I’m wrong a lot: I just think it would be funny to have that dance—you didn’t watch on the monitor? Well, it’s just us being adorable and saying, Here We Are Again, and being just so charming and so sure we’re lovable, and that everyone is glad to see us, and I’d like to stand there at the end being welcomed and—you know—and I’d get a pie in the face—”

“Well, tell them that.” (I had assumed the role of adviser: it is a kind of stupidity that I am particularly given to.)

She said, “I did. They didn’t seem too thrilled.”

“Well, why not insist.”

“How?”

“Throw a tantrum, stamp your foot.”

“No. There’s no excuse—none at all—for temperament.” She made a face. I said it wasn’t temperament, it was quality control. She said, “I think temperament is sick. Look, Harold, I don’t know everything, nobody does, nobody has the right to say, ‘I know,’ or ‘Do this.’ Everybody has to go to the toilet—do you know what I mean?”

“Sure, but don’t you ever protest?”

“Oh sure. I’m not helpless. I’m not a shrinking violet. Me? No. I don’t just stand there….”

“No? What do you do?” (By this time, my manner toward her had become, at least by my standards, sycophantic.)

“Well ... I hate the charwoman bit so—”

“God, I can’t stand it either.”

The kindness with which she looked at me! Oh well. She smiled and said, “See: we agree about some things.” She patted my knee, leaned back, and said, “I told them I didn’t like doing it. What it is with me is that I hated it quasi-philosophically.” I looked at her; she did not grin or anything. She said, “There’s no reason for me dressing up as a charwoman. Of course, it’s very popular, but I don’t think I play it well; it feels dead to me; I feel embarrassed doing it. I don’t know why people don’t notice when I’m dead sometimes. You did, though…. They only set her up as a real character about four times in four years; they gave her four pantomimes to do that I liked. I mean she didn’t just come out and sing, she was part of a skit—do you call it a skit if it’s a pantomime? One that I loved doing, she fantasized herself a burlesque queen—I could get into that. I think when I like things, I do them better. There’s something for me to do dressed in those old clothes, to be her, if she’s going to imagine herself a burlesque queen, but I can’t just use her to ask for sympathy…. What I think is, if I don’t like what they give me to do, or if I can’t get a grip on it, I’m sort of a quitter. I don’t know how to play it and I tend just to walk away from it. I play it but I’m dead in it. I can’t help it. That’s the way I am, and it’s not a good way to be. So I just do those skits the way they’re written but I don’t think I do them right, I don’t bring anything to them, I think they end up just lying there, being very dead. I don’t think I’m the only person in the world who’s like this. I can see in everyone here they’re like that. When they’re turned on by something, things develop. One time when that happened, it was so funny because we could feel it happening, it was so obvious. We were doing a ham-actor sketch, and I was a ninety-four-year-old star or something on her seventeenth, twenty-fifth farewell tour, and I’d fifteen or forty facelifts, and we discovered she couldn’t move her face, she was too afraid it would fall, she didn’t want to say her lines out loud; every line started to feel funny: I didn’t know what saying that line would do to my face and I was so suspicious, so—well, it was funny. And the audience liked it too.”

“My comedy—you go into it too deeply,” she tells me. “...There’s no soapbox to my humor—I like purely physical humor too, you know.”

“Would you say that skit was somewhat sarcastic about, ah—”

“I don’t know. I liked doing it. I don’t always know what’s in a skit. I like doing the stronger comedy, but some skits, you know, that I didn’t think were funny? Well, when we got to the final taping, in front of the audience, they were. They worked.”

“Will you really wait for the final taping to see if a skit is any good, to see if it will work? Isn’t that a considerable chance to take?”

“Oh, we take chances around here every week. You know, I wish I could just let loose and do everything they gave me full out but I can’t. Sometimes I wish I didn’t have to be in control of myself. Sometimes I wish I were another sort of person, but for me control is everything. But I like taking the chances we take: it helps keep the show alive. It keeps us from going stale. You’d be surprised how little I’ve thought about any of this…. I’m really interested in what I’m gonna say…. I’ll tell you the truth that you probably won’t believe, but I’ve only just started going to production meetings. I’ve just begun to express my views.”

“Are you pulling my leg?”

“No. I only started going last year. Also, it was I didn’t want to be pushy. What happened was I woke up one day and thought, I don’t know how the show is put together, I don’t have the first idea, and I asked Joe if I could observe some of the production meetings, and he and Arnie said, ‘You’re welcome to come anytime you want to.’ So I went and now I’m saying more and more—I’m saying what I like to do as a performer, and sometimes it works out in material I feel better with. What I’d like to do is more movie parodies. What I mean is, that I’ve been lucky these last four years that they’ve found things for me to do without my going into it, but I guess what it is, if you don’t throw up because I sound like Goody Two Shoes, is that I’m growing up. I’ve been slow. I can be very slow. I’m not all that confident. I didn’t want to go into it before—to tell you the truth: I liked having it done for me. I was grateful. Whenever I did have an idea—which wasn’t any too often, my friend—they usually liked it, they’d let me do it. Three years ago I had an idea for an epic. There were two songwriters, a boy and a girl—” She has nearly total recall. “The guy was Mel Tormé, and I was the girl. They were both songwriters but their songs were terrible. They were like half songs. They do their songs for Don Rickles but he kicks them out of his office because the songs are so bad. Then they realize if they put their songs together, they’re not so bad, they’re pretty good. So they become a success. It was basically a parody of Dan Dailey-Betty Grable movies. Then the other woman comes on and takes Mel away. He can only write half songs that are terrible again, and some hoods come in to hear the score he’s working on for a show they’re going to back, but it’s terrible, and they push him around. So he goes on the skids. The girl meanwhile takes off her glasses and becomes a singer and a star. She gets to be very famous. Then she’s leaving Ziggy Flofeld’s theatre with some people, and it’s snowing and she’s all dressed in furs, and this guy comes up in rags and begs for a handout. It’s Mel. She says no and he falls flat in the snow, he faints, but we walk away, the snow is falling, then I stop and say, ‘That man looked familiar.’ The camera comes right in to my face, which is busy having memories and feelings as I think it might be that guy. So I turn back and kneel down and lift his head up and look into it very closely; I get closer and closer to it—because I don’t have my glasses on—and then I say, ‘No, it’s not him,’ very matter-of-factly, and I drop his head back in the snow, I just let it go, and I get up and when I walk away I step on his ukulele, the ukulele he sings his songs with to beg with, and I break it.... I gave the skit to the writers, and they liked it, they fixed it up, but mostly they used it as I’d written it…. I guess I did that maybe three times in four years. Maybe I can do more…. What it’s been, Harold, is I’ve been lazy. I haven’t been using my mind. Now I’m starting to go to production meetings and it’s toning my mind up.”

I asked her what she thought of Chaplin: “It’s like what Harvey said: optimistic, undefeated.” Fields: “I feel terrible about this … but he makes me uncomfortable. I saw half of one of his movies once but I left. I have not sat through one whole movie of his so far. I suppose that’s terrible.” The Marx Brothers: “I haven’t seen their movies since I was a child. They scared me. Clowns do that to me too, scare me. Clowns are physically mean.” Bob Hope: she merely nodded. Jackie Gleason: “I don’t know.” Jack Benny: “I like him. It’s so beautiful what he does, the way he sets up things that aren’t funny at first, but when they keep coming back, he makes them funny, and they get funnier: it’s beautifully worked out comedy. And he reacts so beautifully, to what the other characters do. I like that. I admire him.” Nichols and May: “Well, there’s no one like Elaine May. She may be the best. I think her characters are the best acted that have ever been done, so real you just can’t bear it, and then that twist, that going left of center or whatever you should call it, that makes it funny.” Mike Nichols: “I only met him once. He wrote one of the things Julie and I did, and he was there. He was caustic. He scared me.”

The interview got more scattered. She came and went. I asked her, “You said you wanted to do movies?”

“Yes, but the producers, the movie people, they think because you’re in television, you’re some kind of bastard…. You can’t work with somebody who looks down on you. You asked me about temperament a little while ago: I’ll tell you what’s wrong with it—you don’t get good work from people with it, so it wastes money.”

“Would you say you were addicted to comedy?”

“I like to do it—I like it a lot.”

“Marijuana?”

“I never took any, I never needed it, I never tried—I’m not one for drugs.”

“Would you say you’ve gotten pretty much everything you’ve gone after so far?”

She winced. “Some of it. Maybe a lot of it. Yes. I’m not sure. If I say yes, it makes me sound like a pushy person, and I don’t think I am. But I’m very determined. I don’t know what to say.”

“Would you say you were more a realist or a fantasist?”

“I’m a realist but I fantasize. I fantasize a lot. I get inside my head, I get into my own thoughts that sometimes I pass Joe in the hall and he says hello and I don’t even know it’s him, I walk right past him, and then I wake up, and I’ll turn around.” She went out and came back. She said, “It’s interesting to me about comedy. I’ve been thinking and it seems to me what it is with me is the first seasons I was groping, I was finding myself: now I know pretty much what I’m about.” And that was? “I like good, strong comedy.” And that was? “It has to have a fresh premise and be written consistently so I can latch onto the character and it has to be longer.”

“That’s all?”

“That’s how I think.”

A little later, I asked her, “Freud remarked when he was fairly far along that most people were filth.”

“Did he say that? They’re not that bad.”

“Would you say people were more good than bad?”

“Do I have to answer that? Well, there are more good people than bad people, and it’s a shame the bad ones get to a station in life where they can influence people.”

“Then your comedy is about a minority of flawed people?”

“I didn’t say people were entirely good. You asked the question in a statistical way, and I gave you a statistical answer.”

“Do you think people are fairly awful at least at times?”

“It depends. Will you stay for dinner? I’m still thinking about comedy.”

She went out and came back. I asked her if she was willing to be unhappy if that seemed likely to help her do work she thought was good. She said, “You mean a director who made me cry to get a performance out of me? That’s not the way to handle me. He wouldn’t get anything: I’d get stubborn and resist him, I’d get closed in. I wouldn’t be able to react in any other way.”

I said no, I meant would she be willing to be miserable for five years in return for doing work she really admired. She said, “Not if it hurt someone else: there’s always someone else, Harold. Always.”

“But if there was no one.”

“Oh, then I’d do it in a minute.”

I asked her why she wasn’t stubborn about doing skits she didn’t like, but she would be stubborn about being made psychologically uncomfortable. She said, “That’s the way I am—I don’t really understand myself you know.”

At times she spoke in the sentence structure and inflections that I use.

Joe Hamilton came in and said they had decided to cut the dance number. Burnett asked him, “You don’t want to use it and end it with me getting a pie in my face?”

“No. What’s the use: it’s bad material—it’s a piece of shit.”

I said, “Should I write that down?”

He said, “Why not? We talk dirty sometimes.”

I asked him if it wouldn’t be better after a long day if I didn’t go with them to dinner, then everybody wouldn’t have to watch what he was doing. Joe Hamilton said, “We don’t mind being watched. We eat beautifully.”

Eight people went to dinner, six in the Rolls, and Miss Burnett and I went in the Mercedes 280 SL. I didn’t take notes in the car but my memory says she said something like this: “You know, Harold, I’ve been thinking, and what it is, I think you overrate me. My comedy—you go into it too deeply. I wish all that was there but I don’t think it is. I don’t insist on this or that in it, it’s just comedy, there’s no medicine box—no, there’s no soapbox to my humor—I like purely physical humor too, you know, and—”

“But even in slapstick there are always implications, there’s a frame. Your comedy for instance is always about what you think of as good sense—”

“No, no: you put that there. Or Arnie puts it there. A lot of what I do is just silly, is just physical, I like it like that: what I do, Harold, is I go after laughs. I’ve thought about it, and I would like to be the way you think I am, but I’m not there yet. I’m flattered you think I’m good and that you see those things in what I do but I don’t see it.”

“In some of the things you do. Do you remember a sketch you did last year with Rita Hayworth? You were a tourist from the Middle West and you were monstrous, you—”

“I wasn’t. She wasn’t. I see people like that all the time. They come at me —believe me, they’re real. I—”

“I didn’t say she wasn’t real. I just think that at some point you must have said you were going to show a really trampling, egocentric, monster of a woman, and you were going to show what she was like. The voice you gave her was accurate; it was frightening; it wasn’t a funny skit but it was damn cruel and—”

“No, no. I didn’t mean to do that. If that’s what happened, then the skit didn’t work. The skit didn’t work anyway. I remember.”

“But you had a purpose in doing that skit,,,, And in doing the Johnson and Nixon parodies....”

“No, no, I didn’t. I sound funny saying I didn’t, but I didn’t. I just did them. I don’t think what you see is there. There may be a lot of things I don’t like but I don’t think that ever gets into the comedy.”

“You don’t think it’s possible that the temper you never show has an outlet in the comedy you sometimes do?”

“I don’t think so. I don’t know about things like that. When the comedy’s good, it feels good and that’s an outlet. Maybe what you say does happen, but I think that leaves out the purely physical things I do. Remember: I like physical comedy.”

“But gestures are language. And they’re usually violent in comedy and they say things about good sense and fairness and—”

“If that’s there, I’m glad. But I didn’t put it there. It just happened, Harold. Honestly.”

As Joe Hamilton had said, he and Carol Burnett ate well, or rather ate nicely. Burnett made a reference to “Fred and Marge” and explained they were imaginary viewers in Nebraska or Alaska who knew everything about television and the machinery—splicing, superimposed camera shots, dubbing, all of that. She described Fred watching a show and saying, “That’s a beauty: Marge, did you see that tape splice?” Marge says, “That third camera is a slowpoke on the zoom lens, isn’t it, Fred?” I asked her if she intended doing a Fred and Marge skit. She said, “No. Uh. Fred and Marge wouldn’t get it….”

On the way back to the studio, she said, “I’d like to be the sort of tough comedian you have in mind. Maybe it’s there sometimes. I think I’m honest about things. I think I know what I’m doing—you’re just not right—yet. I’m going to try more things this year. But I’m realistic about what we can get, on a weekly show. We’ll see. It was nice of you to think so seriously about what I do. I appreciate it. I just don’t think you have things quite right just yet….”

At her dressing room, she said, “Don’t go. Ask some more questions. I’m not tired.”

“I am. I’m worn-out. I’m going home.”

She hesitated, came toward me, lifted her arms, and put them around my neck. I put my arms around her, hugged her, patted her. Anything she would have cared to ask me, I would have done, but she didn’t ask anything. I said, “Well, good luck. The best of luck.” She nodded. On my way out, I bumped into Joe Hamilton, and we shook hands. He said, “It was the strangest damn interview I ever had. You did more talking than I did.”

“Yeah I know. But don’t tell anyone,” I said.

The next morning, I telephoned Arnie Rosen. He said, “How do you feel?”

“Exhausted, seduced, admiring.”

“What did she say?”

“A lot of this and that but no direct statement about satire, or any of that.”

“No? Too bad. But she’s a very guarded woman.”

“She struck me as being ferociously intelligent.”

“Well, that’s it. She is. And when you’re that much smarter than anyone who’s ever been near you, you have a lot of caution.”

“Well, thanks a lot.”

“Next time you’re out, call.”

“I will.”

It seems to me it makes sense that: someone like Carol Burnett might not want to play the role of public (and part-time) moralist or Occasional Genius or any public role except the one she thinks most productive and most protective for her. If she wants to be taken merely as a performer, that’s fine with me. At dinner, I asked her if she remembered doing a skit about television commercials and she said, “Oh, did you like that? Joe and I wrote it….” A woman might not want to go all out with a talent and material basically violent, concerned with and focused on betrayals of various kinds. Why should she? I watch her program and think as I sit through the harmless stuff, the dull stuff, the okay, empty stuff that she’s happy, and I wait for the other order of stuff. Those moments when she gets around to demolition. They’re something.

They really are.

EL FINAL DE 'ANIMALES FANTÁSTICOS: LOS CRÍMENES DE GRINDELWALD' EXPLICADO

ADVERTENCIA: CONTIENE SPOILERS DE ANIMALES FANTÁSTICOS: LOS CRÍMENES DE GRINDELWALD (obviamente)

Una vieja máxima de ficción establece que una casualidad te puede meter en problemas, pero no te puede sacar de ellos. Recuerda esto porque es importante. Luego volvemos a ello. Desde que el pasado 16 de noviembre se estrenó Animales Fantásticos: Los crímenes de Grindelwald, todos los fans que ya han visto la película se han llevado las manos a la cabeza (alguno que otro al denominado 'sobaco' del codo) cuando al final se revela la, según Gellert Grindelwald, verdadera identidad de Credence Barebone: Aurelius Dumbledore, el presunto hermano de Albus Dumbledore, Arianna Dumbledore (1885-1899) y Aberforth Dumbledore, y también presunto hijo de Percival y Kendra Dumbledore. Porque aquí lo de presunto es importante. Hasta ahora, que se supiera, sólo había tres hermanos Dumbledore. Y sabíamos del trágico destino de esta joven bruja, y del horror que vivió a la edad de seis años cuando fue atacada por tres niños muggles, según cuenta Albus Dumbledore en Harry Potter y las Reliquias de la Muerte (Salamandra).

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

Que su parentesco es una mentira urdida por Gellert Grindelwald para confundir a la ya de por sí atribulada mente del joven Credence, está claro: quiere que se enfrente a Albus porque su poder es mayor, y eso de mentar a la familia siempre funciona, sobre todo si vas encizañando por el camino. Lo que choca es que haya un polluelo de fénix rondándole a Credence (ya sabes que los fénix rondan a la familia Dumbledore cuando están en peligro, pero también a aquellos . Pero eso también puede ser una creación, un encantamiento de Gellert. Porque ya sabemos, después de haber visto Animales Fantásticos 1 y 2, que es un manipulador (o es que ya nos habíamos olvidad de Percival Graves: este tío tiene un plan, desde hace tiempo). Eso es lo que nos cuenta la película. Pero, ¿por qué es tan fácil determinar que es una mentira? Vamos a exponer nuestro caso.

Prueba número 1

Cuando Grimmson está hablando con Grindelwald debajo del puente dice que "mató a la mujer", como si esa fuera la orden. Por mujer nos referimos a Irma Dugard, el ama de llaves que se encargó de velar por los hermanos Lestrange y viajó con ellos a Estados Unidos. Si se lo podía haber contado ella, ¿para qué matarla? No tendría ningún sentido.

Prueba número 2

Antes de entrar en ninguna teoría sobre si Credence no es hermano, pero puede tener otro tipo de parentesco dentro del árbol genealógico de la familia Dumbledore, su edad, sencillamente, no cuadra. Si no estamos equivocados, Percival Dumbledore fue condenado a Azkaban y falleció allí, como sabemos por Harry Potter y las Reliquias de la Muerte), exactamente un año antes del primer año de Albus en Hogwarts. El funeral de su esposa, Kendra, tuvo lugar después de que Dumbledore se fuera de Hogwarts cuando solo tenía 17 años... Vamos, que de fechas, Gellert anda flojeras.

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

Como sabes de sobra, además, en el obituario de Elphias Doge a Dumbledore en El profeta, no hay ni una sola referencia a un tercer hermano.

Prueba número 3

Todo lo que nos quería revelar J.K. Rowling sobre Albus Dumbledore lo volcó en Harry Potter y las Reliquias de la Muerte, en general, y en el capítulo King's Cross, en particular. Algo con un peso como que tuviera un hermano que fuera reclutado por Gellert, su medio pomelo, que se enfrentara a él y que terminara Ahí Harry, y nosotros, aprendemos que Albus no es el mago tan perfecto que él pensaba, que su mayor enemigo, al final, era él mismo. Como ha explicado Rowling, "para convertirse en un gran mago, Dumbledore tenía que saber lo que significaba ser uno malo".

Avergonzado, y con lágrimas en los ojos, Dumbledore le cuenta a Harry que había sido un tonto joven egoísta, y cómo él, "atrapado y desperdiciado", se dejó seducir por el brillo de Grindelwald y el poder de las Reliquias de la Muerte. Porque sabemos que hay un momento en el que Dumbledore y Gellert quieren los dos un mundo en el que los muggles se vuelvan sirvientes de los magos, que Aberforth se opone. Sabemos también que quieren que Arianna, poderosa, se una a ellos, que Aberborth se opone, que hay una lucha mítica y que Arianna muere. Y no se sabe quién la mata de los tres. Está claro que en las siguientes películas veremos todo esto, porque todavía queda hasta que lleguemos a las guerras y que Dumbledore derrote a Gellert.

Entonces, ¿quién es Aurelius Dumbledore?



O mejor dicho, porque esto, hasta que no avance la trama, es pura especulación: ¿Quién puede ser? Vamos a repasar las tres teorías que más están sonando.

Teoría 1

Como ya ha comentado el 99,9% de los fans a la salida del cine Credence podría ser el Obscurus de Ariana. Después de la muerte de Ariana, su Obscurus fue a vivir en el cuerpo de Credence. Eso explicaría por qué Grindelwald dice "Tu hermano"; está hablando con el Obscurus, no con Credence. Lo de Aurelius lo dice para confundir.

Teoría 2

Otra teoría más chunga dice que más que hermano, podría ser hijo de Ariana, y, por tanto, sobrino de Albus. A ver, que sería algo retorcido, por edad es biológicamente imposible, y no creemos que esta saga se meta en algo tan cruel, pero la teoría ahí está. Recuerda que tres jóvenes muggles le hicieron cosas horribles a Ariana (de lo que más tarde Percival, el padre de Albus, se vengó).



Ya hemos puesto las pruebas sobre la mesa para justificar la mentira, y dos teorías que ofrecen alternativas (en Esquire.es, nos sumamos al 99,9%, lo que no tiene mérito, pero lo dejamos de cara a la galería), así que ahora toca recuperar la frase del principio. Habrá gustado o no el final, habrá convencido o no, pero sin lugar a dudas no está puesto porque sí. Cualquier casualidad en ficción es lícita si luego se resuelve con gracia. Si JK Rowling no utiliza otra casualidad para resolver la identidad y el origen real de Credence y su peso dentro de la nueva-vieja saga, habrá merecido la pena. Solo hay que tener paciencia. Además, sacar a los fans del canon no está mal de vez en cuando.

CONEXIÓN VUITTON: SIETE DÍAS, CUATRO DESTINOS Y UN RELOJ

Se acercan las fechas más esperadas/temidas del año. Las luces están puestas en las calles, el turrón disponible en las tiendas y hasta te ha parecido oír ya algún villancico en el trabajo. Jingle Bells, jingle bells... es difícil escapar de la Navidad pero no es tan difícil hacer una escapada navideña si te lo organizas bien.



En Esquire este año contamos con la inestimable ayuda todo un Phileas Fogg del siglo XXI. No tenemos 80 días (ya nos gustaría) pero en tan solo una semana somos capaces de visitar cuatro destinos sin perdernos nada con la ayuda de las City Guides, la aplicación más viajera del smartwatch Tambour Horizon de Louis Vuitton.

Desde hace más de un siglo, Louis Vuitton ha sido el equipaje preferido para los viajeros más exigentes y ahora, gracias a su reloj inteligente, hace un poco más fácil descubrir los secretos de las principales capitales del mundo. El reloj Tambour Horizon ofrece dos funciones: 'Cerca de mí', que nos muestra sugerencias de los mejores lugares dependiendo de su ubicación actual, y '24H IN', que nos ayuda a planificar el viaje con antelación. Ponemos a prueba esta aplicaciones y otras funcionalidades del Tambour Horizon en un periplo navideño desde el día 25 a la Nochevieja. Prepara la maleta que nos vamos...

DÍA 1 - 25 de diciembre: MADRID ✈️ PARÍS.

Hemos sido muy buenos y Papa Noel nos ha traído una Tambour Horizon de Louis Vuitton que vamos a comenzar a disfrutar desde ya. Tras los brindis con la familia, configuramos todos los ajustes del reloj e introducimos nuestro primer vuelo para comenzar esta odisea navideña. Primer destino: París.

Esquire / Blanca Cortés

MADRID Barajas - PARÍS Orly

Tiempo estimado de vuelo: 2 h y 5 min.

Salida: 9:35 am

Llegada: 11:40 am (hora local)

Compañía: Iberia

Precio aproximado: 150 euros (fuente Trabber)



Para tener todo controlado elige como primera opción la esfera 'My Flight'. Esta aplicación permite controlar todos tus itinerarios desde semanas antes de comenzar el viaje y hasta el aterrizaje. Unas horas antes de la partida del vuelo, la esfera te mostrará el tiempo restante hasta el despegue, la terminal, la puerta de embarque, el asiento, el tiempo que dura el vuelo... todo lo que necesitas en tu muñeca.

Llegamos a París para descubrir si es cierto que sigue siendo la Ciudad de la Luz. Nos adentramos por Viei­lle du Tem­ple en el barrio de Marais y vamos a ver la iluminación navideña del Centre Pompidou y la Place Vendôme, dos de los sitios más espectaculares. Aunque si hay un lugar que nadie se puede perder es la Pla­ce la Con­cor­de, para tomar un poco de vino calien­te con espe­cias mientras buscamos un recuerdo navideño en el tradicional mercado.

Nuestro Tambour Horizon avisa, mañana tenemos otro viaje que hacer...

Día 2 - 26 de diciembre: PARÍS 🚆 LONDRES

No madrugamos, que estamos de vacaciones, pero vamos a hacer una travesía que seguro que a Phileas Fogg y Jean Passepartout les hubiera encantado: cogemos el tren de París a Londres por el Eurotunel.

Tiempo estimado de viaje: 2 h y 17 min.

Salida: 12:13

Llegada: 13:30 (hora local)

A muchos les sorprenderá este viaje express a Londres pero tenemos un buen motivo: vamos a ver un partido de fútbol. La mayoría de las ligas europeas "cierran por Navidad" pero en la Premier no descansa. Nos vamos a ver el Tottemhan - Bournemouth en el mítico Estadio de Wembley. Tras acabar el partido, y siguiendo la tradición, nos dirigimos a tomar una pinta a uno de los templos del mundo del balompié, la Freemason’s Tavern. Ahí, once delegados de diferentes clubes londinenses decidieron un 26 de octubre de 1863 las 13 reglas básicas del deporte rey que hoy conocemos como fútbol.

Hemos echado la tarde y pedimos ayuda a nuestro Tambour Horizon, ¿dónde podemos ir a cenar rápido? La aplicación 'Cerca de mi' nos recomienda hamburguesería Shake Shack. No os olvidéis de pedir sus famosos patatas. La mejor manera de ir haciéndonos a la idea de lo que nos espera en nuestro próximo destino...

TODO LO QUE DEBES SABER DE LA FILOSOFÍA DEL TRASH.

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

Asignatura obligatoria en la carrera de la vida, la forma más fácil de iniciarse o reforzar la filosofía Trash es escuchar las palabras de su máximo ideólogo, el cineasta John Waters.

Nacido en Baltimore el 22 de abril de 1946, conoció a Glenn Milstead en la tierna infancia. ¿Quién es Gleen? La gran musa de Waters, la excelsa Divine, que forma parte de su equipo habitual conocidos como los Dreamlanders. Para ser uno de ellos, debes saberte de memoria los diálogos de Los asesinatos de mamá, Hairspray o Cry-Baby, pero sobre todo Pink Flamingos.

Además de director, John Waters es un excelente escritor: os recomendamos encarecidamente Majaretas (16,15 euros en Amazon.es) donde los artículos «101 cosas que odio» o las «101 cosas que amo» son dos básicos en la historia de la humanidad. Todo sin exagerar.



Y por sí, por si te queda alguna duda, Divine se comió una caca de perro.

DIEGO LUNA, ESTRELLA EN 'NARCOS 4', NOS HABLA SOBRE LA GUERRA CONTRA LA DROGA EN MÉXICO

La última vez que estuvimos en el mundo de Narcos, al fin y al cabo nuestro mundo, fuimos testigos de como el agente de la DEA Javier Peña (interpretado magníficamente por Pedro Pascal) colgaba para siempre sus botas en la lucha contra el crimen. Había muchas razones para decir adiós a la serie: Pablo Escobar había muerto, los carteles de Medellín y Cali habían sido vencidos y el imperio de la cocaína de Colombia se había convertido en polvo. Pero no hubo sensación de victoria, no existió un paseo hacia la puesta de sol para un agente heroico, solo la silenciosa aceptación de que la llamada "guerra contra las drogas" con la que había estado luchando es algo interminable, en parte porque sus propios jefes en el gobierno de los Estados Unidos al parecer no tenían interés en acabar con ella.

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

Esa sensación de inutilidad es palpable en todo Narcos: México, que ya está disponible en Netflix, lo que hace retroceder la línea de tiempo de la serie hasta 1980 para ilustrar cómo comenzó todo. Diego Luna interpreta a Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, fundador del Cartel de Guadalajara y ex jefe de un tipo al que quizás hayas visto últimamente en las noticias. Persiguiéndolo está Enrique "Kiki" Camarena (Michael Peña), un agente de la DEA en un momento en el que, como indica la serie, había más mujeres en la policía de Nueva York que agentes en la DEA. A medida que sus caminos se cruzan, es más sencillo darse cuenta de quienes son los beneficiarios reales del mundo subterráneo del narco, en ambos lados de la frontera.

Es la temporada más mordaz de la serie hasta ahora. Y para Luna, que nació y creció en México, la historia es fea, pero importante.

"Tenemos que hablar de este período de tiempo", nos comenta. "Es crucial entender por qué estamos leyendo hoy lo que estamos leyendo".

Luna habló con Esquire acerca de interpretar al "Rockefeller de la marihuana", de cómo las drogas y la violencia han cambiado su país y qué se necesita hacer para solucionarlo.

Inicialmente se mostró reacio a aceptar el papel

Es uno de esos momentos en que mi primer impulso como actor es decir que no. Salgamos de esto, escapemos lo antes posible incluso antes de que lleguen a un acuerdo. He visto fracasar muchos esfuerzos para contar la historia de estas personas. Tienes una responsabilidad aún mayor, porque detrás de estas historias hay mucha pérdida y dolor. Estás hablando de personas que vivieron hace 30 años, no hace mucho. Pero el productor ejecutivo Eric Newman me dijo: "Tu voz es importante". Y cuando me di cuenta de eso, y de que iba a tener la oportunidad de estar realmente involucrado en lo que estábamos haciendo y en la historia que contábamos y su importancia, dije: "Está bien, me uniré".

No fue fácil encontrar información sobre Félix Gallardo

Al crecer en México, tienes a Caro Quintero, tienes a Amado Carrillo, tienes a El Chapo, todos estos nombres, estos personajes que la gente cree que conocen mejor que nadie. [Gallardo] era un tipo mucho más discreto... Él entendía el valor de la discreción. Fue genial tener que regresar e investigar para saber exactamente quién era.

Ve a su personaje como otra víctima en la guerra contra las drogas

Para mí, la parte más importante de recrear un personaje es pensar en el contexto en el que vivía y tratar de comprenderlo. Es muy importante no hablar de las cosas como si fueran blanco o negro, ya que la retórica nos está llevando a un mundo muy polarizado. Nadie es solo "malo": amor, celos, ambición, arrepentimiento, todas esas cosas están ahí y tienen razones, puede que no estés de acuerdo con ellas, pero como actor tienes que entender esas razones para representar a un personaje. También entiendes que en esta serie, el protagonista no es Kiki Camarena, yo no soy el protagonista, el protagonista de esta historia es la cocaína, y cómo te llega la cocaína y el sistema aquí creado. Son víctimas de este sistema.

Culpa a la militarización de empeorar la violencia en México

Lo principal que me viene a la cabeza de la recreación de México en los años 80 es la tristeza al recordar lo libre que era México en el que crecí y cómo no es el México en el que crecen mis hijos. Ha cambiado por culpa de toda esta violencia, por culpa de todo este tiempo en el que ha ido aumentando la violencia, y en los últimos 12 años desde que [el ex presidente mexicano] Felipe Calderón decidió declarar una guerra frontal contra el narcotráfico en México. Las cosas se descontrolaron porque no había una estrategia detrás todo ello, y es claramente una guerra que todos estamos perdiendo. Me entristece mucho tener que aceptar que ese es mi país.

Las drogas deben ser tratadas como un asunto de salud pública

Pensamos: "Oh, los narcotraficantes son violentos porque están poniendo drogas en nuestros bolsillos". No, es al revés. La batalla es sobre la demanda. Hay un mercado gigantesco en todo el mundo, en los Estados Unidos, probablemente el más grande, y en el momento en que hay un mercado, habrá un proveedor. Tenemos que ver esto como un problema de salud. Y tan pronto como comencemos a hablar de la demanda, podemos comenzar a aceptar que es un problema que nos incumbe a todos porque el mercado está en todas partes. Si no intentamos arreglarlo juntos, nunca lo arreglaremos.

Dada la actual tensión fronteriza, esta temporada es ahora especialmente importante

Una cosa para mí que está clara es que hay delincuentes que participan en ambos lados. Y tenemos que aceptar eso. Tenemos que aceptar que, para que esta estructura exista, todos los niveles de poder están involucrados, y esta corrupción ha llegado a ambos lados de la frontera. Deseo que cuando termine la serie, la gente comience a preguntarse: "¿Por qué los niños pequeños en países como México están dispuestos a unirse a estas organizaciones?" ¿Qué los empuja allí a hacer eso? Porque si comenzamos a analizar el problema desde una perspectiva diferente, somos parte del problema.

LOS 10+1 MANDAMIENTOS PARA TRIUNFAR COMO INFLUENCER EN INSTAGRAM

1 José Lamuño

@jose_lamuno

Profesión: actor y modelo



"Al final creamos un mundo a nuestro alrededor y la gente empatiza con él. Hay que intentar ser lo más natural posible, pero obviamente mostramos lo que queremos que la gente vea de nosotros. Lo comparo con un alter ego: tu instagram es como tu alter ego en el que creas una especie de lifestyle que refleja cómo ves tú la vida: con qué filtros la ves, qué actividades te interesan… Muchas veces nos meten caña diciéndonos que debemos ser más profesionales, imitarnos los unos a los otros… Pero yo soy esto. No soy ningún experto en fotos o alguien que marque tendencia en moda. Yo explico lo que veo y lo que me gusta sin pretensiones y tengo la suerte de que la gente lo sigue y recibo mucho cariño. La foto que más lo petó fue una que subí con Ana Guerra cuando grabamos el videoclip de Ni la hora, con un alcance de más de un millón de personas".

¿SE PUEDE CONVERTIR JASON MOMOA EN EL NUEVO DWAYNE JOHNSON?

Esto es como cuando ibas y decías: ¿Quién ganaría en una pelea: Thor o Hulk? Y llegaba Stan Lee y decía que estaba claro que Thor, pero tú llevabas leyendo los tebeos tanto tiempo que no lo tenías tan claro, y los nuevos fans de Marvel tampoco lo tienen ahora que se han encariñado con el Gigante Verde hasta tal punto que un dios de la mitología nórdica se la trae al pairo y aplauden, con lágrimas en las córneas, cuando Hulk le da lo suyo al hijo de Odín en Thor: Ragnarok.

El actual podio de héroes de acción tiene ya a su Odin particular, un tal Tom Cruise. A su derecha está Will Smith. Luego tiene a actores de arte y ensayo que nadie esperaba que fueran héroes, estilo Benedict Cumberbatch. Tiene a jóvenes promesas, nivel Tom Holland (que ha conseguido lo que Tobey Maguire o Andrew Garfield no consiguieron). Hay clásicos maduritos, como Daniel Craig, Jason Statham, Idris Elba o Robert Downey Jr. También hay tipos que nunca habrías pensado que eran héroes, como Matt Damon o Keanu Reeves o Ben Affleck. Ah, y a clásicos más maduritos todavía, como Liam Neeson, que reparte más que MRW y ASM juntos. Y tiene a fortachones que actúan, como Dwayne Johnson, una categoría en la que no había competencia, hasta ahora. (Y John Cena no cuenta, que él ha sido llamado para la comedia. Y tampoco Vin Diesel, que rueda acción, pero es más cómico que héroe de acción. ¿Cómo que no has visto Las crónicas de Riddick? Te estás perdiendo una de las mejores comedias del siglo XXI.) Porque a Johnson le ha salido una seria competencia: Jason Momoa.

Así que la pregunta es obvia: ¿Se puede convertir Jason Momoa en el nuevo Dwayne Johnson?

A Jason Momoa todavía le queda un largo trecho hasta conseguir su propia entrada en la Enciclopedia Británica, porque, señoras, señores, Dwayne Johnson, the Rock, tiene ya su propia entrada. Uno es una leyenda de la WWF con un década a sus espaldas en Hollywood como héroe de acción y el otro es un aspirante a héroe de acción (porque Conan, y no es culpa de Momoa, es tan difícil de ver que no cuenta), después de haber enseñado la patita en Justice League -de hecho junto a Gal Gadot es el único que se salva de la película- y a la espera del resultado de Aquaman, que pinta bien y que podría convertirle en una nueva estrella. Juzga tú mismo el trailer final de Aquaman, en cines el 21 de diciembre:

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

Los dos han recibido de lo lindo por sus actuaciones. Los dos son algo más que músculos. La rivalidad, por supuesto, es imaginaria. Es la reedición de la pregunta de los 90: ¿Y tu de quién eres: de Arnold Swzarzenegger o de Sylvester Stallone? Nos referimos a los años pre-quirófano de ambos, cuando el segundo salía en Tango & Cash y Alto o mi madre te dispara. Con uno acabó la política, y con otro, mala decisión tras mala decisión a la hora de aceptar guiones.



La respuesta podría ser que todavía es pronto. Momoa se está tomando su carrera con calma, aceptando papeles de acción para los que se busca un tipo más duro que la media, pero un pelín menos duro que Johnson (para que te hagas una idea: si el brazo de Johnson son como cuatro brazos del redactor que esto firma, el de Momoa son tres, y hay películas que requieren actores de tres brazos).

Momoa está tejiendo una sólida carrera en series, y no nos referimos a su papel en Juego de Tronos como el jefe bárbaro Khal Drogo, que, si lo piensas, es un cameo efímero más que un papel en serio, sino, antes, en Stargate Atlantis, como Ronon Dex, y después en Frontier, una pedazo de historia sobre tramperos y despiadados empresarios del siglo XVIII en la bahía del Hudson, y The Red Road (su personaje, Philip Kopus, es de lo mejorcito de la serie). Y, no, no tenemos en cuenta sus 38 episodios de Vigilantes de la playa, que en algún sitio hay que empezar.

Visto cómo elige los papeles parece que Momoa tiene dos planes:

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

1. Plan A. Doy la campanada en un blockbuster tipo Justice League, tipo Aquaman, y eso me abre la puerta a grandes papeles de acción. Quiero hacer The Crow, pero no tengo prisa (y no pasa nada porque no salga). Venga, me atrevo con Aquaman, que mira que había que apostar cuando dijo que sí (porque decirlo ahora, que se ve que la jugada va a salir bien, tiene menos mérito).

Lionsgate

2. Plan B. Yo sigo eligiendo los papeles que me gustan, tratando por todos los medios de no encasillarme, de tal forma que si no doy la campanada, al menos voy a actuar en cosas que me gustan.

El Plan A explica que actuara en Conan, o en Vigilantes de la playa, la película, o que entrara en Justice League, cuando las películas de DC no tenían muy buena prensa, que aceptara un secundario en Desaparecido en Venice Beach (Once Upon a Time in Venice). El Plan B explica todo lo demás.

En el departamento de Quién Es Más Fuerte de Esquire creemos que para convertirse en el nuevo Dwayne Johnson de Hollywood, Momoa tiene que superar estos cuatro retos en la gran pantalla:

1. Primer round: Que Aquaman funcione en taquilla. A ver qué pasa: hemos leído el argumento, hemos visto fotos, ha salido ya el trailer (bueno cien mil trailers) y funciona.

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

2. Segundo round: Salvar a su familia, en el cine. Todo gran héroe tiene que pasar este mal trago. A Dwayne Johnson le tocó El rascacielos. Ahora le toca a él. Porque si hay algo mejor que un rey es un héroe: para su pueblo y para su familia.



3. Tercer round: Hacer de policía, agente del Gobierno, soldado en activo o retirado... y salvar al mundo. Es un clásico. Sin eso no hay héroe.

4. Cuarto round: Participar en una película apocalíptica... y, también, salvar al mundo. A ver qué tal le sale la jugada con la serie futurista de Apple Studios que dirige Francis Lawrence, responsable de todas las entregas cinematográficas de Los Juegos del Hambre), y escribe Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things y Peaky Blinders).

Como clave las cuatro, gana por KO en el cuarto asalto.

A ver, que la pregunta también podría ser: ¿Quiere? Y con eso zanjamos el asunto.

QUÉ PUEDE HACER UN CHAMPÚ ANTICAÍDA (DE VERDAD) POR TI

Antes de gastar dinero a lo tonto, poner todas nuestras esperanzas en ciertos productos y confiar en los champús para preservar nuestro pelo, deberíamos informarnos sobre lo que nos pueden dar estos y lo que no.

Las campañas de marketing hacen su labor y nos empujan con todo su arte a meter en la cesta de la compra todo tipo de lociones, ampollas, jabones con la intención (o eso creemos) de conservar nuestro pelo durante más tiempo e impedir su caída.

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

Pero nosotros, que somos más listos que todo eso, cansados de gastar dinero en innumerables productos, hablamos con los especialistas para sacarnos de dudas.

Esta vez planteamos todas nuestras preguntas a la Dra. Espallargas y le formulamos aquello que nunca preguntaste y quieres saber de una vez por todas.

DUDA 1. ¿EN QUÉ CASOS DE ALOPECIA PUEDE HACER EFECTO UN CHAMPÚ ANTICAÍDA?

"Es un tratamiento efectivo sólo en casos coadyuvantes, no es un tratamiento propiamente dicho. Es decir, el champú es un complemento, pero no puede ser tratamiento único si existe alopecia", dice la Dra Espallargas.

Consejo: si estás perdiendo pelo, antes de elegir el tratamiento por tu cuenta, acude a un dermatólogo o clínica capilar para que evalúen tu caso.

DUDA 2. ¿QUÉ EXPECTATIVAS DEBEMOS TENER CON ELLOS?

Tal y como nos cuenta la experta, como tratamiento de apoyo aporta los tensoactivos adecuados para el cuero cabelludo y la debilidad, o en ocasiones la seborrea, que también es un factor desencadenante de la caída del cuero cabelludo.

Puede ser que creas que tienes alopecia, cuando en realidad, sufres algún tipo de alteración del cuero cabelludo o déficit de vitaminas que son solucionables con otro tipo de tratamientos y no con un champú.

DUDA 3. CUANDO SE TRATA DE ALOPECIA ANDROGENÉTICA, ¿SERÍA MEJOR AHORRARSE EL DINERO Y EMPLEARLO EN OTRO TIPO DE TRATAMIENTOS?

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

"Tanto como ahorrarse el dinero porque comprar un champú contra la alopecia es tirarlo, no me atrevería a afirmar", apunta la doctora y añade "pero sí que en la alopecia androgenética el tratamiento eficaz es a nivel sistémico (ingerido, a través de sustancias que viajan al torrente sanguíneo) y tópico con minoxidil. Además, un tratamiento realmente eficaz sería la carboxiterapia para irrigar el tejido, la alopecia supone que el tejido está enfermo, un paso más sería poner factores de crecimiento epidermico (fce). El champú es un suplemento, pero nunca el tratamiento en sí.

Un champú anticaída jamás es un tratamiento en sí, sólo un complemento

La carboxiterapia es un tratamiento que se realiza en 3 sesiones seguidas, 1 al mes, y después 1 cada 4-6 meses de recordatorio, aunque depende de cada paciente. La sesión dura 20 minutos y cuesta unos 80 €.



DUDA 4. ¿QUÉ INGREDIENTES DEBEMOS BUSCAR EN UN CHAMPÚ ANTICAÍDA?

Aquí nos toca leer la etiqueta, según la especialista, un buen champú anticaída debería contener: silicio, L-cystine, serenoa (plana de la familia de las palmas), zinc, b3, b5, b6, calcio, d-Biotica, calcio.



¿Dudas resueltas? Esperamos que sí. Al menos, conocer la verdad ayuda a elegir mejor (en la vida en general).

CÓMO JUBILARTE A LOS 30

En el departamento How To Extreme Edition, que acaba de crearse en Esquire.es hace escasos minutos, hemos querido plantearnos un reto ambicioso donde los haya: jubilarnos antes de los 40. Si puede ser a los treinta y pocos, mejor.

El problema, después de echar unos cuantos números, es que para nosotros no va a ser posible. Pero hay una esperanza para ti.



Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

Que sí, que sí, que hemos hecho el cálculo y, en el mejor de los casos, de media, si nos quisiéramos jubilar anticipadamente, en la Redacción de Esquire.es tendríamos que esperar 36,7 años para poder jubilarnos por nuestros propios medios. Sí, muy triste, pero es que, claro, vemos las chanclas de Balenciaga (535 euros) y cómo no van a pasar a formar parte de nuestro fondo de armario (es broma, antes nos lo gastamos en estos trajazos).

Como no queremos que a ti te pase lo mismo que a nosotros, nos hemos puesto a investigar cómo puedes plantearte tú esa jubilación anticipada que a nosotros se nos escapa.



La pregunta de oro es: ¿Cuándo podré retirarme? ¿Cómo sé cuánto dinero es suficiente para retirarme? Hay dos variables que debes tener en cuenta: ¿Cuánto dinero ganas? y ¿Con cuánto dinero eres capaz de vivir? Con esto sabes cuánto dinero eres capaz de ahorrar y qué porcentaje supone de tus ingresos.

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

Vamos a ir abriendo boca. Aquí tienes una calculadora que lo hace todo por ti. Sólo tienes que decirle cuánto dinero ganas neto al año, cuánto ahorras y qué gastos aproximados tienes. Y, voilá, te dice cuándo te vas a poder retirar. Estos han sido nuestros cálculos:

Impresionante, ¿verdad? Nos referimos a la calculadora, no a nuestra capacidad de gasto.



¿A Santo de qué nos ponemos a explicarte cómo retirarte a los treinta?

Todo viene a cuenta del movimiento FIRE en Estados Unidos, de sus hilos en Reddit y del blog de Mr. Money Moustache, un ingeniero de software que a los 3o años decidió dejar de trabajar. Porque toda revolución tiene una chispa que la inicia. Y esta revolución ha empezado con un bigote. Mejor dicho: con un señor bigote.

Money and Confidence are Interchangeable https://t.co/B2M7UcfFi4 — Mr. Money Mustache (@mrmoneymustache) March 9, 2018

¿Que qué es el movimiento FIRE? (Mira que no saberlo.) Sus siglas en inglés quizá te aclaren algo: Financial Independence Retire Early. No hace falta ni traducirlo. Nacido al calor del estallido de la burbuja de las puntocom en el cambio de milenio y a la crisis financiera de la primera década del siglo XXI, este movimiento propugna la jubilación anticipada y gana cada vez más adeptos entre los ingenieros de Silicon Valley. Así que en lo que se refiere a la casilla de actualidad, check!

Lo normal es que no te fíes de nosotros, así que se nos ha ocurrido hablar con Esmeralda Gómez, una licenciada en Matemáticas especializada en Astrofísica, que se hizo un máster en Finanzas Cuantitativas, terminó trabajando para un banco estadounidense e, indirectamente, a través de verle las tripas a la banca, aprendió sobre independencia financiera, jubilación anticipada, y a vivir mejor con menos. Esmeralda, además, acaba de publicar Tu llave a la libertad financiera (Planeta, 2018).



Vamos a quitarnos de encima la pregunta que te quita el sueño: ¿Cómo sé cuánto dinero es suficiente para retirarme? "La clave está en el nivel de gasto de cada persona. Es suficiente disponer de un flujo entrante de dinero (en forma de ingresos pasivos) que cubra el flujo saliente de dinero (en forma de gasto). Es también fundamental que el sistema que se construya sea a través de ingresos automáticos, ya que una vez generado una fuente de ingresos más, la persona vuelve a disponer de tiempo para generar otra diferente. Mencionar que la generación de una fuente de ingresos pasivos requiere una inversión de tiempo de entre meses y años", nos explica Gómez.

Vamos con una ecuación sencillita para calcular tu libertad financiera

Esmeralda se ha inventado dos ecuaciones para que puedas analizar tu libertad financiera sin necesidad de ser una lumbrera. La más importante es ésta:

Esmeralda Gómez / Esquire

El resultado de la ecuación te dará un porcentaje que indica hasta qué punto eres libre financieramente hablando. "Si el resultado está próximo al 0%, significa que no tienes libertad financiera, es decir, no tienes apenas ahorros y tampoco tienes una fuente de ingresos pasivos, sino que, lo más probable, es que dependas de un salario. Por el contrario, si el resultado está entre el 0% y el 100%, es que estás camino de alcanzar la libertad financiera. Si tu resultado es próximo o igual al 100%, es que ya la has alcanzado", explica esta matemática.



Otro punto de vista para cuantificar en qué punto del camino te encuentras es a través del número de años que podrías vivir manteniendo tu nivel de vida actual en el caso de que mañana dejaras de trabajar. Esto es, los años de libertad financiera que tienes. “Si tus ingresos pasivos mensuales son superiores a lo que gastas al mes, es porque ya eres libre financieramente, por lo que el resultado te dará negativo. En cualquier otro caso, como decía, obtendrás los años de libertad financiera que tienes si mañana dejaras tu trabajo habitual", añade.



Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

Y ahora viene la pregunta: ¿Qué es lo que puedes hacer? Pues bien, tienes dos vías:



Una: Ni se te ocurra tocar el dinero que tienes ahorrado

“Esto sucede cuando la suma de todo tu líquido en el corto plazo dividido por el importe de gasto medio anual supera en años la esperanza de vida. Por ejemplo, una persona que gaste de media al año 10.000 euros, y según la esperanza de vida le quedan cincuenta años de vida, tendría que tener ahorrados 500.000 euros para haber alcanzado la libertad financiera total, bajo el supuesto de no realizar ninguna actividad laboral. Es un mensaje simplificado de lo que tendría que tener ahorrado, ya que el dinero se devalúa con el paso del tiempo debido a la inflación”, resume.

Dos: Consiguiendo que sean más las gallinas que entran que las que salen

“Esto sucede cuando construyes un sistema que genera ingresos automáticos sin la necesidad de un trabajo presencial y constante, de manera que los ingresos superan los gastos. Se trata de encontrar un equilibrio positivo en el que la entrada de dinero supera los gastos. En el mismo ejemplo anterior, si la persona es capaz de construir un sistema de ingresos pasivos que genere 10.000 euros anuales, también sería completamente libre desde el punto de vista financiero”, señala Gómez.

Las preguntas de oro son: ¿Cuánto dinero ganas? y ¿Con cuánto dinero eres capaz de vivir?

Tres: Evitando comprarte las chanclas de Balenciaga

Por tanto, tienes dos herramientas para avanzar hacia la libertad financiera que puedes combinar, aumentar tus ahorros y conseguir ingresos pasivos. "Si bien, existe una tercera acción que puedes llevar a cabo para acelerar el ascenso a este estado, y es reducir tus gastos mensuales", plantea esta experta en independencia financiera. Al hacerlo, ocurren tres cosas principales:

a) Tienes más dinero que puedes dedicar al ahorro.

b) Tienes más dinero que puedes dedicar a la inversión.

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

c) Es más fácil llegar al nuevo nivel de gasto a través del ahorro y los ingresos pasivos, ya que el umbral de libertad financiera es un importe más bajo al haber reducido tu nivel de gasto.

No tienes más remedio que aprender a ahorrar: Házlo así

“La clave es dominar el arte del ahorro, para invertir y especular con parte de lo ahorrado. Las inversiones producirán los ingresos pasivos y las especulaciones producirán ganancias procedentes de la compra-venta. Cuando tus ingresos pasivos superen o igualen tu gasto mensual, tendrás libertad total. Si los ingresos pasivos superan tu gasto mensual, el exceso que no gastes lo podrás ir invirtiendo para así aumentar tus ingresos pasivos”, apunta Gómez.



Si tus ahorros superan un tercio de tu ingreso anual neto, debes aplicar una estrategia, y si tus ahorros son inferiores a ese tercio de tu ingreso anual neto, la estrategia que debes seguir es otra.



“La estrategia que debes seguir si tienes ahorrado menos de un tercio de tus ingresos anuales netos es destinar el 20% al ahorro, el 10% a la inversión y el 70% al gasto. Es la estrategia 20-10-70. El 70% del gasto se desglosa a su vez en un máximo del 35% del ingreso mensual neto para deudas, de las cuales el 30 % como máximo puede ir destinado al préstamo hipotecario y el 5% restante a los otros préstamos. El 35 % del ingreso mensual neto restante se destina a los gastos habituales: suministros, transporte, alimentación, etcétera”, plantea.

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

“En el caso de que tengas ahorrado más de un tercio de tus ingresos anuales netos, la estrategia que se seguirá es la 5-25-70, que consiste en destinar más cantidad a la inversión, dado que se cuenta con unos ahorros que aportan seguridad financiera: el 5% al ahorro, el 25% a la inversión y el 70% al gasto”, continúa.

“Cuando hayas alcanzado un nivel de ahorro acorde a tu situación financiera, esto es, tener ahorrado un tercio de tu ingreso anual neto, entonces debes redistribuir lo que dedicabas al ahorro y focalizar el dinero en las inversiones: destinar el 25 % a las inversiones, el 5 % al ahorro y el 70 % al gasto. De esta manera, tras conseguir una seguridad y unos hábitos de ahorro, aceleras el rumbo hacia la libertad financiera”, sugiere.

Un consejo: lleva tu contabilidad en una agenda o en una app

"La práctica de apuntar en una agenda todos los ingresos y los gastos tiene un doble sentido. Por un lado, ser consciente del flujo del dinero que se produce a tu alrededor, ya que en muchas ocasiones las personas gastan y no saben en qué lo han hecho y al llegar a fin de mes se sorprenden. Por otro lado, al tener la costumbre de apuntar en la agenda, psicológicamente ocurre algo parecido a la práctica de pagar con dinero, y es que se ahorra dinero. Además de apuntar tus gastos e ingresos, haz revisiones diarias de tu situación económica. Comprueba diariamente los sitios donde tengas depositado tu dinero", señala.

¿Qué apps? Tienes aplicaciones como Fintonic, que te van al pelo.

Lo que te decía tu padre: Paga al contado

Este consejo, por muy viejuno que te suene es una verdad como un templo si quieres ahorrar (déjate de gurús del apalancamiento). "Aumenta tus pagos al contado. Cuando vayas a comprar un producto, el que sea, debes poder pagarlo íntegramente de una vez. Hay dos razones para ello que están interrelacionadas; una es psicológica y la otra es económica. En el caso de que la financiación conlleve un tipo de interés, estarás pagando por el artículo más de lo que pagarías si lo haces al contado", señala Gómez.

Y recuerda: la suma de tus deudas no debe superar el 35% de tus ingresos mensuales

Acabamos con un último buen consejo. "Teniendo en cuenta que la hipoteca no debe superar el 30% de tus ingresos, en el caso de que tengas hipoteca, tienes un pequeño margen de maniobra para endeudamiento. La compra de una casa para vivir en ella debería ser posterior a haber generado distintas fuentes de ingresos pasivos", concluye Gómez.

A nosotros todo esto nos ha parecido práctico. Ahora te toca ponerlo en práctica. Nosotros llegamos tarde.

10 MANERAS DE SER MÁS ATRACTIVO AL INSTANTE

Los arreglos rápidos suelen tener mala fama, y muchas veces para mejorar se necesita tiempo y paciencia. Dicho esto, todavía hay un montón de maneras con las que puedes mejorar sin necesitar un plan de cinco años.

El viejo adagio que dice que tus zapatos son la primera cosa en la que la gente se fija no ha cambiado mucho. Por suerte, las opciones de calzado para elegir son más abundantes que nunca, por lo que realmente no tienes excusa para llevar algo bueno en tus pies.

¿Necesitas algo de inspiración? No hace falta que busques mucho más que en nuestra última recopilación de los últimos lanzamientos.

2 | Abre las piernas (sí, de verdad)

Ampliamente ridiculizado como uno de los crímenes más atroces del siglo XXI, "manspreading" es un término usado para denominar a los hombres que ocupan demasiado espacio en el transporte público. Ciertamente no estamos abogando por agobiar a nadie en el metro abriendo las piernas como si no hubiera final, pero resulta que maximizar el espacio tiene algunos méritos.

Un estudio ha determinado que los hombres tienen más éxito flirteando cuando ocupan más espacio con sus cuerpos (estirándose, extensión de los brazos, abriéndose de piernas) que cuando deciden cerrarse o simplemente apocarse. Eso sí, esto no significa que entres en los sitios desplegando los brazos como si fueras un helicóptero.

3 | Mejora tu aroma

No hace falta ser un genio para saberse esta fórmula: olor corporal = malo. ¿Sabes cuánto te puede ayudar un buen olor? A principios de este año se publicó una investigación que afirmaba que tu voz y tu olor juegan papeles cruciales para que la gente te encuentre atractivo, no tan sólo tu vestuario.

4 | Adapta tu lenguaje

Getty Images

Nuestra voz, las palabras que usamos y la forma en las que las usamos tienen un impacto real en cómo te relacionas con la gente. Hacer preguntas y usar la palabra "tú" más te hace parecer más atractivo para otras personas, y algunos estudios indican que los cerebros de las personas se activan cuando oyen su propio nombre.

Un estudio de Harvard incluso dictaminó que hablar de ti mismo estimula las mismas regiones del cerebro que el sexo o una buena comida. Así que sé el tipo de persona que escucha, en vez del que habla.

La postura es un factor clave en la formación de las percepciones que otras personas se hacen sobre nosotros: entre andar encorvado y estirado hay varias etapas evolutivas. Si tienes problemas de espalda intenta usar una cinta adhesiva deportiva, de la nuca por la columna vertebral y de un omóplato a otro.

Esto corregirá tu postura y te recordará que debes mantener la espalda recta. Una cinta kinesiológica es particularmente eficaz.





6 | Cuida tus cejas

Como regla general, cualquier cosa que se encuentre en tu cara necesita un poco de mantenimiento y atención. Algunos hombres afortunadamente no tienen mucho por lo que preocuparse, pero la gran mayoría tenemos que estar arrancando pelos sueltos y en general impidiendo que las cosas se descontrolen.

Como muy bien apunta nuestra guía para el aseo personal: “Presta mucha atención a la zona central de las cejas, y a cualquier pelo errante que se quiera salir del conjunto. Sabemos que toma mucho tiempo, por lo que te recomendamos que si es necesario le pidas ayuda a tu peluquero. Según un estudio del M.I.T, el reconocimiento facial depende más de las cejas que de los ojos. Un razón más para no ignorar a tus amigas peludas.

El concepto bello durmiente podría sonar como un tema que sólo Disney podría comprar, pero algo de verdad tiene cuando diversas investigaciones han determinado que "las personas privadas de sueño son percibidas como más fatigadas, menos atractivas, más tristes y menos saludables que cuando están descansadas".

No hay excusas, esta no podría ser más fácil.

8 | Invierte en una crema hidratante con protección solar

Incluso si vives en la oscura Inglaterra, donde el agosto es bastante lamentable si hablamos de horas de sol, tienes que proteger tu piel. Los rayos UV atacan, secan y dañan tu piel incluso en climas nublados

Te sugerimos que uses una crema hidratante con un mínimo de protección solar, dependiendo de donde vivas, pero al menos de nivel 15. Y a diario, que será algo que ayudará y nutrirá tu piel a corto plazo y la protegerá del envejecimiento a largo plazo.

9 | Saca a los muchachos

Getty Images

Puede parecer contraproducente moverse en un grupo al intentar destacarse de la multitud, pero hay estudios que dicen que el "efecto animadora" es algo real, lo que significa que el cerebro humano tiende a ver las caras de las personas más atractivas en un grupo que cuando las ve como sujetos individuales.

Esto significa que salir con tus mejores amigos en realidad te beneficia. Así que no te olvides llamarles y a darse una vuelta.

10 | Copia sus movimientos

Getty Images

Reflejar el lenguaje corporal de alguien al interactuar con ellos es una forma de aumentar la confianza. Esta es la conclusión de un estudio, que además afirma que "el mimetismo no sólo aumenta la buena voluntad, sino que en general también provoca una mayor orientación social".

Sin embargo, como los consejos anteriores, este es otro truco psicológico que hay que ejercitar con cuidado. No quieres que nadie piense que estás intentando coreografiar un musical de su vida. O peor, que te estás burlando.

SABEMOS CUÁL VA A SER EL ARGUMENTO DE LA PELÍCULA DE LOS SOPRANO

Las hemerotecas, siempre lo decimos, son fabulosas. Dónde, si no, habríamos encontrado al creador de Los Soprano, David Chase, reconociendo que un "querido amigo" de su madre era "de alguna manera cercano" a la organización mafiosa encabezada por Ruggiero Boiardo, un capo de la familia del crimen genovés con sede en Newark. Boiardo, quien murió en 1984 a la edad de 93 años, seguramente se habría sentido complacido al saber que Chase se inspiró en su vida y milagros para crear el universo de Tony Soprano, su familia y sus secuaces. El matón con frecuencia les decía a sus asociados que creía que él era el modelo para Don Vito Corleone en El Padrino (que sabemos por el propio Mario Puzzo que era al revés: que no se fijó en mafiosos para crear su ficción, sino que los mafiosos se empezaron a comportar tal y como se comportaban sus personajes de ficción). Lo que sí está claro es que Ruggiero Boiardo es el modelo para el guión que acaba de entregar a New Line Cinema David Chase, The many saints of Newark (Los santos de Newark), la película precuela de Los Soprano.

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

Hasta ahora lo único que ha trascendido de forma oficial de la película es que el guión ya está sobre la mesa, cuál es su título, que está firmado por David Chase y Lawrence Conner, y que se centra en los disturbios que se produjeron en los años sesenta entre la comunidad afroamericana y la italiana en Newark, Nueva Jersey, la ciudad donde se desarrolló el pequeño imperio criminal de la familia Soprano en la serie de HBO. Y nosotros añadimos: Y sus consecuencias.

Proque volviendo a la hemeroteca nos hemos preguntado qué pasó exactamente. Y lo que pasó es que la familia de Boiardo creció al calor de esos disturbios y de una red de políticos corruptos. O sea que nació como el resultado de esos disturbios, que sumieron a la ciudad en una crisis.

Resulta que hasta la década de 1960, las ciudades de Jersey, aunque pequeñas, habían sido autosuficientes, desempeñando un papel menor en la economía regional, marcada por Nueva York. Newark, por ejemplo, se convirtió en una ciudad portuaria muy activa, con un pequeño foco industrial que llegó a emplear a 66.000 trabajadores de los 450.000 habitantes de la ciudad. Pero cuando estallaron disturbios raciales entre las comunidades afroamericana e italiana en Newark, Camden y otras ciudades de Jersey a finales de la década de 1960, muchos residentes y negocios huyeron de los suburbios que los neoyorquinos habían estado inundando durante décadas. Ciudades como Newark terminaron con una vida económica triste y en su mayoría con poblaciones indigentes. El caldo de cultivo perfecto para la mafia.

Después de los disturbios de Newark, los fiscales federales atacaron al entonces alcalde Hugh Addonizio, quien había dado el control de gran parte de la ciudad a los jefes de la mafia Ruggiero Boiardo (cuya familia criminal inspiró a Los Soprano ) y Ray DeCarlo. Después de que los federales condenaran a Addonizio y a varios de sus subordinados por corrupción, los "reformistas" que se hicieron cargo luego del consistorio fueron todo menos eso: trajeron más de lo mismo. El nuevo alcalde Kenneth Gibson, que se comprometió a poner fin a la sordidez y revivir a Newark, se enfrentó a incesantes investigaciones sobre su administración durante los años siguientes. Hasta que dimitió (porque probar lo que se dice probar no pudieron probar nada en su contra).

Publicidad - Sigue leyendo debajo

Las investigaciones de corrupción en la Administración del siguiente alcalde, Sharpe James, durante casi 20 años derribaron a concejales de la ciudad, al propio jefe de personal del alcalde y al comisionado de policía, que se declararon culpables en 1996 de saquear un fondo que financió investigaciones encubiertas de narcóticos. Camden tampoco fue menos sombrío: tres de sus alcaldes fueron condenados por corrupción y depuestos.

Y entonces llegamos a Los Soprano. Y esto, señoras y señores, es lo que creemos que va a contar la película. Sólo que con el apellido Soprano. En The Many Saints of Newark podremos ver versiones jóvenes de muchos de los personajes de la serie de HBO, incluidos a Tony Soprano (el fallecido James Gandolfini), a su padre (obviamente), a Giovanni "Johnny Boy" Soprano (Joseph Siravo) y Livia (Nancy Marchand), así como a su tío Junior (Dominic Chianese).

De momento sólo se ha confirmado a un personaje: Dickey Moltisanti, tío de Tony Soprano y padre de Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli). En el programa, el personaje nunca llega a aparecer, ya que fue asesinado antes del comienzo de los acontecimientos de la serie (lo que veremos en la película), pero sí se menciona que él, junto con el padre de Tony Soprano y el bueno del tío Junior, ayudó a forjar la familia criminal de los Soprano.

Seguiremos especulando, digo informando.

THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIME HAS ONLY GOTTEN BETTER WITH AGE

There are seldom few things in life that actually feel sacred. Your childhood home, the first falling snow of the season, the sound of the ocean at night–these experiences all share a deep, spiritual resonance. Art can evoke those same feelings, making you feel weightless, like gliding over hallowed ground. And while video games are just now starting to explore the depths of their potential as an artistic medium, 1998's The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time somehow transcended that threshold when it came out 20 years ago today.





Released on the now-primitive Nintendo 64, the game feels just as mysterious, tormented, joyous, and spirited as it did when it first debuted. While modern consoles can compute at hundreds of times the speed and complexity of what that chunky cartridge system could muster, in the two decades that have passed since Ocarina, very few titles have come close to the masterfully-woven craftsmanship, storytelling, and gameplay of what is perhaps gaming’s greatest work of art. Ever since the Boy Without A Fairy first set foot in the gaping mouth of the Great Deku Tree, players have been enraptured by this adventure, a lyrical piece of soul-searching that somehow feels equal parts Walt Whitman and Labyrinth.

But what is it about Ocarina that still intoxicates players after all these years? Is it the gameplay, with its then-groundbreaking Z-targeting system, honing players into vicious, focused battles in an open world that feels as expansive as it is detailed? Or perhaps the unforgettable Koji Kondo score, an uplifting, and, at times, impossibly somber, soundtrack that still stands to this day as a benchmark for gaming music?



Many folks would point to the design breakthroughs made in Ocarina, one of the first titles to push the console to its graphical limits, realizing the full potential of what could be created on that 64-bit canvas. The writing, too, brought video games into the modern day, with a cast of idiosyncratic townspeople and central characters who felt, perhaps for the first time in the history of the medium, like living, breathing, sentient creatures with feelings and thoughts and plans all their own.

To me, the secret to Ocarina’s magic is time itself. The reason it has persisted throughout the decades, played and replayed again and again, is because it singularly captures the inevitability of time. The time-travel mechanic in Ocarina, though informed by titles of Zelda past, was the defining moment for the N64 game, adding a layer of perspective to the experience that electrifies the imagination and gives voice to the unspeakable cruelty–and beauty–of nature’s always-ticking clock.

Fans of the game will remember their first experience removing the Master Sword from its consecrated altar, and traveling through time into early adulthood. For many of us, the game felt very relatable from the onset, because we first played it as kids, like the young Link of the game’s first act–an adolescent with big hopes, dreams, and questions about what lie ahead. And if you were raised in the 90s, and became an adult in the 2010s, you may connect deeply with the adult Link of the game’s later sequences, since the world of his adulthood is far weirder and more broken than what we ever expected.





In Ocarina, Link is sealed away in a sort of hibernation for seven years by a group of Sages who hope that when he awakens, he can wield the mighty Master Sword and strike down the dark lord Ganondorf, who has taken over Hyrule in his lust for the all-powerful Triforce. The experience of waking up seven years later, all of a sudden transitioning from a little boy to a young man in the blink of an eye–it feels all too familiar.

When Link ventures out into the adult world for the first time, the beauty of his youth is replaced by a harrowing expanse of loss and ruin. The plants have grown rampant, the skies have grown dark, and the Castle Town’s once-bustling Market is replaced by a screeching, desolate sprawl of monsters known as ReDeads, which likely inspired nightmares for years to come. Link soon finds that the reality of adulthood is an ugly one, and while many of the natural wonders of his world, like the ebullient waters of Lake Hylia, or the exhilarating cliffs of the Gerudo Desert, are still intact, many of his former compatriots have become corrupted, restless, or lost entirely.

It’s in this way that Ocarina of Time transfixes players, exploiting the tragically-slighted hopes of our youth, and the devastating isolation of our newfound adulthood responsibilities, to make for an experience that beautifully bridges the gap between both the young and old forms of our ever-growing selves. For those of us, and I’m sure there are many, that sometimes feel like adulthood is like waking up in the middle of a very long sleep from deep in our childhood, there is simply no game that touches our hearts quite like Ocarina. And just as there is only one Hero of Time–though the same story can be told and retold for generations to come–there will only ever be one Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

MASSACHUSETTS JUST OPENED THE FIRST LEGAL WEED SHOPS ON THE EAST COAST

It has been a banner year for cannabis. In the midterms, Michigan voted to legalize recreational marijuana while Utah and Missouri approved initiatives on medicinal use. Canada legalized the stuff throughout the Great White North, and innovations in cannabis products like weed beer are following quickly behind. And today, Massachusetts opened its very first legal weed shops, welcoming recreational use to the East Coast for the first time ever. That wind off the Atlantic feels good, doesn't it?





NBC News reports that two legal cannabis shops are now open in Massachusetts, two years after the state voted to legalize it in 2016. (It takes time to set up regulations for retail stores.) Both sites are medical marijuana facilities; Massachusetts legalized that back in 2012. By 8 a.m. folks were already lining up, thousands of them according to reports. At the New England Treatment Access in Northhampton, the first in line to buy his cannabis was their mayor David Narkewicz, an Air Force veteran who made a "symbolic" purchase of a THC chocolate bar.

"My plan actually will be to preserve it and display it, because it will be a historic purchase here in the city," he said at a press conference the day before. Send it to the damn Smithsonian.

At Cultivate Holdings in Leicester, Army veteran Stephen Mandile, who served in Iraq and advocates for medical marijuana, made the first purchase. He said cannabis has helped him handle PTSD and anxiety.

"I probably dreamed about it back in high school that this day would happen sometime, but to be actually able to do it today is amazing," he told NBC Boston. "To have veterans be recognized, not just myself, but to bring other veterans with me and to have it focused around that, it's super special to me."



In Massachusetts, you have to be 21 or older to purchase pot, and only one ounce of marijuana or five grams of a concentrate can be bought at a licensed store.

Out here on the East Coast, recreational weed has also been legalized in Maine and Vermont, but dispensaries there are not yet allowed to open to the public. Washington, D.C., has legal weed laws in the books too, but the framework for getting it is convoluted and does not actually allow for the actual purchase yet. Slowly (very slowly) but surely, we're getting there.

THE 10 BEST PLACES TO DINE IN BEIJING

POKÉMON: LET'S GO! TAKES YOU BACK TO '90S NINTENDO BLISS

For many of us former kids who grew up mostly indoors in the 1990s, hearing the familiar chirps, buzzes, and pika pikas! of a first-generation Pokémon game can really rattle up some memories. Like that family vacation to Niagara Falls when I missed the entirety of Earth’s greatest natural wonder because I was too busy trying to evolve my Wartortle. Or that summer when my older brother stole my copy of Pokémon Blue, took it to band camp, and returned with all my Pokémon leveled up to 100 and creatively renamed after genitals (Blastoise was simply “Penis”).



A therapist once told me that, as we get older, every version of ourselves continues to live inside us. That’s why when I saw the announcement for Nintendo's new Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Let’s Go, Evee! games, the '90s-era Game Boy kid whose discount BMX bike still collects Fritos dust in the recesses of my subconscious leapt with joy.



Boasting a return to the beloved story of Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow on the Nintendo Switch's beautiful 3D graphics, Let’s Go tries to usher the franchise into the modern console context while paying tribute to the handheld titles that defined many of our earliest friendships (and rivalries).

The '90s-era Game Boy kid whose discount BMX bike still collects Fritos dust in the recesses of my subconscious leapt with joy.

Let’s Go retells that tale of a newcomer trainer—you can pick your gender and customize your appearance this time—leaving his/her mom’s house to embark on a journey collecting and training the original 151 Pokémon. You face down gym leaders, rivals, Team Rocket, and other familiar faces from the Kanto region, with surprise cameos and new Pokémon cropping up along the way. The game plays very similarly to those chunky late-'90s cartridges but incorporates quirky new features, like Pokémon Go connectivity, animated 3D models of the monsters, and a buzzy little peripheral shaped like a Poké Ball that you can use to control the game and take with you on the run. If you always wanted to feel like you were living inside the world of Pokémon, this is as close as you'll get—at least until Nintendo's theme park is finished in 2020.

Game Freak Inc



Pokémon creator Game Freak captured the exhilaration of our childhoods at a cost, though. That singular escapist feeling of tucking yourself away in the bathroom at a boring family reunion to surf up and down the coast of Cinnabar Island is back full force, but many of the advanced gameplay complexities and improvements to the franchise’s ever-changing formula are gone out the window. Let’s Go rids itself of a nuanced, mature gaming experience in favor of a casual adventure that’s perfect for newcomers, kids, and, perhaps, old connoisseurs of the series returning to video games for the first time. Many “serious” gamers and franchise die-hards will be frustrated by Let’s Go. But I’ve never come across a more perfect title for a morning train ride or quiet hour before bed. Let’s Go is the series back in its most basic form, for better or for worse.





That tug-of-war feeling points towards larger issues for post-Switch Nintendo. The Switch defiantly revitalized the House of N's reputation, saving it from cultural irrelevancy. With every new release, franchise by franchise, game by game, we're seeing Nintendo’s conflicting attempts to either capitalize on its new, casual audience, or feed the gaming beast, which gobbles up more hardcore titles like Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey.

Let’s Go is no Breath of the Wild. It’s also not as hollow as, say, Mario Tennis. The game seeks to be as casual as Pokémon Go, while also asserting itself as a fully formed console title. Does it need to be on the Nintendo Switch? Probably not. Would it be better suited as a $12.99 iPhone app? Maybe. Will mega-fans be angry about this? Definitely.

The expectations for Pokémon: Let’s Go, as with every major franchise outing on the Nintendo Switch, are as heavy as a sleeping Snorlax in the middle of the road. For me, that sugary nostalgia was satisfying enough. But I predict that when the game debuts November 16, it won’t be met by all gamers with such a cheery perspective.

I PIÙ BEI MAGLIONI IN OFFERTA SU AMAZON PER IL BLACK FRIDAY

Ci siamo, il Black Friday è arrivato e Amazon si fa trovare in prima fila, con una vetrina ricca di offerte di ogni tipo. Per quanto riguarda la moda uomo, la scelta non è meno attraente rispetto a quella degli accessori tech, o dei rasoi pensati per la barba e il corpo. Nella miriade di offerte, un acquisto utile può essere quello dei maglioni dell'autunno inverno 2018 2019, visto che non se ne hanno mai abbastanza.

Amazon Moda ha preparato delle offerte speciali, con sconti fino al 25% su Pepe Jeans o al 20% su capi Sisley e United Colors of Benetton. In vista dell'inverno 2019, e soprattutto del Natale 2018, ecco i più bei maglioni da conquistarsi prima possibile.

Maglione grigio inverno 2019 Harmont & Blaine

Harmont & Blaine Courtesy Amazon

Un pullover minimal grigio con scollo rotondo e maniche regolari, perfetto per qualunque outfit autunnale e invernale, da abbinare a pantaloni di lana e stivaletti di pelle, magari con una camicia per costruire un look preppy. Il maglione di Harmont & Blaine è in misto cotone, lana e cashmere.

Maglione di lana Gant con cerniera

Un altro brand di alta qualità, Gant, è presente su Amazon con uno sconto imperdibile in occasione del Black Friday 2018, con un maglione in 100% lana perfetto per un look smart casual. La cerniera permette di creare un look a strati con la camicia, mentre il colore azzurro darà un tocco di colore ai look solitamente scuri e severi dell'inverno.

Maglione bicolor di cotone Armani Exchange

Nelle offerte del Black Friday c'è anche Armani, con la linea Exchange e un maglione bicolore in cotone. Bordeaux e blu per un outfit non banale, perfetto per l'ufficio e per le feste invernali, come il Natale o il Capodanno. Da abbinare a pantaloni scuri e un cappotto a quadri.

Maglione a collo alto Pepe Jeans, la tendenza dell'inverno 2018 2019

Pepe Jeans Courtesy Amazon

La tendenza dei maglioni dell'inverno 2019 parla chiaro: sono a collo alto, morbidi e confortevoli, da abbinare idealmente a blazer di lana e pantaloni sartoriali. Pepe Jeans segue il trend con un pullover dolcevita in misto cotone, lana e cashmere. Il grigio chiaro lo rende ideale anche per i look da giorno, senza giacca, con pantaloni chino e stringate di pelle.

United Colors of Benetton e il maglione in lana con i bottoni

United Colors of Benetton Courtesy Amazon

Un grande classico dei pullover e della maglieria è United Colors of Benetton, presente con le sue offerte su Amazon in occasione del Black Friday e oltre (gli sconti sono fino al 26 novembre 2018). Abbiamo scelto questo maglione in lana per i suoi dettagli, diversi da quelli della maggior parte dei pullover: due bottoni sul colletto da portare anche aperti nel caso si voglia creare un look a strati.

Maglione nero Sisley per i look casual

Sisley propone una selezione di maglioni di lana o altri tessuti, ma quello che ha catturato la nostra attenzione tra le offerte da Black Friday è questo: un pullover nero con scollo rotondo e due bande rosse in vita. Abbastanza per rendere più interessante un look casual sfuggendo alla tipica monocromia dell'inverno. D'altra parte le tendenze moda dell'autunno inverno 2018 2019 parlano chiaro: è quasi ovunque un trionfo di colori.

Il maglione tricolore di Antony Morato

Non il solito tricolore, ma sicuramente più adatto all'inverno 2019 quello di Antony Morato. In misto lana blu navy sul petto, nera sulle maniche e grigia in vita, è un altro ottimo modo per evitare i soliti pullover troppo scuri o troppo sgargianti, come se ne vedono soprattutto intorno a Natale. Il pullover di Morato è autosufficiente, cioè sta bene anche da solo, abbinato soltanto a un paio di jeans neri o pantaloni sartoriali.

Maglione con scollo a V di Tommy Hilfiger

Tommy Hilfiger Courtesy Amazon

Molti uomini apprezzano soltanto i maglioni con lo scollo a V, per lo stesso motivo per cui non abbottonano mai la camicia sul colletto, se non sono costretti: si sentono troppo compressi. Tommy Hilfiger crea un pullover leggero, perfetto per i look a strati, in misto cotone e cashmere grigio chiaro. Perfetto da abbinare a una giacca di lana o un completo in mohair, il più ricercato nell'inverno 2019.

Maglione di lana intrecciata Find, il Black Friday 2018 di Amazon Moda

Find Courtesy Amazon

Find è un brand di Amazon Moda, che si lancia nelle offerte del Black Friday con una selezione di capi dal gusto spesso minimal. In questo caso, però, abbiamo scelto un maglione a tema spiccatamente invernale, da indossare durante le feste natalizie o anche dopo. I ricami intrecciati a contrasto sul tessuto bordeaux lo renderanno protagonista dell'outfit, da completare discretamente con pantaloni neri e scarpe di pelle marrone.

Yakuza 6 (PS4)

Il sesto capitolo della saga di Kiryu Kazuma è arrivato in giappone nel 2016 ma ha dovuto aspettare ben due anni per approdare in Europa e America. Ambientato nel Giappone contemporaneo, Yakuza 6 conclude la vicenda criminale e familiare del gangster giapponese più amato dai giocatori di mezzo mondo offrendoci, finalmente, un nuovo motore grafico, un sistema di combattimento molto meno legnoso dei capitoli precedenti e, soprattutto, una risposta alle tante domande e ai tanti misteri che hanno circondato le avventure di Kiryu e della sua figlioccia Haruka.

God of War (PS4)

Si può prendere una serie nota per la violenza estrema, la totale mancanza di una trama anche appena abbozzata, un gameplay frenetico, un protagonista desideroso solo di distruggere tutto e ribaltarla con una produzione introspettiva, a tratti struggente, girata in piano sequenza? Se siete Cory Barlog la risposta è sì. La quarta avventura del dio della guerra Kratos è una rivoluzione per la serie e uno dei migliori action di questa generazione. Il protagonista e suo figlio dovranno attraversare i sette regni della mitologia nordica e sconfiggere addirittura il sovrano degli dei Odino, il tutto con una grafica da urlo e ambientazioni fra le più belle di sempre. Ah, c’è sempre tanta violenza, ma questa volta con un senso.

Kingdom Come Deliverance

Nato come progetto semiamatoriale su Kickstarter, il gioco è un “simulatore di medioevo” tanto realistico quanto affascinante. Ambientato in Boemia subito dopo la morte di Carlo V d’Asburgo, Kingdom Come ci mette nei panni di un semplice fattore, starà a noi lavorare, crescere e impegnarci per migliorare la nostra condizione sociale. Realistico forse quasi all’eccesso (i combattimenti sono molto difficili, per non parlare del tiro con l’arco o della preparazione di unguenti), il titolo è molto ambizioso e, per questo, all’uscita era azzoppato da una serie di bug e problemi tecnici che, tuttavia, sono stati ampiamente risolti con le ultime patch. L’europa medievale ricreata dagli sviluppatori è un luogo splendido, forse non troppo ospitale, ma capace di appassionare qualsiasi videogiocatore per ore e ore. Almeno finché il nostro protagonista non morirà per una infezione mal curata.

Monster Hunter: World

Ciclopico come tutti i Monster Hunter e terribilmente giapponese come tutti i Monster Hunter, World è il primo, vero, tentativo di Capcom di rendere la caccia ai mostri digeribile anche per i giocatori occidentali. Quattordicesimo titolo di una serie (quinto, se si considera solo la numerazione ufficiale) amatissima in Giappone e di culto fuori dal Sol Levante, Monster Hunter ci mette nei panni di un cacciatore impegnato nella cattura e nell’uccisione di enormi mostri. Alcuni somigliano a tirannosauri con le ali, altri sono puma grandi come elefanti, altri ancora istrici che sputano acido, e via discorrendo.

Ogni creatura ha le sue debolezze e può essere sconfitta solo con l’equipaggiamento corretto e con molta, molta, molta pazienza. Ma non disperate! Ogni caccia può essere affrontata anche online insieme ad altre cinque persone al massimo. Difficile, appassionante e profondissimo, Monster Hunter: World può essere il compagno giusto delle lunghe e fredde serate invernali, quando due ore davanti al televisore nel tentativo di catturare quel maledetto Odogaron diventano più attraenti di qualsiasi uscita in società.

Far Cry 5

L’america moderna, il midwest, una sette estremista cristiana, un leader convinto di essere il nuovo messia, tanti redneck arrabbiati e armati fino ai denti. Un film neorealista? No, si tratta delle premesse dell’ultimo capitolo della fortunatissima serie Ubisoft che, abbandonato il Nepal e le isole caraibiche, si sposta in una non meglio definita “terra di nessuno” al centro degli Stati Uniti d’America. Qui dovremo investigare su uno strano culto che sta prendendo sempre più piede e, al tempo stesso, evitare lo scoppio di una guerra civile. Per farlo dovremo addomesticare animali, volare in parapendio, sparare tantissimo e devastare un bel pezzo della provincia profonda americana. Cosa chiedere di meglio?

Octopath Traveller (Switch)

Gli anni ‘90 non torneranno più, lo sappiamo, e nemmeno la nostra giovinezza. Octopath Traveller però ci va vicinissimo: sviluppato da Square Enix mescolando la tradizione dei primi Final Fantasy con le tecnologie moderne, il titolo è un omaggio ai giochi di ruolo che hanno fatto la storia del gaming. Gli otto protagonisti dovranno esplorare un mondo fantasy gravato, guarda un po’, da una tremenda minaccia, il tutto con una splendida grafica bidimensionale che unisce la pixel art alle alte risoluzioni. Octopath Traveller è un tuffo in un passato più ingenuo, forse più semplice ma capace di risvegliare emozioni antiche. Peraltro, grazie alle doti portatili di Nintendo Switch, è il titolo migliore per eventuali lunghi viaggi necessari al rientro a casa in occasione delle vacanze.

Mario Tennis Aces (Switch)

Nintendo quando si parla di giocare in compagnia sa il fatto suo. Dopo Mario Kart, il famoso idraulico si cimenta anche con terra battuta e racchette, grazie a un gioco che unisce l’immediatezza degli arcade classici con la follia dei titoli di Super Mario. Divertente in singolo, straordinario in due (o più) giocatori, Mario Tennis Aces è il gioco perfetto per il post-pranzo di Natale, quando, gonfi e sonnolenti, ci si trascina verso il divano sperando di evitare il solito - tremendo - special di Domenica In.

Sea of Thieves (Xbox)

Ultimo parto di quella Rare che vent’anni fa ci regalava perle come Banjo Kazooie o Goldeneye 007, Sea of Thieves ci mette nei panni di temibili pirati caraibici in un vasto mare popolato da altri tremendi corsari. Pensato solo per l’online, il gioco unisce il tratto leggero delle produzioni Rare al culto per il loot (il bottino) tipico del multigiocatore moderno. Non perfetto e forse un po’ troppo scarno ai tempi dell’uscita, oggi Sea of Thieves riesce ad offrire un’esperienza abbastanza godibile e, soprattutto, destinata a crescere nei prossimi mesi. Vero, siamo quasi a Natale ma, francamente, a chi non piace travestirsi da pirata anche fuori stagione?

Soul Calibur 6

I picchiaduro sono un genere che non va più troppo di moda: tecnici, difficili da padroneggiare, a volte ripetitivi, da sovrani incontrastati delle console e delle sale giochi sono diventati titoli di nicchia, per veri amatori. Soul Calibur 6 arriva sulle nostre console con un rooster che recupera un bel pezzo dei personaggi più amati dei precedenti capitoli con, in aggiunta, alcuni protagonisti extra, come Geralt di The Witcher. Le nuove modalità di gioco, come il sistema di parate rivisto e la possibilità di rallentare il tempo offrono spunti interessanti anche per i veterani, mentre sotto la scocca, rimane sempre l’elegantissimo e pressochè perfetto sistema di combattimento che avevamo imparato ad amare.

LE MIGLIORI OFFERTE TECH PER IL BLACK FRIDAY

Quel momento dell’anno è arrivato, è il Black Friday. Il “venerdì nero” non è un inizio di un weekend con le borse in calo (poi certo, anche questo oggi è abbastanza probabile) ma il venerdì in cui negozi fisici e online mettono in vendita i loro prodotti a prezzi scontati. La tradizione è anglosassone e se si googla “Black Friday” vengono fuori soprattutto tristissimi video in cui la gente si azzuffa per entrare nei grandi magazzini la mattina presto, o peggio si rende ridicola discutendo animatamente per aggiudicarsi l’ultima TV scontata in vendita.

Pubblicità - Continua a leggere di seguito

Ma il venerdì nero è soprattutto altro: un ottimo momento per spendere meno e comprare ciò che ci serve, come i regali di Natale, per esempio. Un modo per approfittare di prezzi bassi, per riuscire ad avere, con la stessa spesa che avevamo preventivato di fare, prodotti di maggiore qualità. Insomma, un modo per essere attenti e fare una scelta razionale: comprare ciò che serve, ma a condizioni migliori.

Nessuna tenda da campeggio fuori dai grandi magazzini, quindi. Solamente un computer con cui accedere ad Amazon e una lista di cose utili, di ottima qualità e che magari potremmo regalare tra un mese - evitando così lungaggini, code e spese eccessive fatte all’ultimo minuto.

Quindi ecco qui una lista, tutta di articoli tecnologici, tutti scontati e da prendere su Amazon, il sito più fornito e frequentato durante il Black Friday.





1) Lettore ebook: il nuovo Kindle

Il Kindle è forse, ad oggi, il più fortunato dei prodotti firmati Amazon. Il lettore ha ottime recensioni e in questa nuova versione è resistente all’acqua e ha addirittura il doppio della memoria della versione precedente. Leggere su Kindle non fa male alla vista, perché lo schermo non è retroilluminato come negli smartphone o nei computer. Oltre che innocuo per i nostri occhi (lo schermo funziona con dei pixel binari bianco/nero proprio come la stampa su carta) è anche un modo ottimo di salvaguardare l’ambiente. Zero carta stampata per infiniti libri da leggere.

L’isolamento dall’esterno è una delle caratteristiche migliori di queste prodotte da Cowin. E sono anche belle.

9) Fotocamera da caccia/birdwatching Victure HC200

Viene venduta come fotocamera “da caccia”, e probabilmente è così che è stata progettata, per le esigenze di chi effettivamente va in giro per i boschi munito di fucile. Ma è tranquillamente utilizzabile come camera per il birdwatching o per chi vuole osservare la natura con accuratezza e lentezza. La si posiziona su rami o tronchi con delle stringhe, e grazie al fatto che la struttura è impermeabile e il colore è mimetico si riescono a fare foto molto belle alla fauna. La camera è anche notturna, cosa che amplia di molto le possibilità di utilizzo.

CHI SONO E COSA FANNO DAVVERO I VOLONTARI COME SILVIA ROMANO

Tre anni fa, dopo aver lavorato a lungo in altri àmbiti, sono tornato a casa. Sono tornato a fare quello che avevo fatto, per qualche tempo, all’età di Silvia Romano: in Palestina, in Burkina Faso, ma anche in Italia, con senzatetto, vittime del terremoto e immigrati. Sono tornato, certo, perché volevo sentirmi utile, perché pensavo che c’era molto da fare, e perché pensavo di poter essere efficace. Ma sono tornato anche perché fare quello che faccio ora mi permette di lavorare assieme a persone come Silvia.

Sono partito per la Grecia, per lavorare nei campi profughi che ospitavano (e ospitano ancora, anche se tutti se ne sono dimenticati) i profughi che scappano dalla guerra in Siria, dall’Iraq, dall’Afghanistan. E, assieme ad altri volontarî che lavoravano lì, abbiamo creato una ONG che cerca di dare una mano a costruire un futuro migliore per queste persone: Second Tree.

E quindi sono tre anni che il mio lavoro è valutare, poi conoscere, poi lavorare assieme a persone come Silvia. Penso valga la pena raccontare – chi sono, cosa fanno, e da cosa sono motivate – queste persone, al di là delle cattiverie e delle meschinità che si leggono in questi giorni. E penso valga la pena perché vivere una vita che è popolata da persone come Silvia è un privilegio, e raccontandole mi sembra di condividere un po’ questo privilegio con chi legge.

Ovviamente non conosco Silvia (la chiamo ugualmente per nome, perché è come ci chiamiamo tutti, qui), e non conosco i dettagli del suo quotidiano, quali siano le sue aspirazioni e quale la sua vita; ma tutte le persone che ho conosciuto hanno qualosa in comune, ed è di queste cose in comune che voglio parlare. Vi stupirete: non è che siano tutte buone, o altruiste. Ovviamente lo sono, ma c’è dell’altro.

La prima cosa da capire è che partire come volontario è difficile. Chiunque abbia provato a fare un esperienza di volontariato all’estero sa che le selezioni sono dure, molto dure. Non puoi prendere uno zaino e partire. Perché noi non abbiamo bisogno (soltanto) di persone buone, ma di persone capaci, professionali, che possano avere un vero impatto sui profughi. Nel caso di Second Tree, abbiamo prima un colloquio di un paio d’ore con me (che coordino l’organizzazione) e poi uno di un’oretta con il coordinatore del programma per il quale il candidato sta facendo domanda. In media, di persone ne prendiamo una ogni venti.

E tutto questo per venire a dare una mano senza essere pagati? Sì, esatto. Per questo. Noi offriamo un posto dove dormire e il trasporto da casa ai diversi campi, altre organizzazioni non sono nelle condizioni di offrire neanche quello. Eppure i volontari sono fra le persone più professionali, appassionate e generose che conosco. Certo, ci sono tante altre persone che ci danno una mano, da casa: magari con la raccolta fondi o la comunicazione. Ma quelli che vengono qui, vengono qui perché sono assolutamente necessari. Per la semplice ragione che lavorare in un campo profughi è un lavoro delicato, e ogni volontario è un costo per l’organizzazione, e i soldi sono sempre molti pochi. Quindi, ecco, se sapete che un volontario è partito per lavorare in qualche area svantaggiata, dovreste partire con un pregiudizio. Positivo. Altro che fricchettoni naïf, sono persone responsabili e con dei talenti da condividere, oltre che, ovviamente, il proverbiale “cuore grande”.

Ma quindi che cos’è che li motiva? È una delle prime domande che faccio, nel colloquio. Le risposte sono perfino banali, nella loro onestà. Sono andato a rivedere quello che avevo scritto, una decina d’anni fa, per rispondere a questa stessa domanda. E ci leggo tante delle risposte che ascolto: la piena consapevolezza che il mondo non si cambia con un cucchiaino, ma che con qualcosa – perfino un cucchiaino – si deve pur cominciare. La totale assenza di un furore missionario, soltanto una buona dose di ottimismo della volontà.

Un ottimismo che contagia. Io, che ho una decina d’anni più di loro, posso dire che se ho fiducia che le cose miglioreranno è in gran parte perché vedo questi ragazzi sotto i trent’anni che decidono che prendersi cura del prossimo è importante. Sono l’espressione di una generazione vilipesa, che parla meno di quanto fa. Che viene da tanti Paesi, d’Europa e del mondo. Che non odia sé stessa per essere nata in un luogo più fortunato, ma ne è consapevole. E per questo si dà da fare.

Come racconta Bruno Manghi in un bel libriccino (Fare del bene, Marsilio) uscito quando io avevo esattamente l’età di Silvia, e avevo appena fatto quella scelta, il volontariato è un fenomeno che è sempre esistito, ma che soltanto negli ultimi trent’anni ha assunto un vero valore sociale e in qualche modo postideologico. Non c’è bisogno di grandi schemi o chiavi di lettura per capire Silvia e i tanti ragazzi come lei. Il beneficio del loro lavoro non è soltanto nel bene che fanno, ma anche nell’ispirare altre persone a farlo. Come scrive Manghi, questa generazione di volontari “osa disobbedire all'incombere del male e rivela altre possibilità di esistenza”.

Sono queste altre possibilità di esistenza, rivelate dalle persone come Silvia, che turbano chi si fa poche domande. Perché sono il nostro specchio. E guardarsi allo specchio è spesso spiacevole. Cos’è quell’immagine che vedo riflessa? Come si accompagna all’idea che ho di me? È per questo che dico che le tante sciocchezze meschine che abbiamo sentito su Silvia, e in fondo sui tanti volontari coi quali lavoro ogni giorno, qualificano più chi le dice che non chi dovrebbe riceverle, e perciò non vale la pena replicare.

Ci sono tante altre persone, la maggioranza io credo, che magari non fanno la scelta di Silvia, ma ne riconoscono il valore. Sono queste le voci che vorrei sentire. Non c’è bisogno di dare la vita per gli altri per apprezzare chi prova a farlo. Forse è vero che partire come volontario per l’Africa non è una cosa alla portata di tutti. Evitare di insultare chi lo fa, invece, lo è.

L’ANNO PEGGIORE DI TUTTI I TEMPI

Crisi economica, riscaldamento globale, terrorismo, ritorno dei nazionalismi, tensioni internazionali tra le superpotenze, disuguaglianze crescenti e chi più ne ha più ne metta. Gli ultimi anni non sono sicuramente stati i migliori che l’umanità abbia mai affrontato. Eppure, se provassimo ad allargare un po’ lo sguardo, ci renderemmo conto di come ci sia davvero poco da lamentarsi. D’altra parte, il detto “si stava meglio quando si stava peggio” indica soprattutto una cosa: oggi, tutto sommato, non ce la passiamo per niente male.

Pubblicità - Continua a leggere di seguito

Ma se le cose stanno così, è possibile capire quale sia stato il periodo più difficile che l’umanità abbia mai affrontato? Insomma, quale sia stato l’anno peggiore di tutti i tempi? Ci ha provato un team di scienziati e storici, trovando una risposta molto diversa da quella che vi potreste aspettare. L’anno peggiore di sempre non è infatti né il 1918, quando l’influenza spagnola provocò la morte di 50-100 milioni di persone; né il 1349, quando la pesta nera cancellò metà della popolazione europea. No, l’anno più buio di sempre sarebbe il 536 d.C.

Una nebbia misteriosa avvolse tutta l’Europa, il Medio Oriente e parte dell’Asia; oscurando il sole

“È stato l’inizio di uno dei peggiori periodi in cui essere vivi, se non l’anno peggiore in assoluto”, ha raccontato a Science il docente di Harvard Michael McCormick. Nel corso di quei 12 mesi, infatti, una nebbia misteriosa avvolse tutta l’Europa, il Medio Oriente e parte dell’Asia; oscurando il sole e privando questa vasta zona di luce per oltre 18 mesi. “Il Sole sorgeva ma senza fornire luminosità, come se fosse la Luna, per tutto l’anno”; scrisse all’epoca lo storico bizantino Procopio. Le temperature calarono di circa 2 gradi centigradi, dando via al decennio più freddo degli ultimi 2.300 anni.

Tutto questo, ovviamente, ebbe ulteriori conseguenze: la neve cadde in Cina in piena estate, ma soprattutto i raccolti – a causa della mancanza di sole – furono un disastro; provocando carestie in tutto l’emisfero settentrionale. Se non bastasse, nel 541, mentre la popolazione era ancora alle prese con la carestia, avvenne il colpo di grazia: la peste bubbonica colpì il porto romano di Pelusium (Egitto), diffondendosi rapidamente e uccidendo circa un terzo (secondo altre fonti anche metà) di tutta la popolazione dell’ex Impero Romano d’Occidente.

L’intera Europa precipitò in una depressione economica che durò oltre un secolo

Ma che cosa causò quella nebbia tanto fitta da impedire alla Terra di ricevere il calore del sole? Per lungo tempo, le ragioni sono state un mistero; ma proprio lo studio condotto da McCormick assieme al glaciologo Paul Mayewski dell’Università del Maine ha finalmente fornito una probabile risposta definitiva. A oscurare il Sole fu un’eruzione vulcanica avvenuta in Islanda agli inizi del 536; un’eruzione tanto potente da diffondere le sue ceneri su metà del globo. A questa, ne seguirono altre nel 540 e nel 547; il contemporaneo scoppio della peste fece precipitare l’intera Europa in una depressione economica che durò oltre un secolo.

McCormick, Mayewski e il loro team hanno deciso di cercare tracce di queste eruzioni nel ghiacciaio del Colle Gnifetti sulle Alpi svizzere. Il ghiacciaio conserva infatti più di 2000 anni di segni di eruzioni vulcaniche, tempeste di polvere del Sahara e attività umane avvenute nel centro dell'Europa. Per decifrare i dati conservati, è stato utilizzato un nuovo metodo ad altissima risoluzione, che sfrutta il laser per estrarre frammenti di ghiaccio di 120 micron (che rappresentano solo alcuni giorni o settimane di nevicate), permettendo di fornire una datazione estremamente precisa.

Nel ghiaccio risalente alla primavera del 536 sono state trovate due microscopiche particelle di vetro vulcanico. Bombardando i frammenti con i raggi X per determinare le loro impronte chimiche, si è scoperto che queste erano strettamente compatibili con le particelle di vetro già trovate in alcuni laghi e torbiere d’Europa e in un ghiacciaio della Groenlandia. Queste particelle a loro volta avevano moltissime similitudini con le rocce vulcaniche provenienti dall'Islanda; il che fa supporre – ma saranno necessarie altre conferme – che il vulcano che ha dato inizio all’anno peggiore di tutto i tempi si trovasse proprio in Islanda.

L’umanità potrebbe essere arrivata a un passo dall’estinzione

Detto questo, siamo davvero sicuri che non si possa individuare un altro anno ancor più terribile del 536? Per quanto non si possa datare con altrettanta precisione, circa 70mila anni fa l’incredibile eruzione (la più potente degli ultimi 25 milioni di anni) avvenuta dal supervulcano che si trova al di sotto del lago di Toba (vicino all’odierna Sumatra) rese quasi invivibile il clima del pianeta, che già allora stava attraversando una glaciazione. Per avere un’idea, durante questa eruzione vennero espulsi 2.800 chilometri cubici di cenere e polvere; durante l’eruzione che causò la fine di Pompei, invece, ne furono espulsi solo tre.



Le conseguenze furono drammatiche: in alcune zone, la temperatura si abbassò anche di 20 gradi e di tutti gli uomini presenti sulla Terra (all’epoca non solo Sapiens e concentrati quasi esclusivamente in Africa) ne restarono poco più di duemila; il che potrebbe anche essere all’origine della nostra scarsa differenziazione genetica. L’umanità, insomma, potrebbe essere arrivata a un passo dall’estinzione. Quale che sia stato davvero l’anno peggiore della nostra storia, queste vicende ci insegnano due cose: che anche l’uomo può sparire dalla faccia della Terra, e che è meglio non sottovalutare le eruzioni vulcaniche.

SCARPE UOMO: I MODELLI INVERNALI CHE VORRAI COMPRARE ORA

Ormai lo stanno dicendo tutti: le sneakers sembrano aver fatto il loro tempo, la bolla delle scarpe sportive sta per scoppiare, anche perché sono onnipresenti e hanno stufato, e per l'inverno 2019 si torna volentieri alle scarpe eleganti. Se è vero, tanto vale prepararsi, ricominciando a collezionare le calzature classiche, da adulti, che in realtà non sono mai passate di moda.

Pubblicità - Continua a leggere di seguito

Avremo anche ammesso scarpe da tennis e dad sneakers sotto i completi eleganti e i pantaloni sartoriali, ma le stringate classiche come Derby e Oxford, oltre agli immancabili mocassini e gli stivaletti, stanno tornando alla grande. Ecco quindi le 6 scarpe eleganti da avere nell'armadio per il 2019.

1 - Oxford, le scarpe da uomo più eleganti al mondo

Courtesy Prada

Le Oxford sono le scarpe maschili più formali, quelle adatte allo smoking e agli abiti da cerimonia. Non è un caso che la guida delle scarpe da uomo eleganti cominci con loro. Le scarpe Oxford di Prada in pelle nera spazzolata, ad esempio, sono un ottimo modo di cominciare l'inverno. In alternativa, puoi optare per le scarpe Derby, quasi uguali alle Oxford ma più diffuse e più comode da indossare. Come non ricordare, ad esempio, Shannon, la Derby per eccellenza di Chruch's?

2 - Scarpe Derby di pelle, l'unica alternativa alle Oxford

Courtesy Bally

Se le Oxford risultano troppo formali, dirotta la scelta su un paio di Derby. La differenza è nei lembi di pelle della tomaia che ospitano l'allacciatura, che nelle Oxford sono rigidi e nelle Derby invece si dilatano, liberando la linguetta. Anche per questo motivo, le Derby sono più confortevoli, amate da chiunque debba indossare scarpe eleganti in ufficio. Per l'inverno 2019 meglio scegliere quelle in pelle marrone sfumato sulla punta, di Bally, che faranno la differenza rispetto ai modelli classici. In generale, quando si tratta di scarpe dall'eleganza rilassata, gli uomini si dividono tra amanti delle Derby e affezionati dei mocassini.

3 - Mocassini di camoscio per l'inverno 2019: l'opzione rilassata

Courtesy Tod's

I mocassini, nella variante tradizionale dei penny loafers o in tutte le versioni in camoscio, più o meno decorati, sono la vera risposta alla rilassatezza delle sneakers, ma nel reame dell'eleganza. Comodi e adatti a qualunque look, anche quelli casual, i mocassini di Tod's in camoscio marrone scuro sono perfetti in città ma anche in vacanza, a una festa elegante o a un incontro informale tra amici. Il vero jolly dell'inverno, assieme ai Chelsea boots.

4 - Chelsea boots, gli stivaletti più chic

Nella marea di stivaletti che ci vengono offerti ogni inverno, tra anfibi di pelle e scelte più eleganti, i più interessanti sono sempre i Chelsea boots. Amati da generazioni di uomini, sono duttili come poche scarpe al mondo, con quell'elastico che si può mostrare per essere più casual o nascondere per diventare immediatamente più chic. Con gli stivaletti Chelsea si sono sbizzarriti tutti i brand, ma qui ti consigliamo di restare sul classico con un twist, con la pelle nera di Brioni e il proverbiale elastico laterale rivisitato in un altro formato.

5 - Brogue di Church's, una stringata diversa

Courtesy Church's

Le Brogue sono le stringate con le tipiche perforature sulla tomaia a fare da decoro, il dettaglio di stile che le distingue dalle Derby. Più difficili da abbinare proprio perché più elaborate delle Derby, queste stringate in pelle o camoscio movimentano il look, tanto da rendersi adatte a outfit autunnali a strati, più smart casual che formali. L'ideale è abbinarle comunque a dei pantaloni sartoriali, anche se fanno un'ottima figura con pantaloni chino e blu jeans.

6 - Monk strap, la terza via rispetto a mocassini e stringate

Courtesy Berluti

Le monk strap shoes non sono altro che le scarpe con la fibbia, mono o doppia, che rappresentano la terza via alle stringate o ai mocassini (tecnicamente, i Chelsea boots sono mocassini così come gli stivaletti allacciati sono delle stringate). Amate inizialmente dagli alternativi, per qualche stagione sono state la nuova regola, tanto da rendere paradossalmente più originali le Derby o addirittura le Oxford. Ultimamente sembravano tornate in ombra, ma questo modello in pelle di Berluti fa venir voglia di ritirarle fuori dall'armadio.

IL TARTAN DELLA MODA UOMO INVERNO 2019 NON È PIÙ LO STESSO

Le classiche stampe a quadri della moda uomo, dal Principe di Galles al tartan, dominano da anni le passerelle, e per quanto riguarda le tendenze dell’autunno inverno 2018 2019 non sarà diverso. Soprattutto per il tartan, che torna alla ribalta con un plus.

È quasi impossibile ricordare un momento in cui il tartan non è apparso sulle passerelle invernali, ma questa volta, reinterpretato, ha un gusto tutto nuovo: il motivo check della tradizione scozzese dei clan ha riabbracciato il suo spirito più ribelle, quello adottato dai punk londinesi sin dagli anni 70.

Da Alexander McQueen, che ne ha fatto un segno di riconoscimento, e che questa stagione lo rivisita in una collezione ispirata allo stile british, a Versace che lo propone variopinto e in color block, per arrivare al tartan di Dries Van Noten su un particolare kilt, un ibrido sartoriale tra pantalone e gonna.

Non mancano però gli elementi bon ton, come la cravatta tartan, ideale per un look natalizio o comunque festivo, da abbinare con elementi più sobri come una semplice camicia bianca e una giacca essenziale, possibilmente scura.

DAVE EGGERS HA SCRITTO UNA FAVOLA URBANA PER TUTTE LE ETÀ

È con La porta di mezzanotte che Dave Eggers – tra i più importanti scrittori americani della contemporaneità, dall'esordio con L’opera struggente di un formidabile genio (2001) a Il Cerchio, e fondatore della prestigiosa rivista e casa editrice McSweeney’s – si cimenta, riuscendovi, in una favola moderna dal sapore dell’urban legend, dalle robuste venature fantastiche, accompagnata persino dalle illustrazioni lugubri e avvincenti di Aaron Renier, che ricordano alla lontana quelle bianco e nero del maestro Kubin dell’Altra parte.

Pubblicità - Continua a leggere di seguito

Il libro (edito da Mondadori e tradotto da Fabio Paracchini), è per i ragazzi dai 10 ai 14 anni, tuttavia è adatto anche a un pubblico adulto, proprio come il precedente Le creature selvagge che Eggers aveva tratto dal capolavoro di Maurice Sendak. Qui si narra di Granito Flowerpetal, un dodicenne solitario, il quale si trasferisce con la famiglia in un paesino dimenticato dallo strambo nome: Carosello. Asociale ma desideroso di amici, abile nella strana arte di maneggiare l’argilla (manualità preziosa ereditata dalla madre ex imbalsamatrice), attira le attenzioni, nella scuola del posto, della misteriosa e sicura Catalina Catalan.

Ma anche il nome granito aveva qualche problema. Gran doveva spiegarlo a tutti quelli che incontrava. Di solito doveva sillabarlo. Se si fosse chiamato Michael o Derrick non ci sarebbe stato bisogno di fermarsi a spiegare, sillabare o discutere la natura dei nomi, dei nomi insoliti e di come ti vengono appioppati.

La ragazzina si lega pian piano a Gran, il quale non demorde nel conquistare la sua fiducia. Catalina però cela un segreto fatto di responsabilità e di mirabolanti magie necessarie per salvare il mondo. Lei è infatti una Sollevatrice, ovvero una combattente dei Vuoti, cioè quelle potenze del sottosuolo che divaricano da tempo il terreno della cittadina – centro nevralgico del male – inghiottendo ciò che dimora in superficie: case, vie, alberi. I Vuoti sentono deliziosa la tristezza degli esseri umani e perciò risalgono da sottoterra, da cunicoli, per cibarsene.

courtesy Mondadori

Sarà compito dei ragazzini - del posto e non solo - lottare, armati fino ai denti, contro le forze malefiche, aprendo le porte dei tunnel, e fermare così l’ascesa dei Vuoti. Bambini che discendono temerari contro i Vuoti che si muovono secondo una tensione in verticale; insomma, il Male che dagli inferi di una tipica cittadina americana (eco particellare di IT?) risale perché vuole mangiare il Bene il quale beato vive in orizzontale.

Di questa dura e fantastica impresa infantile – ma che per portata sentimentale tocca anime senili, complice la lingua asciutta, melodiosa e placida dello scrittore americano che si inventa cantastorie pungente, underground – sarà forse la chiave di volta lo stesso Granito, di nome e forse finalmente di fatto?

Catalina iniziò a muovere la mano lentissimamente in circolo sulla schiena di Gran e anche se non riusciva ancora a respirare bene, lui pensò che ne era valsa la pena.

UOMINI A GAMBE LARGHE E TROLL RUSSI: LO STRANO CASO DELLA DOPPIA FAKE NEWS

Versare candeggina sul cavallo dei pantaloni dei maschi addormentati in metro non è - possiamo essere tutti d’accordo - il modo migliore per aiutare la causa femminista: se teniamo a conquistare le masse, perlomeno. Eppure il video che mostrava l’azione dell’attivista russa Anna Dovgalyuk, nella metropolitana di San Pietroburgo, mentre puniva gli uomini che si sedevano con le gambe aperte occupando più spazio di quanto avrebbero dovuto, aveva fatto il giro del mondo.

Pubblicità - Continua a leggere di seguito

Qualche infervorato, in realtà, si era davvero convinto che quello fosse un modo costruttivo di affrontare il manspreading, piuttosto che nuova benzina - quasi in senso letterale - sull’incendio del populismo. E così, partendo da del liquido irritante gettato sull’inguine di sconosciuti, incappiamo in qualcosa che potrebbe farci esplodere la testa: la geopolitica tra superpotenze e le nuove frontiere dello spazio culturale globale.

Questa storia incredibile, che merita di finire una ipotetica Top 10 delle più significative del 2018 (Sezione: “Costume e Società”) era cominciata con la stessa Dovgalyuk che aveva caricato il video sui social. Lei ha 20 anni, fa la modella e studia legge. L’abitudine di sedersi occupando troppo spazio, ha spiegato, “è un atto di violenza di genere e una totale mancanza di rispetto per le donne sedute vicine". Gli uomini fatti bersaglio nel blitz - una settantina - erano stati quasi tutti colti di sorpresa, alcuni hanno reagito con stupore, altri con rabbia. La miscela spruzzata era a base di cloro diluito in acqua: abbastanza per lasciare una macchia, ma non per causare ferimenti.

Era appena il secondo video del genere realizzato da Dovgalyuk: in quello precedente si vedeva un’altra modella girare in metropolitana con la gonna alzata, in segno di protesta contro l’upskirt, ovvero la perversione di fotografare o filmare, dal basso verso l’altro, senza permesso, la biancheria intima femminile. Successone sui social pure quello, ma niente di comparabile con il video sul manspreading, che viene rilanciato immediatamente da siti di informazione legati al governo russo come In The NOW o Russia Today e poi ripreso da centinaia di pagine satiriche e non, siti di destra, cittadini comuni, raccogliendo milioni di visualizzazioni e trasformando la sua autrice in una star oggetto di ammirazione in alcuni casi, di derisione o disprezzo in molti di più. Dopo qualche giorno il video è stato rimosso.

Pubblicità - Continua a leggere di seguito

Con la notorietà del video, però, sono arrivate all’autrice anche delle domande: qual è davvero il suo scopo? A chi stava cercando di parlare? Era davvero un modo per aiutare la causa femminista, oppure era tutta una presa per i fondelli? Se sì, chi c’era dietro? Possibile - fantastica qualcuno - che gli strateghi di Mosca non abbiano nulla di meglio da fare che stuzzicare la cattiveria dei commentatori con un tema apparentemente così frivolo? La storia ha preso una piega inaspettata quando un sito finanziato dall’Unione Europea per combattere le fake news, EUvsDisinfo, ha chiamato il video senza mezzi termini “messinscena della propaganda russa”.

Ci sono tuttora diversi indizi a corroborare questa tesi: un’intervista realizzata da una rivista online di San Pietroburgo, con un signore che dice di essere stato pagato per sedersi in quel treno e farsi spruzzare; le dichiarazioni ambigue della stessa Dovgalyuk, nel video, che dice di essere stata aiutata da “amici che condividono la mia posizione”; e soprattutto, il fatto che il video sia stato diffuso, editato e “ribrandizzato” proprio da una piattaforma ambigua come In the NOW, che ha tre milioni di like su Facebook ed è, effettivamente, nata come una costola di Russia Today, canale tv e online che da sempre viene finanziato dal Cremlino. Proprio come un altro sito di news, Sputnik, che tra l’altro ha aperto qualche anno fa sede in Italia, e che pur con tutta la carità interpretativa del mondo non si può definire altro che un piccolo megafono di un regime autoritario.

Ragioniamoci un attimo. La teoria è davvero allucinante: un video sul manspreading diviene parte della strategia di Mosca per insolentire, agitare, insomma triggerare l’Occidente, infervorare il dibattito bombardandolo di indignazione fasulla, vale a dire dimostrando come il femminismo dei Paesi sviluppati sia andato troppo oltre. Ci dev’essere del genio in tutto questo. In seguito, però, Dovgalyuk ha respinto ogni accusa: sia quella di aver assunto attori, sia quella di essere sul libro paga di qualcuno. Tutti i media che sono tornati sulla notizia hanno comunque riportato la spiegazione dei demistificatori europei.

La BBC, a quel punto, ha mandato i suoi reporter a indagare, scoprendo che alcune parti del debunking non tornano. Innanzitutto, il presunto attore intervistato dalla rivista russa non si fa più trovare, e tutti i suoi profili social sono stati cancellati. Quelli di In the NOW, che ha sede ufficiale a Berlino, ammettono sì di avere il governo russo per mecenate, ma spiegano anche di essere più interessati ai contenuti “virali” che alla politica, e di avere una certa indipendenza editoriale: chi non avrebbe approfittato di quel video per monetizzare qualche clic in più? Nel frattempo il sito EUvsDisinfo rifiuta qualsiasi confronto, e dall’ambasciata russa a Londra fanno sapere di non avere idea di quale accidente di messaggio volesse lanciare quel video.

Certo, Anna Dovgalyuk è tutto tranne che una femminista sullo stile delle Pussy Riots, o delle attiviste anglosassoni ed europee: è un’ammiratrice di Putin, una nazionalista sfegatata che tempesta i suoi profili di hashtag patriottici. A dire il vero, sentita dalla BBC, lei ha spiegato di non essere nemmeno femminista: “Oggi il femminismo non ha a che fare nulla con l’uguaglianza ma piuttosto col risentimento, con l’odio nei confronti degli uomini”, ha detto. “Non mi piace molto questa parola, per il modo in cui è stata distorta”. Del resto, commentano i giornalisti britannici, questa “è una lettura che riecheggia spesso in Russia nei media ufficiali: quella che vede il femminismo come un’ideologia occidentale focalizzata sull’odio per gli uomini, incompatibile con i valori e la cultura tradizionali dei russi”. A quel punto però hanno chiesto a Dovgalyuk se qualche poliziotto l’abbia fermata per il suo gesto. Lei ha spiegato di essere stata portata in una stazione di polizia, ma ha rifiutato di dire il nome. Le forze dell’ordine di San Pietroburgo ripetono: non ci risulta alcun fermo contro Dovgalyuk negli archivi, nulla, nisba, nyet.

Un momento, però, fermi tutti: non è proprio questo l’obiettivo dei troll reazionari? Farci contorcere su controversie artificiose?

Come potrete intuire, neppure la BBC è riuscita a eliminare tutti i dubbi: abbiamo capito che il video è molto meno autentico di quanto sembri a prima vista, ma sono ridimensionate parecchio anche le accuse dei russofobi. Resta però - intatta e più sconveniente che mai - la sensazione che stiamo assistendo a un importante cambio di passo nella strategia del trolling politico. Perché l’effetto disturbante di questa storia, ciò che la rende davvero emblematica, è che contiene elementi di plausibilità in entrambe le ipotesi sul tavolo.

Quel video - ammettiamolo - era tanto credibile così come lo era l’ipotesi del complotto. Perché sono almeno tre anni che il manspreading è il tormento delle blogger, viene stigmatizzato di continuo su Twitter, occupa intere inchieste del New York Times, è al centro di campagne di sensibilizzazione delle società che gestiscono le metropolitane, e ha nientemeno dato vita a notizie incontrollate sui primi arresti per gambe tenute troppo aperte. Tutto legittimo, per carità. Molti di noi ci hanno riso su, anche perché il dibattito si è mantenuto quasi sempre sull’ironico andante, con disamine sulla peculiare conformazione del corpo maschile, andrologi esperti che smentivano ogni complotto sul riscaldamento genitale e proposte per sanzionare gli eccessi più o meno goliardiche. Eppure, sapevamo che non tutti l’avrebbero presa così.

Sapevamo che una parte della classe media e non solo avrebbe vissuto come un affronto, come un inganno, come l’ennesimo spostamento dell’attenzione mediatica e del discorso pubblico su un elemento futile, mentre la propria condizione marginale veniva in qualche modo silenziata, o veniva percepita come tale. Esageriamo? Anche i più progressisti di noi sapevano bene che possono esistere forme di attivismo radicale capaci di spingersi fino a questi estremi. Il fatto stesso che molti abbiano ritenuto quell’azione credibile e abbiano fatto il tifo per l’eroina col cloro ci costringe a interrogarci: sul modo di fare militanza, sulla distorsione di certi messaggi politici, sulle priorità da dare a certe battaglie.

Non è poi così assurdo: se manca l’evidenza che Anna Dovgalyuk abbia ricevuto soldi dal Cremlino è impressionante come, per un automatismo che non fallisce mai, molti cosiddetti sovranisti, radicalizzati antifemministi, rossobruni vari e liberalofobi si siano affrettati a condividere il video, per deriderne il contenuto: come se non vedessero l’ora, come se non cercassero altra occasione per cantarne quattro ai movimenti figli di questa cultura fricchettona che ha stufato tutti.

Lasciamo stare gli account di Twitter scrutinati per aver fatto propaganda pro-Trump o contro Clinton durante le presidenziali americane del 2016 - per ora sono poche migliaia, e non è ancora chiaro quanto abbiano influenzato il voto. Pensiamo però alle pagine Facebook secondo molti esperti legate al Cremlino che hanno triggerato in altri modi, comprovati, la polemica politica locale: ad esempio, promuovendo cortei pro-Islam e, al tempo stesso, anti-Islam in una medesima cittadina del Texas, sponsorizzando hashtag in favore della secessione della California, oppure aizzando polemiche a sfondo razziale sulla scelta degli attori di Star Wars: Gli ultimi Jedi.

Secondo un ricercatore della University of Southern California, almeno il 50% delle critiche arrivate online nei confronti degli autori di non sarebbe altro che il frutto di troll/hacker russi che "sostengono le cause dell’estrema destra e la discriminazione per gender, razza o sessualità". La nuova frontiera del trolling potrebbe essere questa: infilarsi come una lama nelle discussioni online più animate, per incrementare la copertura mediatica dei conflitti socioculturali, e amplificare i tratti disfuzionali della cultura occidentale. Una strategia inseguita da diversi anni dall’alt-right occidentale, certo, ma non è stato così anche con i poliziotti infiltrati nei movimenti ambientalisti, pacifisti, comunisti e sindacalisti per decenni? La memoria storica ci costringe ad essere vigili, ma anche sobri.

Quel che è chiaro, al di là della coda polemica e del precedente settato dal video dell’attivista russa, è che sia la sfrontatezza di una YouTuber di 20 anni, sia la solerzia dei debunker possono essere animate da ossessioni ideologiche che ci lasciano esausti, divisi e irregimentati in una guerra sempre più strisciante e non convenzionale. Ne usciamo, in definitiva, più fiaccati: nei confronti di qualsiasi tipo di informazione.

LUBIAM, IL BRAND MADE IN MANTOVA CHE CREDE NEL MECENATISMO

L.B.M. 1911 è un’eccellenza del made in Italy nel settore della moda uomo, una realtà presente a Mantova appunto dal 1911, che da sempre ha un forte legame con il territorio. Non è un caso che gli abiti sartoriali portino fieramente la sigla “Made in Mantova”, a testimoniare la volontà dell’azienda e della famiglia di contribuire in modo significativo all’economia della città, non solo tramite la moda ma attraverso iniziative culturali come quello che lega Lubiam e la storia dei Gonzaga: I Gonzaga Digitali 5.

I Gonzaga Digitali 5 – I Gonzaga e la Moda tra Mantova e l’Europa si inserisce in una lunga tradizione di iniziative culturali che da tempo intrecciano il brand maschile con l’arte, una vocazione che si è tradotta in molteplici attività portate avanti con spirito di mecenatismo: per esempio, la ristrutturazione del complesso domenicano di Susano, il restauro delle 52 sculture polimateriche della Basilica delle Grazie, la valorizzazione e l’esposizione negli spazi aziendali di quadri di valore come la tela seicentesca La cacciata dell’invitato indegno, che faceva parte della collezione dei Gonzaga, e le opere di Ferruccio Bolognesi.

Non ultima, l’istituzione del Premio Lubiam, che dal 1972 rappresenta un punto di confronto di tendenze fra le Accademie di Belle Arti d’Italia. La moda autunno inverno 2018 2019 di L.B.M. 1911, poi, è all’insegna del blu pavone: la tonalità luminosa è infatti proposta su una selezione di giacche e cappotti ispirati alle tinte cangianti e alle sfumature iridescenti del peacock blue, che si distingue per la sua intensità e per il suo grande impatto, senza eccedere, mantenendo sempre un'allure sofisticata, moderna e minimalista.

PALLONE D'ORO, LA CADUTA DELL'ANCIEN RÉGIME

Era dal 2006 che nei primi tre posti della classifica per il Pallone d'Oro non figurava almeno uno tra Lionel Messi e Cristiano Ronaldo. Due anni più tardi sarebbe iniziata l'egemonia del meraviglioso dualismo che ha riscritto la storia contemporanea del calcio internazionale. Dieci Balon d'Or, equamente suddivisi in cinque per ciascuna bacheca, con i due medesimi protagonisti a conquistarlo, a turno: Ronaldo, Messi, Messi, Messi, Messi, Ronaldo, Ronaldo, Messi, Ronaldo, Ronaldo. Leo non ha mai mancato il podio in questi dodici anni, Cristiano soltanto in un'occasione, nel 2010. Era dal 2006, per altro, che i primi tre posti nella corsa all'ambito trofeo non venivano occupati da altrettanti protagonisti della finale Mondiale: Kylian Mbappé e Raphael Varane a rappresentare la Francia campione, Luka Modric per la Croazia sconfitta in finale.

Nel 2010 vinse Messi, tra le polemiche, di fronte ad Iniesta e Xavi, cuore del centrocampo nella Spagna mundial in Sudafrica. Nel 2014 davanti a tutti c'è Ronaldo e nella Germania campione in Brasile brilla soltanto Neuer, a chiudere il podio. Quest'anno, invece, ecco un'importante e clamorosa inversione di tendenza. Escluso senza troppe sorprese Messi, che nel 2018 ha fatto incetta di trofei soltanto in patria, con Liga, Copa del Rey e Supercoppa nel Barcellona. Escluso tra il clamore generale Ronaldo, che ha conquistato la quinta Champions League in carriera, la terza consecutiva per il Real Madrid, segnando almeno un gol nelle prime dieci partite della competizione. Mbappé, Modric, Varane: questi, in rigoroso ordine alfabetico, i tre nomi per il Pallone d'Oro.

Andando ad analizzare soltanto il palmares collezionato durante il 2018, Varane si presenta da favorito. Il difensore è entrato nel novero degli undici giocatori di sempre in grado di conquistare Champions League e Mondiale nella medesima stagione. Di questi, ben sette risalgono all'accoppiata Bayern Monaco-Germania del 1974: Beckenbauer, Breitner, Hoeness, Kapelmann, Maier, Gerd Muller, Schwarzenbeck. A loro si aggiungono cinque giocatori che hanno conquistato la Champions con il Real Madrid e il Mondiale con le rispettive Nazionali: Karembeu con la Francia nel 1998, Roberto Carlos con il Brasile nel 2002, Sami Khedira con la Germania nel 2014 e, appunto, Varane con la Francia quest'anno. Non che il 2018 di Mbappé e Modric sia stato meno soddisfacente: il primo ha conquistato e a tratti dominato il Mondiale, oltre a festeggiare altri quattro trofei con il Paris Saint-Germain, mentre il secondo ha vinto la Champions da protagonista e ha raggiunto l'ultimo atto in Russia, perdendo da capitano e leader della sua Croazia.

Individualmente, ognuno dei candidati porta con sé caratteristiche, numeri e prestazioni impressionanti, oltre ad almeno un aspetto negativo, come normale nell'analisi di un'intera annata sul terreno di gioco. Varane ha giocato una prima parte di stagione ai limiti della perfezione. In Champions League ha perfino oscurato il compagno di reparto Sergio Ramos con prestazioni sopraffine, arrivando ad annullare Lewandowski in semifinale contro il Bayern Monaco e a limitare ai minimi il talento di Firmino in finale contro il Liverpool.

Poi, un Mondiale da miglior difensore della competizione. Sei gol subiti in sette partite per la Francia: uno su rigore dall'Australia, dopo il folle tocco di mano in area di Umtiti, tre su quattro tiri nello specchio dall'Argentina negli ottavi, due infine dalla Croazia, compresa una clamorosa topica di Lloris. Nel mezzo, quattro clean sheet, con Varane impressionante soprattutto contro Uruguay e Belgio. La successiva stagione con il Real Madrid, però, non è stata fin qui all'altezza e Varane ha toccato il fondo, con una prestazione ai limiti del ridicolo, nel Clasico perso per 5-1 contro il Barcellona.

Lo stesso punto a sfavore, un 2018/19 fin qui incredibilmente ai margini, si presenta nell'annata di Modric. Appena 1.117 minuti giocati in totale, con 3 assist e senza alcun gol segnato. Nel complesso, però, il croato ha rappresentato il prototipo ideale del centrocampista moderno: leader in mezzo al campo, personalità abbinata a una tecnica sopraffina, con corsa e visione di gioco, geometrie e qualità al tiro. Dopo aver estiasiato il mondo nella finale di Kiev con il Real Madrid, Modric ha portato il proprio talento sul palcoscenico mondiale. Ammutolita l'Argentina nei gironi, imbrigliata l'Inghilterra in semifinale, dopo il grande spavento del rigore sbagliato nei supplementari contro la Danimarca negli ottavi. In finale, forza e fisicità del centrocampo francese ne hanno limitato l'efficacia, togliendo al croato anche la certezza di questo Pallone d'Oro. Anche se, dopo i titoli di Uefa Men's Player of the Year e di Best Fifa Men's Player, il premio più importante sembrerebbe quasi d'obbligo.

Getty Images

Così come pare d'obbligo che lo vinca in futuro, forse più che in questa edizione, Mbappé. Già a 19 anni, però, il suo nome è tutt'altro che utopia su questo clamoroso podio. A Parigi ha collezionato una stagione d'esordio da 22 gol in 33 partite, dopo un salto nel vuoto da 180 milioni di euro la scorsa estate, con l'addio al Monaco. Un deludente PSG si è arreso al Real negli ottavi di Champions, ma ha fatto en-plein di trofei in patria: Ligue 1, Coppa di Lega, Coppa di Francia e Supercoppa. Mbappé, però, ha soprattutto vissuto un Mondiale sublime, a tratti mostrando una dominanza spaventosa per un calciatore della sua età. Doppietta con assist all'Argentina negli ottavi, gol e assist nella pazzesca finale contro la Croazia. In tutto, oltre agli innumerevoli record di precocità superati tra club e Nazionale, 10 gol con la Francia nel solo 2018, primo a raggiungere la doppia cifra in 365 giorni dai tempi sua maestà Thierry Henry.

Difficile, dunque, dare un'opinione valida in senso assoluto su chi meriti questo Pallone d'Oro. Dopo dieci anni di assolutismo del dualismo Messi-Ronaldo, è facile ritrovarsi senza una bussola, senza punti di riferimento. La realtà è che, comunque vada, il trofeo assegnato rappresenterà un passo storico, per il presente e il futuro del calcio internazionale. E, probabilmente, può bastare così.

GLI OCCHIALI DA SOLE PER L'INVERNO 2019

Non c'è bisogno dell'estate per indossare un buon paio di occhiali da sole, è sufficiente qualche timido raggio, e infatti anche per l'inverno 2019 i brand propongono una scelta di montature di tutte le fogge, i colori e le caratteristiche. L'importante è non rendersi ridicoli indossando gli occhiali quando ci sono soltanto pioggia e nuvole, per il resto, ecco le montature da provare e cercare per l'inverno 2019.

Tom Ford, uno dei brand più amati quando si tratta di eyewear, propone una montatura anni 60 con lenti solo leggermente scurite, visto che i raggi del sole invernale sono così deboli da non richiedere schermature totali.

Tom Ford Courtesy Tom Ford

In alternativa si possono scegliere degli occhiali con lenti sfumate, come quelli di Neubau Eyewear, che rafforza il concetto con una montatura tonda, adatta a chi ha un volto più pieno. Proprio questo accessorio è indicato per diversificare un outfit autunnale o invernale magari troppo scuro, o serioso.

Neubau Eyewear Courtesy Neubau Eyewear

Un altro brand molto cercato quando si tratta di eyewear è Prada, che si sdoppia anche con la sua ritrovata Linea Rossa. Per l'inverno 2019 il pezzo di punta è però un occhiale grigio, con lenti chiare, a metà strada tra il modello Aviator e quello tondo. Indicato, appunto, per chi in inverno veste soltanto di colori scuri.

Chi cerca montature dalla forma più particolare può rivolgersi a Moscot, celebre ottico di New York che sta ampliando la sua presenza sul mercato tradizionale grazie a un grande heritage e un'expertise altrettanto invidiabile.

Moscot Courtesy Moscot

Gli occhiali da sole di Excape in cellulosa borgogna e lenti sfumate in tinta, invece, sono perfetti per chi ama abbinare gli accessori al look, visto che gli abiti borgogna e le tinte terree come il marrone sono i colori preferiti di questa stagione fredda.

Excape Courtesy Excape

E chiudiamo con gli occhiali da sole per eccellenza, quelli di Persol, che ha realizzato una speciale capsule collection con l'intento di rivisitare il modello pieghevole 714, reso famoso da Steve McQueen nel film Il caso Thomas Crown. Per nostalgici, ma anche per affezionati dei cult dell'eyewear.

LE COSE DA NON DIMENTICARE MAI QUANDO SI FA UN VOLO LUNGO

Ci sono viaggi lunghi, e poi ci sono viaggi davvero lunghi. Lunghissimi. C’è chi per due o tre ore di treno si lamenta, perché si annoia, il tempo sembra non passare mai - o troppo lentamente - e così si ritrova ad aver voglia di alzarsi dal sedile e fare qualcosa, ma ovviamente da fare c’è ben poco.

Pubblicità - Continua a leggere di seguito

Ma di viaggi ce ne sono di ben più lunghi, soprattutto per chi valica i limiti del continente europeo. Sì perché se le tratte come quelle da Roma a Parigi, o da Milano a Barcellona durano non più di qualche ora, ce ne sono degli altre per cui ci vogliono dieci, dodici, perfino diciotto ore. Un’intera giornata in viaggio, con di mezzo, spesso, pure la nottata da fare sistemati alla buona tra zaini, sedili non proprio comodissimi e russanti sconosciuti.

Getty Images

A proposito di lunghezza, giusto poco tempo fa è stata diffusa la notizia che sarà disponibile molto presto la tratta Sydney - Londra, un volo diretto che si aggirerà sulle venti ore, su per giù. Sono tempi molto lunghi, che rendono le nostre lamentele per il treno Roma-Milano decisamente esagerate.

Ma tutto è relativo, soprattutto in viaggio. Chi per lavoro, interessi personali o la presenza di affetti e familiari si reca spesso nel sud del continente americano, in Oceania o magari nel sud dell’Africa, conosce la risposta psicologica e corporea a una semi-immobilità autoimposta che può durare più di una dozzina d’ore, e se è vero che viaggi in nave o in bus possono durare molto di più, è vero altrettanto che in quei casi non si è costretti in spazi così angusti - in bus sì, ma almeno ci sono le soste.

Per chi affronta uno di questi voli lunghissimi ci sono alcune cose da portare con sé, oggetti che aiutano a ingannare il tempo e garantiscono una sopportazione meno difficile dello scorrere delle ore.

Libri, musica, film e serie TV

Tutte le compagnie aeree che si occupano di lunghi tragitti offrono delle cuffiette e uno schermo sistemato sul retro del poggiatesta di chi ci sta davanti. L’accesso a una serie di film, serie TV e altri programmi è gratuito, si hanno quasi sempre i sottotitoli (attenzione al “quasi”, dipende tutto dalla compagnia) e questo può essere un ottimo modo di passare il nostro tempo.

C’è però una cosa da tener presente: quello schermo non ha mai una buona risoluzione, quelle cuffie non hanno mai un audio paragonabile a quello delle cuffie che usiamo di solito e quei film, beh, potrebbero non piacerci. Succede anche che ci siano delle ultime uscite, ma vanno comunque viste e ascoltate in pessima qualità. La soluzione è portare in aereo, nel bagaglio a mano, un laptop o un tablet con musica, film e serie TV scaricate nei giorni precedenti.

Netflix, per esempio, è disponibile sui dispositivi degli abbonati anche se non si è connessi, perché esiste l’opzione per usufruire dei contenuti sul dispositivo anche da offline. Questa è un’opzione decisamente migliore - anche perché ogni volta che c’è una scena importante di ciò che stiamo vedendo sullo schermo della compagnia, c’è da star sicuri che verremo interrotti da un annuncio del comandante che lo interrompe in automatico.

Batterie e caricatori

Visto che abbiamo deciso di dotarci di audio e video senza contare su quelli offerti dalla compagnia aerea, è meglio ricordarsi di caricatori e cavi. Che sia quello per lo smartphone o quello per il tablet cambia poco: in un volo particolarmente lungo, se usiamo il dispositivo a lungo e soprattutto se usiamo la riproduzione di video, succederà che si scaricherà. Meglio avere tutti i cavi necessari e arrivare a bordo, possibilmente, con ogni dispositivo ben carico.

Siccome esiste la probabilità che a bordo non ci siano prese elettriche (occhio all’attacco, potrebbe essere quello a due entrate, mentre quello italiano ne ha tre e potrebbe rivelarsi inutile) è meglio avere con sé un powerbank. Cioè l’aggeggio che serve a ricaricare i nostri dispositivi attraverso una batteria esterna, senza bisogno di prese di corrente.

Tappi per le orecchie

Chi non porta a bordo di un lungo volo i tappi per le orecchie può essere solamente due cose: un santo o un ingenuo. Perché bisogna essere dei santi per sopportare sedici ore in mezzo a sconosciuti che russano, mangiano patatine e urlano per comunicare agli amici seduti sei file più avanti che si stanno annoiando. Oppure, appunto, degli ingenui, perché si era sottovalutato il problema e il grado di stress causato dal dormire a intervalli irregolari di quindici minuti circa ciascuno.

C’è un’ottima alternativa ai tappi (che non fanno benissimo alla struttura dell’orecchio) e sono le cuffie antirumore. In inglese si dice “noise-cancelling” nel senso che “cancellano”, per modo di dire, il rumore esterno. Non sono troppo diverse da quelle usate da chi lavora in ambienti molto rumorosi, e sono fatte appositamente per isolare le orecchie il più possibile dall’esterno.

Una coperta/cappotto

Non importa se è estate, primavera o se “ci sarà sicuramente il riscaldamento” l’aereo è un luogo in cui la temperatura varia imprevedibilmente. Vuoi perché a grandi altezze la temperatura esterna è molto bassa, vuoi per strani meccanismi di condensazione e deumidificazione dell’aria all’interno dell’abitacolo, si possono passare ore ed ore, soprattutto se ci si addormenta, a sentire freddo. Una coperta è ideale, anche se spesso le compagnie aeree per le ore notturne forniscono un plaid, ma questo rischia di non essere sufficiente. Se poi non si si userà come coperta andrà sempre bene come cuscino. Nei voli lunghi la necessità è praticamente da dare per scontata.

NOTHING IS COOL.

It’s been a week (to the hour) since you passed. I wanted to share some thoughts I’ve had this week while mourning you and experiencing my first real taste of absolute, gut-wrenching loss.

- This is so very worth it. I would change nothing. There wasn’t a day or even a span of hours in your life when you were taken for granted. There wasn’t any show of love that wasn’t reciprocated tenfold in either direction. This was the upside of having two dads that work from home and it’s why we’re all (yes, still) as bonded as we are. You resided mostly at our feet, helping us accomplish whatever task was at hand. You’d spend a couple hours in Dave’s office, then prompt him to let you come out to my studio for a bit, then reverse and repeat all day, every day. This was never a nuisance, never got old and never failed to fill us with as much joy as it did you. Naps were always the best and you were the best partner in the crime of day sleep. I’m having a lot of trouble napping on the huge beanbag - which you LOVED - without tears happening first. It’s been hard for both of us to sleep at night without you at the end of the bed, alternating whose legs you’ve got your back pressed up against. The prospect of bed-sharing is partly why I insisted on a non-shedding breed - the reason we were led to you - but I had no idea what else we were getting with the package.

- I am starting an entire, possibly larger, second phase of learning everything you were sent to teach me. It’s an awful lot and it’s weird to realize that in 40 years of living, some of the most basic things a human needs to know about themselves and the world can be non-verbally communicated through a uniquely gifted non-human like yourself. But then, you kinda were human. Given the amount of human activities we included you in, it’s not surprising that you practically changed teams. You never really fetched, had only a brief interest in any dog toys (certainly not for lack of us continuing to buy them), stayed closer to us off-leash than on, and try as we did with the food training, you just preferred to eat when we were eating. Like family. A couple times a day, you’d see or hear a squirrel and need to be immediately let out so you could run full bore at it, which was the most doglike activity you engaged in. (Wheatens are an Irish breed that chase vermin out of barns and off properties for their hardworking farmer/owners, so there it is. Who’s a good boy?!?)

- I keep thinking about an evening - around maybe 4 or 5 months of having you - when we were still crating you anytime we left the house. Because we were around so much, there was some separation anxiety to contend with early on. Dave remarked “He is 100% emotionally dependent on us and I guess we’ll have to address that.” Funny now to realize who was actually emotionally dependent on who, and how thoroughly you tricked us. I later taught you the phrase “You’re gonna stay here”, which made it easier for you to swallow the news of your not coming along with us wherever, find a comfy spot and enjoy some solo time. Because we all need solo time. That’s when you tended to do your heaviest sleeping, as you tried to be awake as much as possible when we were home. It was really, really hard to catch you with your eyes closed; maybe happened 3 times for me in those 10 years. (I have one picture of it, but this isn’t it. That one’s strictly between us.)

- Sneezing was your version of standup: it happened in groups of 8-or-so. But yours were as violent as my own, which both you and Dave can attest to. Your head would nearly shake right off of your neck, and between each one in the series you would have around 3 seconds to look right at us with a very concerned “Umm…what the HELL was that?” with all the hair on your face sticking out. Then onto the next until the fit subsided. You’d end up looking like mid-1980’s Tina Turner and it took you a few minutes of primping to get all the hair on your face back in place. Oh, we’re gonna miss you, you goof.

- Grieving- turns out we had no true experience in this department and you are teaching us a tremendously important life lesson. We’ve gotten into it. We’ve welcomed it, embraced it and let it run its course. No, I’m not done with it yet, but having surrendered to it the moment you passed, I’ve found it to be a pretty beautiful process. Don’t get me wrong, this is a kind of pain I didn’t know existed and I’m not excited about its next visit. I’ve now lost all 4 grandparents - the last one just a month ago, which hey…thanks for getting me through that, man - and 3 of them lived long, fruitful lives. There was an equal amount of celebration folded into the grief because of that long, full life. But Junes…you let us know something was wrong literally on your 10th birthday. (I’ve been having many bizarre thoughts about that, by the way.) Most sources told us that the Wheaten life expectancy is around 14-16 fully energetic years, so we had planned to do so much more with you. More trips to wine country, more trips to the beach, another NYC sublet for a few months, more dog park visits, more walks, more 3-mile runs and endless patio dining experiences all would have happened. And you wouldn’t have missed a beat so long as we were all together. Sure, we were lucky to not have lost you for whatever reason any sooner, but still. The bizarre, unforeseeable suddenness of your passing paired with your early exit has added many layers to our grief. Again, you are totally worth every exhausting moment of it, little man. And since you suffered only the briefest, if any, pain in the end, we have no problem bearing that load for you.

- Thank you for helping make Dave and I the people and couple that we are. It’s like your 12-week-old self showed up, said “These guys are doing pretty well, but they could use a little help; I’m just the guy for the job.” and just went to work. You sniffed out our incredible sensitivity the day we met you - which is why your sensitive self chose us - and once we became a family, you set about expanding our hearts while always filling them to the point they might burst any moment. It was love for each other and for you. My entire body has ached in flu-like fashion throughout the past week of grief, and I think it’s because my heart finally did burst and scatter throughout my being when you left us. We’re wrangling the many pieces of our hearts back into our chests and piecing them back together. The portion of it that binds the two of us stayed in place, is as strong as ever, and that’s partly your doing.

- Thank you for also growing so many others’ hearts. It’s impossible for non-owners of a dog - certainly for non-dog lovers - to have the same experience or connection its owners do, but you certainly gave that a run for its money. A few friends were lucky enough to housesit for us and get a glimpse of how little you asked for and how much you gave. When it was time to be happy and excited, you were. Otherwise, you just wanted to chill out together. You preferred smaller, more intimate hangs, but handled life in our ‘revolving door/borderline community center’ home with aplomb. When numbers got up there, you’d stick close to us or find an introverted soul hanging in the margins and cozy right up to them. I can think of at least 4 friends who began the search for their own dog after spending a little time around you and experiencing our family. You taught some of their dogs how to play and always shared your home with them remarkably well. We watched a variety of dogs for friends and you were a champ at making them feel right at home.

- Oh, buddy boy, I could go on forever. But it’s time to wrap this up. The thought of saying another Thank You or Goodbye instantly fills me with tears and heartache due to the finality of it. We already did that a week ago when we last got to touch you, smell you and clip a couple locks of hair from your ears. But if we’re to make these happy tears at some point, we have to accurately define your current and future status. We have to focus on the fact that you’re always going to be here with us. No, we can’t touch, smell, see or hear you anymore; those suddenly feel like selfish acts anyway. I now realize your real presence has always been just as strong, if not stronger, in the non-physical sense. You’re irremovably in our hearts, minds and souls. You will continue to live there, forever doing your best, most loving work.

WHO IS OMAR? HOW THE 24-YEAR-OLD FOUNDER OF @HOUSEOFHIGHLIGHTS FLIPPED SPORTS MEDIA ON ITS HEAD

.



When Omar Raja watches sports, he sees moments you and I cannot. It’s an impressive and hard-earned talent, but occasionally a fickle one, too. So just to be safe, the 24-year-old positions himself in front of two separate flatscreens in his tidy Hell’s Kitchen apartment and cranks the volume of NBA games to a near-abusive roar. His 65-inch television’s display is arranged in a grid, so that four contests can play simultaneously. A smaller screen, mounted on a nearby wall above a rack of scuffless Lebron 15s, is tuned to yet another broadcast. His laptop is reserved for Miami Heat games, which he is loath to miss; and his iPhone, retrofitted with a battery add-on that doubles its lifespan, rarely leaves his hands.



As the founder and primary custodian of House of Highlights—an immensely popular Instagram account featuring viral moments from both professional and everyday athletes—Omar is responsible for identifying the day’s most important dunks, threes, picks, jukes, blocks, snubs, sneers, cheers, fights, slights, and other miscellaneous oddities. Like sports itself, it is a blink-and-you-miss-it business. At the height of the NBA season, he works late into the night, identifying moments that strike him as impressive or charming or peculiar, then cutting them into clips and broadcasting them to the more than 10.8 million people who follow his page. Speed matters. If something noteworthy occurs right before a commercial break, he challenges himself to get it out before gameplay resumes two minutes later. The days are spent assessing the efficacy of the previous night’s work and combing through hundreds of videos submitted by fans—many of whom are professional athletes themselves.

He posts about 12 clips per day, tends to stay up until about 3 a.m., and has not taken a vacation in four-and-a-half years.





You could say Omar’s main competitor on Instagram is ESPN, even though its budget, staff, and overall infrastructure are light years ahead of House of Highlights’. The number that really matters is followers, and the Worldwide Leader in Sports has 316,000 more than Omar—a fact that it’s fair to assume is lost on exactly zero of the parties involved.

The Most Viewed Post in HoH History at 5.6m views.

Indeed, as House of Highlights ballooned from a dorm-room pipe dream to a sports entertainment party-crasher, the industry’s old guard has undergone a sort of augmented grieving process: denial, bewilderment, frustration, and, finally, brazen copycatting. Bleacher Report, a member of what might be considered its newish guard, came calling about an acquisition in 2015; it was finalized the following year for an undisclosed price.

Through his account, Omar has achieved the sort of translucent pseudo-fame only today’s social media environment is capable of bestowing. He has spent years behind the curtain, speaking to his fans through wry captions and friendly commentary. It has been a comfortable, lukewarm notoriety—perfect for a quiet son of Pakistani immigrants who still has yet to grasp how much he’s bent the sports media industry.



.



But the world has grown impatient with the mystery. Fans of the page flag him down at Knicks games and on the streets of New York. Professional athletes invite him to parties and give him pep talks about work and success. This fall, he’ll step in front of the camera to host a House of Highlights talk show, slated to be broadcast on Twitter.



It all points to a question that many of the account’s diehard followers have pondered for years, ever since a friend name checked Omar deep in the comments of one video. The inquiry has rippled outward, towards everyone concerned with sports, and how we consume them, and how quickly the relationship between those two things can shift, and what the sports entertainment industry will look like when they do.

Who is Omar?

.

Hayder and Ismat Raja, Omar’s parents, moved to Pembroke Pines, a suburb of Fort Lauderdale, in the late 1990s after emigrating to the United States from Pakistan. Omar’s fondest memories are of Sundays as a young boy: his mother working on dinner in the kitchen; his younger sister ricocheting through the living room, shrieking about god-knows-what; his father hurrying back from work to catch the Miami Dolphins game. Under his tutelage, Omar learned to obsess over sports—if not exactly play them.

“I just was never that good, never good enough,” he says. “If I wanted to get a consistent jumper, I would have to go in the lab and just practice by myself. I don’t like doing things by myself.” Over years playing pickup basketball, his greatest gift has always been vision—an ability to see openings a split second before anyone else, then sprint toward them for an easy opportunity.



.

In middle school, Omar and several of his friends were targets of racist bullying. “We all kind of got it, me and almost all of the brown kids I knew,” he says. “You didn’t even have to be Muslim. If you were Indian it happened.” Amid the abuse—being called a terrorist, being told to go back to Pakistan—his sense of humor sharpened. It became a tool for redirection, a sort of social eject button. "You want to be the guy that makes everyone laugh, so that people can overlook whatever joke they were going to say," he says.



These years also helped birth a competitive streak—an instinct friends sometimes stumbled across by accident. Waaris Zaheer, a classmate at the University of Central Florida, where Omar majored in business, remembers a flag football game the two were part of one winter afternoon. Omar was usually a competent receiver, but on this day, he couldn’t buy a catch.

.

“He was just coughing up every ball,” Zaheer recalls. “We ragged on him a lot about it, and he would get so mad.” Omar made excuses; he blamed the cold air, even though the South Florida weather had been balmy. From that point on, Zaheer says, “he would always try to set up football games, like, ‘I’m gonna prove you guys wrong the next time we play!’”

Throughout college, Sundays remained hallowed days of sports hyperconsumption. Omar, Zaheer, and a group of their friends often spent the better part of the day at Miller’s Ale House, a sports bar in Orlando, watching several games at a time. It was, in some ways, a precursor to the viewing experience House of Highlights cultivates today: A giant party of friends, swooping from screen to screen, peering at different games and reporting back to each other about big plays and outcomes.



“You just get used to looking at five different screens at once,” Omar says. “When it would reach like 3:50, and that first wave of games was coming to a close, there was so much going on. There were just so many people yelling about different things. That was the moment where you’re just trying to keep track of every single thing that was happening.”

.

Omar, a Muslim, never drank during these outings. He still has never tasted alcohol or smoked. Instead, he brought a laptop to do schoolwork.

In July 2014, the summer after Omar’s sophomore year, NBA superstar LeBron James surprised the sports world by announcing that he was headed back to the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team that had initially drafted him in 2003. For Miami Heat fans, the departure was the basketball equivalent of snapping the engine off a luxury jet at cruising altitude. It gutted Omar.

To cope, he created an Instagram account dedicated to Miami’s short-lived dynasty and installed a photo of Heat star Dwyane Wade as its avatar. Omar combed through years of footage, posting alley-oops and game winners. But he also began to obsess over the small moments—the stuff that all the major television networks seemed to miss: The spats and videobombs and pre-game handshakes. Gradually, the page broadened into highlights from other teams.

The audience came quickly, “like a snowball effect,” Omar says. “People were tagging their friends, who would tag other friends, who would tag other friends.” Remarkably, he was never asked to remove a video for copyright reasons.

One early success was a six-second clip of former Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving dunking on a wall-mounted Nerf hoop as two shirtless friends looked on. Years later, it reads like a blueprint for the account’s future: impressive yet goofy, polished yet relatable. The video made the rounds through sports blogs, with many linking back to House of Highlights. Before long, the page had reached half a million followers.



This all caught the attention of Doug Bernstein, then the vice president of social media at Bleacher Report. On July 1, 2015, he emailed Omar, asking if he’d like to chat in the near future.

“I'll keep it pretty simple,” Bernstein wrote. “We are looking to see if there are opportunities to work together.”

Omar wrote back two minutes later: “You available to talk now?”

Doug: “would you be free in 30 minutes?”

Omar: “Should be unless some crazy Free Agency news drops.”

When they got on the phone, such news did drop: The all-star power forward Kevin Love announced he would be joining LeBron James and Kyrie Irving in Cleveland; a new superteam was born. Omar excused himself to tend to his account.

.

Bernstein was caught off guard. “I remember thinking: Here is this kid that is being presented with this opportunity. Anybody else in his shoes would be like, ‘Oh I’m so excited to talk to you! I’ll put everything else on hold to have this conversation!’

Then another thought hit him. “I don’t really want that kid. I want the kid who’s going to hang up the phone.”



The negotiations lasted for several months. All the while, Omar continued with school. During his senior year, after Bleacher Report acquired the account in January 2016 and offered him a job, he pitched House of Highlights as a capstone project in “New Venture Design,” a business course. The syllabus promised that students would learn “how to evaluate entrepreneurial opportunities” and the art of “creating and adapting initial ideas based on customer feedback and research.”

Omar prepared to coast. “In my head, I was like, ‘This is going to be a joke, because I have the whole thing outlined already and no one really knows.’”

He got a B. The idea, his professor told him, was “just not realistic enough.”

.

One morning in late May, the House of Highlights team was huddled around a desk in Bleacher Report’s capacious Manhattan office. Omar was wearing a pink button-up, slim-cut jeans, and a pair of gray Kobe A.D.s. He is thin and considerably shorter than the athletes over which he obsesses, with dense black hair and a wide, toothy smile. It was the Friday before Memorial Day, and much of the company’s staff was on vacation. Others had been given the day off when a Bleacher Report executive lost a ping-pong match—and an accompanying bet—to an underling the day before. The result was an eerie silence, broken only by the team’s debate over whether the Houston Rockets could possibly upset the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals.



In conversation, Omar has a tendency to pump intrigue into otherwise simple declarative statements. He often tacks on a “this was interesting–” or a “what’s interesting about that is– ”, as though to prime you for inevitable fascination. It’s unclear if this tic is a function of awed surprise at his own good fortune, or a sort of semiconscious sales pitch, or both.

Around the office, he is referred to as “The Mayor of Bleacher Report” (or simply “The Mayor”) because he loves to wander—past the TV studio, Rihanna mural, and ping-pong tables—asking colleagues about their interests. More specifically, he likes to know how people found something they love: a song, a television show, a sneaker. How did it cut through everything else and demand their attention? He wants to see what they see.

This trait is useful. House of Highlights’ audience is predominantly people under 24, a demographic that’s notoriously difficult for conventional media to reach. When Bleacher Report bought out Omar, it wasn’t just paying for his sensibilities; it was inviting itself, like a keg-toting 29-year-old, into a party of Gen-Z sports fanatics. Today, the behaviors of these viewers–how many are watching and reacting, how many are still out there–is a point of obsessive scrutiny and dissection. During the NBA season, the page averages about 700,000,000 video views per month and a has a daily pickup of 10,000 new followers.



While House of Highlights has grown sharply, the old-guard in sports media has seen its fortunes fade in recent years. The behemoth, ESPN, has shed more than 10 million subscribers in the last seven years, conducted rounds of painful layoffs, and spooked investors. Fox Sports 1, which was introduced with great promise in 2013 as a challenger to ESPN, has struggled to gain traction.

ESPN still hauls in billions in revenue each year (thanks to cable TV subscriptions and the eye-popping rates it charges advertisers for live-sporting events) and employs thousands of people. Its streaming service, ESPN Plus, crested 1 million paying subscribers after just five months. In the other words, the network is catching up to digital realities. But it was slow to see what Omar did—that viewer's habits are changing, that young people have ditched cable and seek out sports highlights on social media and other platforms.

The result is nothing short of a sports broadcasting identity crisis.

“I have a 15-year-old son,” says Gus Ramsey, a former ESPN producer who’s now a program director at Full Sail University’s Dan Patrick School of Broadcasting. “There’s never a time when I say to him, ‘Hey, did you see – ?’, and his answer is ‘no.’ He’s seen everything.” For many young viewers, the surprise factor that shows like SportsCenter once used to keep audiences captive is gone. And the reason, Ramsey says, is simple: “Why am I going to sit around and wait to see this on TV when I can watch it on my phone right now?”

.

Because it’s owned by Turner Entertainment Company, Inc., Bleacher Report can grant House of Highlights nearly unbridled access to NBA games and all of their requisite moments. Even before it was acquired, the page benefited from league Commissioner Adam Silver’s laissez-faire attitude toward social media sharing, which he likens to “snack[ing]” on full games. Soon, House of Highlights will begin posting clips from Champions League Soccer, a sport whose biggest stars dwarf the NBA’s in both their international renown and their Instagram fanbases.

All that’s only half of the equation, though. The other half, the thing that Omar and his team do so well, is recognition—of trends, moments, opportunities. Consider the #DriveByDunkChallenge, a viral phenomenon that originated from one fan’s video. It worked like this: You cruise slowly through a neighborhood, looking for unattended basketball hoops. Once you’ve found one that is either regulation height or lower, you exit the car with your ball, dunk it, then escape with a bank robber’s urgency.



At first, fans started submitting videos of themselves pulling this off. Then the pros started to participate: New Orleans Pelicans all-star Anthony Davis, Boston Celtics small forward Jaylen Brown. Eventually, James Harden, 2018’s MVP, upped the ante: In his video, he parks a speedboat at a dock in Miami, barrels into a stranger’s pickup game for a decadent flush, then jogs away giggling. (Equally engrossing are the myriad fails: Would-be dunkers accidentally snapping decrepit hoops, slipping on puddles and being chased by pissed-off dogs.)

Then there was “Hoodie Melo,” a viral movement built around the 10-time all-star Carmelo Anthony. In May 2017, Omar spotted a video that Anthony’s trainer, Chris Brickley, had posted on his own Instagram account. In it, Anthony is working out indoors, looking particularly fit and determined, his hooded sweatshirt drenched in sweat. Omar re-posted the video, then several others, all of them featuring Anthony in the new costume. A mystique grew around the sweatshirt, which begat a nickname and alter ego: “Hoodie Melo.” Perhaps aware of the meme’s power, Anthony continued to overdress during workouts and high-profile pickup games. More buzz grew. Finally, as the Thunder tipped off their first game of the season, Nike’s Jordan brand debuted a “Hoodie Melo” sweatshirt. The entire inventory sold out in seven minutes.

Searching for the next meme-able moment, and sniffing out the potential to monetize it, consumes a significant portion of the House of Highlights team’s time. The day I visit in May, it spills over into lunch at Carmine’s, an Italian restaurant near the heart of Times Square.





As they wolf down chicken wings, the team, at the time composed of Omar and Doug Bernstein, as well as colleagues Drew Corrigan and Sam Gilbert, tosses around ideas about their forthcoming Twitter show, which seems very much in a “concept” phase. They consider asking NBA players to confront their biggest fears—spiders, say, or waterslides—on camera. Bernstein asks if anyone liked a recent idea he had about something called “phone call roulette.” They praise James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke for its simple production and Breaking Bad for its pacing.

“It’s all about the execution,” Omar says as a mountain of chicken parm arrives, “because none of it sounds good on paper.” His eyes flit from his food to his colleagues to his phone. The pile of direct messages is growing, which makes him visibly uneasy. Hundreds of teenagers are urgently trying to notify him they’ve dunked on a friend, or sunk a hole in one, or punctured the spleen of an opposing QB.

Bernstein suggests adding musical guests to the end of each show. Omar smiles, his eyes now glued to his phone.

“You must have one hell of a budget, dude,” he says.

.

How much of Omar’s success is due to some unique entrepreneurial skill, and how much is the result of perfect timing, a slightly above-average understanding of social media, and a dash of good luck?

To answer that question, it’s helpful to contrast House of Highlights with one of its most aggressive competitors on Instagram, Barstool Sports. Although Barstool’s account has roughly half as many followers as House of Highlights, its fanbase is rabidly loyal and its posts are often viewed by twice as many people. On Instagram, Barstool’s aesthetic is lewd and often cruel; it is concerned less with sports themselves than with drunk women and dick jokes and user-generated videos of people seriously injuring themselves.





To follow both accounts is to impose a sort of digital referendum on your own morality. On June 11, Omar and his team posted a video of a teenage pitcher striking out a batter to win a high school state championship. As the pitcher’s teammates run to the mound in celebration, he pushes past them to comfort the batter, who we’re told in the caption is a childhood friend. They embrace for several seconds before rejoining their respective squads. That same day, Barstool posted a video of another youth baseball game, shot from a nearly identical angle. In it, a young boy winds up for a swing and is beaned in the neck by an errant pitch. He collapses to the ground as the umpire, manic, waves his hands to stop play. Barstool’s caption: “Right in the larynx.”



Omar and his team look for videos that align with three ideological pillars: inclusivity, celebratory, relatability. They often post videos of athletes with disabilities and include affirmative captions–sometimes just “This is awesome”–next to them. On the rare occasion when their comments ecosystem turns toxic, they pull posts down.

“People go to Instagram as a way to talk to their friends,” Omar says. “So the way I view it is like, I’m just talking to my friends.”

To follow Barstool, on the other hand, is to rubberneck shamelessly. Over the summer, the account’s team posted a video of an overweight woman in a wheelchair being dragged by a motor scooter and thrown to the ground. It was quite popular. One commenter wrote, “That’s a lot of surface area to be road rashed.” Another wrote, “what's the matter thunder thighs, I thought you chubsters were a happy lot.”



.

Given the Internet’s natural inclination toward viciousness, it’s difficult to predict whose approach will ultimately yield better returns. But House of Highlights’ positivity has continued to attract followers at a rapid clip, including celebrities like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Justin Timberlake–as well as many of the same athletes that are featured on the account. When Kyrie Irving followed the page, Omar reached out in a direct message to thank him for doing so. Irving wrote right back:

“Appreciate you brother and your true eye for art through sports. You show respect and love and…thats all us athletes and fans want. Keep being you always. You always have my support.”

Although Omar is by all accounts low-key and low maintenance, he is stubborn about what should and should not appear on House of Highlights. And, on any given day, he is obsessive about responding to inquiries from his followers, famous and non. Deep in the comments of a post earlier this year, a user named dominicgeiss7 asked, “Omar, what’s your life story.”

He banged out a response—typo and all—within the hour. “Normal kid. Failed a couple classes in high school. Learned I needed to work my ass off to be successful. Gott lucky and started House of Highlights, worked hard, got fans that supported the page and now we’re almost at 9 million. Wild.”

One evening in late May, Omar saw into the future.

It was Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals–effectively this year’s ultimate NBA contest, given that LeBron James somehow managed to drag a handful of scarecrows through the Eastern division’s playoffs and past an injury-addled Celtics team. The Cavaliers were sure to get pummeled by either the Houston Rockets or the Golden State Warriors, who were unequivocally the NBA’s top two teams.

And here those teams were, neck and neck in Houston as the fourth quarter clock wound down. If the Rockets won, it would mean a 3-2 lead in the best of seven series. Unseating the Warriors, this decade’s (and perhaps this generation’s) most dominant team looked possible. The crown was in reach.

.

Omar was watching in his apartment. Suddenly, something felt different. “The fan in me came out,” he says. “I felt like I could’ve been witnessing history.” He thought ahead 10 years, to a time when he would tell the story of this game to his own children and their friends. He would need to get the details right. These were, after all, the sort of stories his father told him about Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino–moments to be passed down, moments from a time before everything was instantly clipped, catalogued, and commented upon.



Omar put down his phone and did something he rarely gets to do. He watched, free of obligation or distraction. He allowed himself two minutes of gameplay–enough time to enjoy Chris Paul’s cocky dissections of opposing big men; Stephen Curry’s mid-air acrobatics. It was Omar’s first such indulgence of the entire 2017-2018 NBA season. Enough time to see the Rockets eke out a close win before ultimately losing to the Warriors in seven games.

It didn’t last long. After the game ended, he backed up his recording, squinted his eyes, and started looking for moments to share.

LEBRON JAMES IS PRETTY HAPPY ABOUT NIKE’S STOCK MARKET SUCCESS

Despite the charred sneakers and gashed socks that resulted from the brand's Colin Kaepernick ad campaign, Nike shares hit an all-time high this week. And LeBron James, who, alongside Serena Williams and other athletes, appeared with Kaepernick in the commerical, took a little time to boast on Twitter.





Kaepernick’s taken more heat for speaking out politically than any athlete in a generation, but James also has a history of political action. Last month, President Trump attacked James’s intelligence via Twitter after the basketball player criticized his policies during a television interview. So while Nike’s success is definitely Kaepernick’s victory, James has definitely earned the right to gloat, too.

SORRY GUYS, BUT THE WOMEN ARE HAVING THE MOST EXCITING U.S. OPEN THIS YEAR

After eight days and five rounds of U.S. Open play, the storylines are coming into focus. If you’ve been staying up bleary-eyed until two in the morning to take it all in, then you already know: the women’s U.S. Open is incredible this year and we’d be fools to sleep on this moment.

To be fair, there’s been some cool shit on the men’s side.



Aussie battler John Millman took down normal human Roger Federer. Kei Nishikori and a sprightly Novak Djokovic are in prime form. We slogged through heavy-footed John Isner matches (congrats to us there). And on deck, best-competitor-in-sports Rafael Nadal and fan favorite Juan Martín Del Potro will meet for the 17th time, following up a five-set, four-hour-and-forty-eight-minute throwdown at Wimbledon.

The matches have been great, guys. But mostly, things have just been wet.

As for the women, the perennially under-appreciated tour is having a moment at the last slam of the season, and more people should take notice. (Might some cross-tours, ATP-WTA player championing help? I ask these things while scrolling Twitter every night and seeing moments like this.)

Serena is rolling. While charging to a Wimbledon final two months ago and now entering her ninth-consecutive (!) U.S. Open semifinal, she’s molded herself as an advocate for mothers on the stadium court she grew up on. It’s both stunning and completely unprecedented. Whether or not she wins her 24th major singles title doesn't matter—I have a feeling she will—because the record is now hers to set.

And amidst all the Serena "Don't Call It a Comeback" ads are Madison Keys and Naomi Osaka, two next-generation standouts who have quietly made their way through the draw.

Naomi Osaka: twenty years old, queen of the press conference (she jokingly told WTA reporter Courtney Nguyen that she had dreams of crushing her on-court) and the acceptance speech. She’s the first Japanese woman to make the U.S. Open semifinals in 22 years—but simply calling the multicultural phenom a Japanese athlete is reductive. (More on that here.) She won the “fifth slam” in Indian Wells this past March, and she’s only dropped 22 games in her first five matches in Flushing. Her round of 16 match against Aryna Sabalenka was among the best matches of the year thus far—it certainly had the most momentum swings.



More important than the numbers, though, is how Osaka makes tennis fun to watch again. She moves with unfettered confidence, serves a lot like Serena (her coach used to be Serena’s hitting partner), and her forehand? There are military-grade weapons less destructive. When talking about Osaka in a press conference today, her coach Sascha Bajin said she has a lot of similarities with Serena. He added, "[Serena] is more of a boss than Naomi is now." When she’s off the court, Osaka is an unabashed nerd who loves playing Overwatch on her computer. I'd say she's a boss already.

In the semifinal, Osaka might meet a very in-form Madison Keys. Unfortunately, one will lose. But it’s okay because this next-generation duel is one we’ll see again and again in the coming years. For her part, Keys makes the game look simple. She hits her forehand at around sixty- to seventy-percent full power, and she hits it harder than anyone in the women’s game. It's devastating. She deftly finished off her last match with a stunning open-stance inside-in forehand. If not Serena, I think Keys might lift the trophy—she was so close last year, and she seems more than ready now.

Like Osaka, Keys is a joy. Someone tennis needs. When you meet her, she's comes across just a genuinely decent person handling the inordinate amount of shit the pro tour throws at you. She’s ambitious, optimistic, steadfast (even when she’s injured) on-court, and spearheads determined anti-cyberbullying work on top of it all.

The ascent of these two feels inevitable as they continue making the game a simple yet multidimensional affair to cherish. And, perhaps more importantly, they’ll both continue to radiate empathy, which we could all use a bit more of these days.

So don't sleep on these last few days of the U.S. Open. Because where things go from here in the itinerant and erratic sport, who knows.

TRUMP'S ATTACK ON LEBRON IS JUST ANOTHER AUTHORITARIAN ATTEMPT AT SUPPRESSING ATHLETE-ACTIVISTS

When pardoning the late boxer Jack Johnson in May, President Donald Trump gave a statement about the circumstances of his 105-year-old conviction. It occured “during a period of tremendous racial tension in the United States,” said the President. “Johnson served 10 months in a federal prison for what many view as a racially-motivated injustice. He was treated very rough, very tough.” Earlier that day, during an interview with Fox News, Trump had backed the N.F.L.’s policies punishing players who refuse to stand for the anthem, saying that if you were unwilling to stand, “maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.”





It’s an irony that Trump and many of his supporters seem intent to overlook. They can acknowledge the bigotries faced by Jack Johnson and celebrate the activism of Muhammad Ali, all without recognizing the fact that their modern-day equivalents are the likes of Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James. Most recently, an interview James did with CNN’s Don Lemon attracted Trump’s ire, inspiring him to tweet a nakedly-racist attack on both men’s intelligence.

Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do. I like Mike! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 4, 2018

Trump, despite earning criticism from actors, musicians, and even the Pope, is particularly alert to any hint of rebuke from black sports figures. From Jemele Hill, to Steph Curry, and even LaVar Ball, Trump misses no opportunity to mock and demean black athletes. Though Trump’s feuds are unusually public and personal, he is not the first American to hate and fear the black athlete—only the latest and the loudest.

The President is right about one thing: Jack Johnson’s conviction was a racially-motivated injustice. Johnson was the first black heavyweight world champion, and enraged white audiences who subscribed to the the era’s long-held beliefs of white athletic dominance. The outrage was only compounded by his marriages, each to a white woman, in an era when the barest hint of miscegenation could trigger the lynchings of less prominent black men. His conviction for crossing state lines with a white woman in a supposed violation of the anti-prostitution Mann act was a clearly racist attempt to end his career. And the attempts to squash and silence noncompliant black stars have only continued in the intervening century.



Athlete activism crested with the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, with no one embodying the decade’s revolutionary spirit better than Muhammad Ali. When he died, elderly, withered by Parkinson’s, and the beneficiary of every medal and honor our nation bestows, it was easy to forget how truly hated Ali was for daring to choose his own name and religion, for speaking out against racism, and for refusing to fight in Vietnam. And we were eager to overlook the price he paid for his activism, when he was stripped of his title and banned from his sport for three years at the height of his career. When Ali died, Trump, like many who never supported his politics in life, was quick to praise him.

Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2016

Ali wasn’t alone in paying a personal price for his activism. During the 1968 Olympics, track and field stars Tommie Smith and John Carlos brought America’s national shame to the world stage by giving the black power salutes on the Olympic podium. (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, meanwhile, boycotted that summer’s games entirely.) Smith and Carlos’ silent protest led to their expulsion from the Olympics, an event that had, just 28 years before, been filled with swastika flags and Nazi salutes.





As Howard Bryant explains in his book, The Heritage: Black Athletes, a Divided America, and the Politics of Patriotism, athletic salaries exploded as the Civil Rights movement waned, ushering in a generation of less politically-inclined athletes with multimillion-dollar incomes to protect. There have always been plenty of sports stars willing to stick to stay silent off the field—for every Ali there was a Joe Louis, who not only joined the Army during World War II but recruited other African-Americans to the still-segregated U.S. armed forces. For every Bill Russell, who refused to stay silent as he endured years of racism in Boston while playing for the Celtics, there was an O.J. Simpson, who famously declared, “I’m not black—I’m O.J.” But in the ‘80s and ‘90s, political voices were few and far between, as stridently apolitical athletes dominated.

According to Bryant, Tiger Woods couldn’t even be persuaded to attend a Mets game celebration of the anniversary of Jackie Robinson’s breaking of baseball’s color lines—even after being invited by then-President Bill Clinton:

The president called Tiger Woods personally, and Woods told him the same thing. Thanks for the call, Mr. President, but I'm swamped. Tiger, Bill Clinton said, what commitments? I'm the president of the United States. Who do I have to call? I think I can get you out of them. Tiger held firm, giving President Clinton the stiff arm as well. The president offered to send an Air Force jet to deliver him to Shea Stadium. Instead, Woods was in Mexico partying with his friends on the beach.



Michael Jordan’s political activism, meanwhile, has long been summed up by the possibly-apocryphal quote that he didn’t wade into politics because “Republicans buy shoes, too.” When Trump says that he “likes Mike,” he means that he likes very rich black men, who, happy to earn fabulous profits for even richer white men, will use their truly mammoth platforms, their ability to puncture our increasingly impermeable political bubbles, to do little more than hock sneakers.

The tide changed again, however, in wake of the killing of Trayvon Martin, which sparked the recent wave of athlete activism. In the Trump era, this has coincided with an increased willingness on the part of brands and corporations—the companies behind lucrative sponsorship deals that athletes once feared imperilling—to enter the political fray themselves. While there are still high costs to activism, as Kaepernick can well attest, ours is now an era in which sufficiently successful and powerful sports figures can voice political views and keep their sneaker deals.

And no figure is a better match for Trump than LeBron James. Unlike Kaepernick, it would be impossible to accuse James of being an attention-starved star in decline—he’s made it to the NBA Finals for the last eight consecutive years. His impressive record as a humanitarian and family man leave little ground for personal attacks. And his latest charitable effort, a public school he opened in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, is James’ most impressive yet. The school is unique in that it provides to its low-income student population the stunning amenities usually available at only the best private and charter schools—an on-site food bank, job training for students’ parents, and guaranteed free tuition to the University of Akron for all graduates—while remaining a part of the public school system, adhering to state standards and not draining funds from the public education system.





It’s basically the opposite of the Trump administration’s vision for education, which would suffocate public schools in a deluge of vouchers and charters. Even the First Lady doesn’t seem to know whose side she’s on.

Trump is bitterly fighting the tide change since his ‘80s heyday, when black stars put their bodies to use for white entertainment and largely kept their mouths shut. Even his beloved Mike seemingly evolved, and updated his politics stance to suit. Today, Jordan responded to Trump’s tweet, saying that he “support[s] LJ,” and that he’s “doing an amazing job for his community.”

Meanwhile, LeBron James' priorities remain in order.

OLYMPIC SWIMMER RYAN LOCHTE BANNED FOR DOPING FOLLOWING SOCIAL MEDIA POST

Welp, it looks like Ryan Lochte has gotten himself into trouble again—this time, by posting a photo on social media that ended up getting him suspended for doping.

The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency announced Monday that the U.S. Olympic swimmer has been hit with a 14-month suspension after getting an IV infusion without a therapeutic use exemption, Sporting News reports. The agency launched an investigation after Lochte shared a photo of himself receiving said IV infusion on May 24.



Ryan Lochte could be in big trouble. IV ‘recovery’. pic.twitter.com/0Zm32lh5my — Fuck the Hypocrisy (@Digger_forum) May 25, 2018

The USADA's investigation found that Lochte "received an intravenous infusion of permitted substances at an infusion clinic in a volume greater than 100 mL in a 12-hour period without a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE)," according to Sporting News. In other words, even though the substance in the IV was permitted, Lochte didn't have special medical permission to be receiving as much of it as he did.

His 14-month suspension begins from the day he received the infusion—May 24—and will run until July 2019.

FRANCE WON THE WORLD CUP, AND PEOPLE ARE LOSING IT ON THE STREETS OF PARIS

After France scored its second World Cup win, besting Croatia 4-2 in Sunday's final, fans flocked to the streets in huge numbers to celebrate the national victory. Parisians swarmed the Eiffel Tower in a sea of blue, white, and red tens of thousands strong.

The similarly iconic Champs Élysées was also flooded.

French President Emmanuel Macron, watching the match from the stadium’s presidential box alongside host country leader Vladimir Putin and Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, seemed pleased with the win.

Putin attracted some attention of his own during the trophy ceremony. It took place during a downpour, and for long minutes Putin was the only world leader provided with an umbrella.

THIS WEEKEND, TRAVIS PASTRANA ATTEMPTS THE JUMP THAT NEARLY KILLED EVEL KNIEVEL

On Sunday, July 8th, legendary stunt man Travis Pastrana will attempt something that's never been accomplished before: Three record-breaking motorcycle jumps, back-to-back-to-back, in one evening. And the grand finale will be a shot at the jump that nearly killed Evel Knievel.

Chris Tedesco



Sunday night's Evel Live is Pastrana's tribute to Evel Knievel, the man who single-handedly invented the concept of the modern daredevil. But this won't be some low-energy retrospective of Evel's accomplishments. Pastrana will honor Knievel's memory with thrills, chills—and hopefully, no spills—in one action-packed night in Las Vegas. And you can watch it all, live, on the History Channel starting at 8pm Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8th.

Pastrana will attempt to recreate three of Evel's most legendary jumps, flying higher and further than the original stuntman ever did.

The Car Jump: In 1973, Evel Knievel jumped over 50 crushed cars at the LA Coliseum. On Sunday night, Pastrana will attempt to jump over 52 cars.

The Bus Jump: In 1975, Evel Knievel crashed spectacularly while attempting to jump his motorcycle over 13 city buses in London. Later that year—after retiring and then quickly un-retiring—Knievel successfully vaulted over 14 Greyhound buses at Kings Island amusement park in Ohio. On Sunday night, Pastrana will attempt to launch his motorcycle over 16 buses.

The Caesar's Palace Fountain Jump: This is the harrowing grand finale. In 1967, Evel Knievel attempted to jump over the fountain in front of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. He came up short, crashing at nearly 90 mph and breaking his left hip, right ankle, both hands and wrists, and crushing his pelvis. Knievel was hospitalized in a coma for nearly a month after this disastrous crash; he never attempted the fountain jump again.

On Sunday night, Travis Pastrana seeks to settle the score with the fountain.

Chris Tedesco



As if all of that wasn't challenging enough, Pastrana has added one more complication to the mix. Instead of using the type of lightweight, modern freestyle motocross dirt bike usually associated with extreme sports, Pastrana will be riding the Indian Scout FTR750 motorcycle you see here. Why? This is the closest modern equivalent to the style of motorcycle that Evel Knievel rode in the 1960s and 1970s: An American-made brute with a big, powerful V-twin engine.

Simply put, this bike was not built for jumping. It's heavy—375 lbs, nearly twice as weighty as the bikes Pastrana used for his world-record double-backflip motorcycle jump in 2006 and building-to-building single-backflip in 2009.

"The motor sits so far off to the left, you can’t stand straight up and down," Pastrana told Road & Track in the days leading up to the jump. "It wants to fall over to the left. This thing drops like a tank out of the sky. The bikes that Evel jumped, and this bike now, they’re not meant to fly."

Adding to the challenge, Pastrana will use the same bike for all three jumps. Normally, a daredevil only attempts one jump per event, so the bike can be tuned for one particular jump. On Sunday, Pastrana will attempt three drastically different jumps back-to-back, each requiring a different launch speed and time in the air. But if there's one person alive today who can exceed these odds, it's Travis Pastrana.

"It’s gonna be hot, there’s gonna be significant winds," Pastrana told Road & Track. A headwind will change the jump speed by 2-3 miles per hour. There’s gonna be a lot of calculations on the day. I don’t know if these jumps will work—I sure as heck hope they will. We’ve done our homework. But I haven’t jumped these jumps on that heavy of a bike. At the end of the day, it's about pushing the boundaries of the human spirit."

Chris Tedesco

If you want to watch daredevil history being made live and in real time, tune in to the History Channel on Sunday, July 8th, starting at 8pm. Road & Track's Deputy Editor Bob Sorokanich will be on TV discussing the physical, mechanical and psychological challenges that Travis Pastrana will face as he attempts to fly into the history books on his Indian motorcycle. Don't miss it.

JOEY CHESTNUT JUST BROKE THE WORLD RECORD AND WON HIS 11TH NATHAN'S HOT DOG EATING CONTEST

It was a hot and humid Fourth of July this year on Coney Island in New York when defending champion Joey "Jaws" Chestnut won his eleventh Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, but Chestnut perservered and broke the world record for hot dog eating, downing an astounding 74 dogs and buns in 10 minutes.

In the women's category, defending champion Miko Sudo emerged victorious, housing 38 1/2 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes.



This is Chestnut's job now. He makes his living as a professional celebrity in the world of competitive eating, telling ESPN's Kieran Darcy, "I never imagined it'd be my full-time gig. But now it is, the last seven years. I travel pretty much every weekend of the summer. And then during the winter, I still do appearances and a couple contests here and there. So I stay busy, and I basically get to travel around the world and eat."



"I still love it," Chestnut added. "It's addicting, beating the heck out of people and eating hot dogs and making people smile. I do feel like garbage afterwards, but so what? Most people feel like garbage after a long day of work."

Well, that's one way of looking at it. Congrats to the champs.

Update: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of hot dogs Chestnut ate, as the judges revised their initial count.

LEBRON JAMES WANTS TO STAY IN THE NBA LONG ENOUGH TO PLAY AGAINST HIS SON

LeBron James is one of the most accomplished basketball players the NBA has ever seen. And while he may be coming off a disappointing NBA Finals loss to the Golden State Warriors — and a next-level troll by Warriors player Draymond Green at the Warriors' victory parade — the basketball legend still has an achievement he wants to reach, even if he's almost 40 when he does it.



In an appearance on Uninterrupted, James opened up about what would be the greatest accomplishment of his career.

"If I'm on the same court as my son in the NBA," he said. "That would be number one in my lifetime as an NBA player."

Yeah, @KingJames has accomplished a lot, but his greatest lifetime achievement would be playing on the same court as his son. #MoreThanAnAthlete #StriveForGreatness 🚀 pic.twitter.com/gGbVEjPS4h — UNINTERRUPTED (@uninterrupted) June 12, 2018

According to Business Insider, this may just happen. James' 14-year old son, LeBron James Jr., is in the seventh grade, and has already received scholarship offers from colleges like Duke and Kentucky. But if the NBA were to go back to allowing players to enter the league straight from high school, LeBron Jr. would be eligible to enter the NBA in five years, which put him in the league at start of the 2023-24 season.

At that that time, James would be almost 39 years old, an age when many basketball stars consider retiring. NBA legends like Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, and Allen Iverson all retired at 39 or younger. That said, Jason Terry and Vince Carter are still going strong at 40 and 41, respectively.

James was one of the youngest players to enter the NBA when he started his career in 2003, and with his insane workout routine, he may still be in good enough shape to continue playing.



But would James want to play on the same team as his son? When asked, James coyly responded, "Or play against." It seems like he would rather go for the father-son fight of the lifetime, and NBA audiences would love to see it.

AN EXTREMELY OBJECTIVE GUIDE TO WHO TO ROOT FOR DURING THE WORLD CUP

We have entered the Sporting Dead Zone, as the NBA Finals passed with a sweet sigh of lopsided relief and all we are left with is the pleasant Sunday afternoon snooze that is regular season baseball. But wait! Just coming into view on the horizon is the World Cup, the quadrennial festival of The World's Game that sees the globe's very best in soccer talent compete for one of the greatest prizes in sports so that we don't have to settle in for the Orioles-Royals game.



The 2018 edition kicks off this Thursday, June 14, as host nation Russia faces off against Saudi Arabia in the battle of the oil-soaked champions of human rights. Now, those Russian time zones present an issue, as most games start before noon Eastern Time, sometimes as early as 6 a.m. And Real Cupheads know that this year will not feature the strongest field of teams in World Cup history: Italy, the Netherlands, Ghana, Chile, Cote d'Ivoire, and yes, the United States all failed to qualify. But just because the Stars and Stripes couldn't make it out of North America—the world's easiest region to qualify from by some distance—doesn't mean there's no reason to watch and no one to root for.

In fact, there are certain teams you should definitely root for, because science and facts. The favorites this year are the favorites every year: Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, and France. Ignore all of them, except France. And Argentina. OK, fine, just read on, and learn the objective truth about eight squads that deserve your allegiance over the next month.

Iceland

Getty Images

The tiny island nation's soccer outfit has been the subject of fawning profiles and a cult following for a couple of years now, and for good reason. They produced a sum-greater-than-the-parts performance at the European championships in 2016, thanks in no small part to the atmosphere created by their rabid traveling fanbase. That now-famous chant you heard at Minnesota Vikings games last season? They got that from Iceland, where it has been a Haka-style war dance since the real Vikings were pillaging.



In a notable achievement, Iceland knocked England out of Euro 2016, marking the second time that week those Brits left Europe after Brexit.

This will be Iceland's first World Cup in the nation's history, and you don't want to be on the wrong side of things from The Mountain for that. In terms of personnel, look out for Gylfi Sigurdsson, the classy central midfielder who has long plied his trade in England's Premier League. They kick off against mighty Argentina on Saturday at 9 a.m. Eastern.

Nigeria

Africa's largest economy also has the consensus-best jerseys in the tournament. They are hot fire. They have supplemented that with some dynamite airport style. They're on the way to their sixth appearance on the biggest stage, and they're the only of the traditional African powerhouses to qualify. They'll boast a team full of young attacking talent, including Alex Iwobi of Arsenal, Victor Moses of Chelsea, and the strikers Kelechi Iheanacho and Ahmed Musa. Add in the grizzled veteran Mikel John Obi in central midfield—who legally changed his name in a fascinating response to a clerical error by the Nigerian Football Association—and you've got a pretty formidable side.





Nigeria was thrown into Group D with Iceland and Argentina. They'll start off against Croatia, another solid squad rounding out one of the tournament's most exciting groups, at 3 p.m. Saturday.

Belgium

The hipster pick to win the tournament, this midsize Western European nation is currently enjoying a golden generation of soccer talent. Kevin De Bruyne was the runner-up for player of the season in the Barclays Premier League this past campaign, while Eden Hazard has been a world-class player—most of the time—for a number of years. The team is packed from back to front with bright young things, many of whom are the children of immigrants and who hail from both Belgium's Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities. Success will bridge political and cultural divides as the country comes together to cheer the national team. You know, like the U.S. team could've done.

They'll kick off against Panama, the America-slayer, at 11 a.m. Monday in one of the tournament's easiest groups.

Mexico

The relationship with our southern neighbors is not at an all-time high, but they are by far North America's most formidable representation now that the U.S. somehow lost out to Panama. Also, they have great away jerseys. The Mexicans boast an extraordinary record in World Cup play: they have made it to the round of 16 in the last five tournaments—something only Germany and Brazil can also claim to have achieved. Except those two have racked up three World Cup trophies between them in that period, while Mexico has crashed out in the Sweet Sixteen every single time.



This is a chance at redemption, and El Tri has the exciting young talent and inventive coach to do the business. Plus, you'll be able to tell which guy at the bar is against more than just "illegal immigration" when he gets mad at you for cheering them on. Mexico begins its run against the giants of Germany on Sunday at 11 a.m.

Portugal

Getty Images

The Iberians are the reigning champions of Europe, and they can thank one man for that. Cristiano Ronaldo is an attacking powerhouse, all rippling strength and explosive speed and deadly goalscoring. The winner of four of the last five Ballon d'Or trophies—for the world's greatest player—Ronaldo is two-footed and one of the most deadly headers of the ball the game has ever seen. He is a supremely gifted athlete and perhaps the hardest-working player in the game—a LeBron James-type generational talent. It is worth rooting for Portugal if only to see him cement his legacy as one of the greatest to ever step on a field. Plus, it's an event in itself when he tears his shirt off.





Portugal kicks off against Spain in one of the games of the tournament on Friday at 2 p.m.

Argentina

You can't have one without the other. While Argentina has a few more potent attacking options to call on than Portugal—Sergio Aguero and Paulo Dybala come to mind—there is only one player with whom the whole world knows this team lives and dies. If Ronaldo is LeBron, Lionel Messi is Wayne Gretzky: the natural, the chosen one.

A five-time world player of the year, Messi still looks like a kid on the playground as he tears apart the world's greatest defenses, game after game and year after year, with the kind of instinctive movement and skill that simply cannot be taught. His touch is magnetic. Once he gets hold of it, the ball seems to be attached to his foot on a string. He can see or feel everything moving around him, all at once, and where it will be next. He is one of the great all-time dribblers, and he simply never stops scoring goals—and creating them for teammates.

He is soccer's Great One, among the most decorated players ever, but he has never won a major tournament with Argentina. (Of the 29 cup finals he's reached with Barcelona, he has won 21 and scored 28 goals with 14 assists.) He dragged them to the final last time around at Brazil 2014, only to lose out to the eternally dominant Germans. He, too, has a chance at redemption and a legacy-making achievement. That's worth rooting for as Argentina starts things off against Iceland on Saturday.



Egypt

The North Africans head into the tournament with their talismanic star's participation in some doubt, after Mohamed Salah was hauled off with injury in the Champions League Final, the world's most prestigious cup competition, on Memorial Day Weekend. He was player of the year in the Barclay's Premier League last year, scoring 32 goals in 36 games and reaching the aforementioned final with Liverpool. He is a clinical goalscorer, a dangerous dribbler, and has electric pace on the counter attack. He's simply the kind of talent that no African team has been able to call on for some time, since at least the last match where Samuel Eto'o pulled on a jersey for Cameroon.

It appears that Salah will probably be fit to participate, but it's going down to the wire. With him, Egypt could be one of the most exciting teams in the tournament. Without him, they'll be forgettable. Let's bank on his taking the field when Egypt faces up to Uruguay at 8 a.m. Friday. No team's fortunes, except maybe Portugal, are more dependent on one man.

France

Getty Images

The French are shockingly talented, and up there with Brazil, Spain, and Germany among the clear favorites to win the big prize. But unlike the others, their World Cup history is a topsy-turvy tale of spectacular achievement and enigmatic Frenchness. This year, they can call on crazy talent going forward that includes Antoine Griezemann and Kylian Mbappe. Behind them, Paul Pogba is one of the world's premier central midfielders—all athletic dynamism and sublime skill. In an intriguing subplot, star striker Karim Benzema will miss out after being implicated in a teammate-sex-tape-blackmail scandal.

Like Belgium, France are an example of how the nationalist anti-immigrant fervor sweeping Europe at the moment seems to subside when the best damn players your country has to offer can just as likely trace their roots to North Africa as Bordeaux. They are a testament to the unifying power of sport, and will start their champions-or-bust campaign against Australia at 6 a.m. Saturday.

Well, there you have it—with a brief disclaimer: these are the teams you should root for, not bet on. Always bet on Germany.

INSIDE THE BLOODY RETURN OF BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING TO AMERICA

"I’m the boss I’m the boss I’m the boss,” says Bobby Gunn, the defending champion of bare-knuckle boxing, repeating a mantra from the film Raging Bull to himself just moments before taking the stage for the first legal, state-sanctioned gloveless fighting event in U.S. history. “Come on big fucker—let’s go.”





Walking out to Whitesnake’s “Here I Go Again” in front of a screaming sold-out crowd of 2,000 beer-drinking, cowboy-hat-wearing locals at the Cheyenne Ice and Events Center on the outskirts of Cheyenne, Wyoming, Gunn, 44, takes the stage, squaring off against his younger and larger opponent, Irineu Beato Costa, Jr., a. heavyweight boxer from Sau Paulo, Brazil. Standing just feet apart, Gunn and Costa raise their fists in a blood-stained steel circular ring built for this event, a striking image in U.S. sports history: no boxing gloves.

“Knuckle up!” one of the two referees yells.

Gunn, long used to fighting bare knuckle in underground illegal brawls with no time limits, is now forced to take a more aggressive approach in the event’s fast-paced two-minute rounds. Charging Costa, he throws a penetrating left hook to the liver, dropping him within seconds. After Costa manages a wobbly rise, Gunn then rushes him again, this time going for the kill—another deep shot to the liver topped by a final overhand right hook to the temple as he falls.

The crowd roars.

Costa lies crumpled on the ring.

The fight is over.

In only 41 seconds, Gunn has proven why he is the champion of this sport, demolishing his opponent with the precision of a surgeon, the victory and body shots so quick the internet will later wonder how he did it. But for Gunn, it’s just another victory to add to his lifetime 72-0 record in bare knuckle, only this time with a crucial twist—he won in a legal arena in front of a pay-per-view audience around the world. “I thought this would get legalized,” Gunn says, smiling, the cameras flashing. “Just not in my lifetime.”

“Come on big fucker—let’s go.”

After decades of fighting in underground illegal bare-knuckle brawls from alleyways to empty warehouses across the U.S., Gunn has finally achieved a victory he never expected—defending his title in the first legal, state-sanctioned bare-knuckle fight in U.S. history. On Saturday night in an ice and roller-skating arena adorned with advertisements for construction companies and giant American flags, Gunn and 19 other fighters from pro boxing, MMA, and street brawling entered the ring to resurrect one of America’s oldest sports. The ten-card event featured a mix of up-and-coming contenders like former UFC star Bec Rawlings along with aging pros like former UFC heavyweight Ricco Rodriguez, everyone fighting in five, two-minute rounds while wearing nothing on their hands but wrapping about an inch below the knuckles.

Legalized for the first time in U.S. history by the Wyoming State Board of Mixed Martial Arts in March, bare-knuckle fighting features rules similar to pro boxing—punching only, a standard eight-count, a three-knockdown rule—but with a crucial twist: no gloves allowed. The skin on skin contact makes for a bloody spectacle. But, also, according to rising research, it likely results in a surprising benefit—fewer concussions.

“In MMA, I can grab your head and ram it against my knee,” says promoter David Feldman, a former boxer who has worked for seven years to legalize bare knuckle, getting rejected by 28 states before Wyoming finally agreed to sanction it. “How is that legal and bare knuckle isn’t? With bare knuckle, there is a perception of it being a more dangerous sport—but it’s actually safer.”

Going into the bare-knuckle event on Saturday night, no one really knew what would happen—the sport had not made headlines in the U.S. in over 120 years. Once one of the most popular pastimes in the U.S., bare-knuckle boxing was practiced by immigrants competing in makeshift arenas in cities like New York and Boston in the 19th century, the sport’s greatest champion, John L. Sullivan, rising from his job as a plumber to become an international star, visiting the White House at the request of Theodore Roosevelt.

But even Sullivan’s greatest bare-knuckle match—a $20,000 bout near New Orleans in 1889—was illegal, the gloveless sport covered by press but never sanctioned by a state due to its perceived brutality. In 1892, when the U.S. legalized gloved boxing as a less bloody and seemingly more civilized form of combat—the gloves resulting in less precise hits and fewer cuts—bare knuckle disappeared from the spotlight entirely.

The sport, however, never really went away. Practiced for cash in underground illegal arenas from after-hours gyms to abandoned buildings, bare knuckle has recently grown into more mainstream popularity as a possibly safer alternative to boxing. Similar to the difference between rugby and NFL football, bare-knuckle fighters hit each other with less force to keep from breaking their hands—the self-governing aspect of the sport resulting in superficial skin-on-skin cuts but seemingly fewer concussions.

“We’ve done blunt-force trauma impact studies and concussion studies,” Feldman says. “This makes sense.”



Bobby Gunn Getty Images

In 2008, the comeback of bare knuckle began when Gunn fought for Feldman on a pro boxing match in Arizona. Introduced to the illegal sport by Gunn—a veteran underground bare-knuckle brawler in addition to being a pro boxer—Feldman saw business potential. In 2011, he featured Gunn in a bare-knuckle boxing event sanctioned by the Yavapai Tribe at the Fort McDowell Casino in Arizona, the event held on Native American land outside of the jurisdiction of state lawmakers.

The bare-knuckle fight was expected to draw around 50,000 viewers on livestream pay-per-view, making around $500,000. Instead, it attracted so many online requests they crashed the system, leaving Feldman and the victorious Gunn with no money but a glimpse of the sport’s potential. For the next seven years, they then tried to convince lawmakers to host another event until Wyoming finally agreed to take a chance—resurrecting the sport last Saturday night to a worldwide audience.

“This is less dangerous than both sports I already oversee,” says Bryan Pedersen, chairman of the Wyoming State Board of Mixed Martial Arts. “In Wyoming, we are driven by an independent western spirit — and I’m looking to bring money to my state by taking this mainstream.”

On Saturday, the premiere of professional bare-knuckle fighting was worth the wait. In addition to Gunn’s defense of his title, the night featured an array of fast-paced fights that kept the sold-out crowd screaming on their feet, propelling the event to become a worldwide trending topic on Twitter.



Sam Shewmaker, a 33-year-old stonemason wearing U.S. flag trunks and a Duck Dynasty beard from the Ozark hills of Missouri, dropped former Bellator champion Eric Prindle in just 18 seconds with a hard right to the chin. Bec Rawlings, a 29-year-old former UFC fighter originally from Tasmania, defeated boxer Alma Garcia in the only women’s bout of the night, grabbing her in a clinch and punching her face until the refs called a stoppage following the second round.

But the night’s greatest fight was perhaps its least expected—a middle-of-the-card matchup between veteran MMA fighters Joey “the Mexicutioner” Beltran and Tony “Kryptonite” Lopez. After a slow couple of initial rounds, Beltran and Lopez—whom had twice fought each other previously in MMA events—began a blood-spattered epic back-and-forth battle, trading punches and opening cuts until finally, when the bell rang at the end of the fifth round, both men were visibly exhausted, their faces and torsos dripping in blood and sweat, Beltran ultimately declared the winner by unanimous decision.

Smiling ringside, Feldman congratulated both fighters—this was exactly the type of bout needed to generate online buzz for the fledgling sport, one that happens to be launching on the 25th anniversary of the debut of the UFC.

“Other states are reaching out to me about hosting this as well,” Feldman said, looking out across the crowd. “This is the culmination of a decade of work and it’s just incredible to see fans loving it—we’re the new combat sport in town.”

At the end of the night, after his match, Gunn sat backstage, taking off his boxing shoes and smiling. For him, the event was more than just another victory—he had finally pushed his sport from the underground to the mainstream, opening the door for a new era of fighters. Embracing younger athletes like Beltran and Maurice Jackson, Gunn gave them tips on bare knuckle maneuvers while packing his bag, the elder statesman reflecting on his own journey to this groundbreaking night. “Finally, the world is watching what we do,” he said, heading for the door. “It feels good.”

SEASON FOUR OF CAVS VS. WARRIORS JUST GOT THE OPENING CREDITS SEQUENCE IT DESERVES

Last night, the Golden State Warriors defeated the Houston Rockets in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals, and so on Thursday, for the fourth year in a row, Stephen Curry and the Dubs will face LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals.

And because this matchup has proven to be Must-See TV three times already, the fine folks over at CBS Sports decided the fourth season of Cavs vs. Warriors deserved its own '90s sitcom opening credits sequence.



Vegas already has the Warriors as the heavy favorite, but the series is sure to be a fun one for basketball fans. Golden State took home the Larry O'Brien trophy in season one and season three of the now-iconic rivalry, winning in six and five games respectively—but LeBron James is playing the best basketball of his 15 seasons in the NBA.

Need more proof this one won't be so easy for the Dubs? Watch James, in Sunday night's Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, score while a grown man hangs off of his back and another fails to goaltend his layup.

Season four of Cavs vs. Warriors premieres Thursday night at 9 p.m. Eastern on ABC.

MAYBE WE DRAW THE LINE AT GUNS ON THE PITCHER'S MOUND

The NFL season may have wrapped up in February, but there's no offseason for national anthem controversies. A woman named Alishia Wolcott was scheduled to perform the "Star-Spangled Banner" at Greater Nevada Field prior to an upcoming minor league baseball game between the Reno Aces and Fresno Grizzlies. She's not anymore—because the stadium won't let Wolcott bring her gun inside.



"I WILL NOT sing our National Anthem at a place that seeks to strip me of my second amendment rights!!!" she wrote on Twitter. Accompanying Wolcott's tweet was a detailed explanation of her reasoning.

I WILL NOT sing our National Anthem at a place that seeks to strip me of my second amendment rights!!! @scrowder @NotGayJared @Courtneyscoffs @SvenComputer pic.twitter.com/ygfyQCvOrG — Alishia Wolcott (@alishiawolcott) April 11, 2018

Recently, Greater Nevada Field began using handheld metal detectors to help enforce its no firearms policy, which has been in place since the stadium opened in 2009. The use of metal detectors is a common practice at sporting venues around the nation, including at every Major League Baseball stadium.

"You have fallen prey to the absurd idea that American citizens need only trust their government for protection," she wrote. "This is indeed a lie and a blatant disregard for our constitutional rights."

Walcott went on to wonder how she was supposed to enter a baseball game without a firearm, calling the Aces "tyrannical."

"My husband and I took a long time to consider our options at Saturday's game: Do we simply place our 'protection' elsewhere and walk freely into the game—thereby giving up and giving in to this deterioration of our rights? Or do we walk away from something we both love, and take a stand against this tyrannical movement? As I am sure you are well aware—we walked away. We walked away angry and disappointed. Angry at the stripping away of self-protection. Disappointed because it happened at a venue that hosts one of America's favorite pastimes."



She concluded by writing that she considered voicing her disappointment while in front of the microphone prior to the game—calling this "a sort of Colin Kaepernick style"—but decided to abstain from participating altogether. "I have too much respect for the national anthem and the time dedicated for it...I just cannot be the one to perform it at this venue."

Walcott's protest is a bizarre twist on the the national anthem demonstrations that became popular in the NFL after then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand during the "Star-Spangled Banner" to protest police brutality before the 2016 season. Kaepernick has struggled to get a job since becoming an activist. He didn't play in 2017, and the Seattle Seahawks this week canceled a workout with Kaepernick after he refused to say whether he will stop kneeling during the national anthem.

Conservatives were appalled that NFL players would dare use something as sacred as the anthem to promote a political belief. That a conservative is now doing it—even citing "the Kaepernick style" as something she considered—is a little confusing, logically, to say the least.

AN AMERICAN BOXER GOT HIS ASS KICKED LAST NIGHT WHILE WEARING BORDER-WALL TRUNKS

President Trump has had such a tough time making progress with the construction of his long-promised border wall that the project is now starting to crumble, in a metaphorical sense. On Thursday night, Pennsylvania-born boxer Rod Salka showed up to his bout against Mexican super featherweight champ Francisco Vargas wearing red, white, and blue border wall-themed shorts. He got his ass kicked.

This isn't the first time Salka has had his ass handed to him by an Hispanic opponent. In 2014, Danny Garcia dropped him like a bag of dirt at the Barclays Center.

Though his loss Thursday night wasn't quite as vicious, he doesn't seem like he had much of a chance at any point during the fight. Vargas worked him over for four rounds before landing an uppercut in the fifth that forced Salka to his knees. The punishment continued in the sixth, and after the round concluded Salka's team threw in the towel, giving Vargas a TKO.

Salka's losing track record extends beyond the boxing ring. In 2016, he ran as a Republican for a seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, losing by more than 30 points to the Democratic incumbent.



“The military taught me a great deal about urgency," Salka said after announcing his candidacy. "You can’t just get around to things. They have to be done quickly and done well. That’s the kind of urgency I want to bring to Harrisburg, where the current crew can’t get a budget passed. It’s not enough to just show up. You have to do your job.”

The actual border wall hasn’t fared much better than Salka. In March, Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that didn’t provide any significant funding for his biggest campaign promise, frustrating many of his supporters who expected a swifter end to the “drug and people flows” coming from Mexico. With no wall on the horizon, Trump last week signed an executive order deploying the National Guard to the border, where he says they will stay until the wall is up. The governors of Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico complied by mobilizing troops this week.



As of Friday afternoon, Salka's Wikipedia page lists his boxing nickname as "The Racist."



Here's footage of the entire fight, in case you'd like to enjoy the metaphor in-full.

BRAD PITT HAD THE BEST TIME AT THE DODGERS GAME

There’s no better way to welcome spring than with baseball, and no one gets that better than Brad Pitt. The War Machine actor took in a Dodgers-A's game in L.A. on Tuesday night. (Pitt, of course, played the A's famous general manager Billy Beane in the 2011 film, Moneyball.) Just look at him, having the best damn time living his truth out there watching America's past time.

Pitt was crushing the dad style with a flat cap, goatee, and a long sleeve white t-shirt—a bold choice for a baseball game. The best parts of any ball game are the beer and hot dogs. But one misstep and you’re a mustard disaster, and then your onscreen team loses 0-4, and then you go home with no victories at all. That’s a gamble, y’all. But it seems like it was ultimately a victory, even with all the action. See, look at that excitement!

Getty Images

This year, Pitt is producing the Dick Cheney biopic, Backseat, starring Christian Bale and Amy Adams. Leave it to America’s cool guy to balance having fun at the ballpark with telling the complicated and turbulent story of one of this country’s most polarizing political figures. Go team!

THE PHOTOS FROM BASEBALL'S OPENING WEEK WILL DEPRESS YOU

A wintry mix fell on baseball stadiums across the country this week, which marked the beginning of the 2018 baseball season. Diamonds from Denver to Boston were covered in snow as players and fans steeled themselves for the chilly temps. "It's cold," Red Sox outfielder Mookie Betts said at Fenway Park, where Boston played its home opener on Thursday. "You keep trying to play mind tricks, but it's still 40 degrees. No matter how much you say 'mind over matter,' it still matters."

CONOR MCGREGOR'S VIOLENT RAMPAGE AT BARCLAYS CENTER WAS ALMOST TOO WILD TO BELIEVE

It's been a tumultuous 24 hours for Conor McGregor and the UFC.

On Friday morning, the controversial Irish fighter was charged with three counts of misdemeanor assault and one count of felony criminal mischief following a wild Thursday afternoon incident at Brooklyn's Barclays Center, which was hosting a media event for Saturday's UFC 223.



Backed by a 20-person entourage, McGregor, who was not scheduled to fight, snuck into the arena and appeared to hurl various pieces of metal utility equipment at a bus, injuring three fighters and forcing the UFC to reconfigure the card for UFC 223. McGregor is nicknamed Notorious for a reason.

Here's how it all went down. Strap in, because there's a lot to unpack here.

The drama began earlier this week when UFC president Dana White announced that the winner of Saturday's fight between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Max Holloway would be UFC's new lightweight champion. The belt had been held McGregor, who won it by defeating Eddie Alvarez at UFC 205 in November of 2016. McGregor has refused to defend his title, though, prompting White's decision to strip him of it. McGregor was not happy.

"You’s’ll strip me of nothing you’s do nothing c*nts," he tweeted Thursday morning.

That afternoon, McGregor showed up to Barclays with his entourage, sneaking into the venue with the help of someone who was credentialed to cover the event.

According to White, who said he communicated with McGregor following the incident, it wasn't McGregor's frustration at losing his title that led him to Barclays, but rather a beef with the Russian Nurmagomedov. Earlier in the week, another Russian fighter, Artem Lobov, a friend of McGregor's who was also scheduled to fight in UFC 223, got into a scuffle with Nurmagomedov at a hotel.



It's hard to tell exactly what is being said, but as the man holding the camera notes, "some Russian shit is going down."

It's unclear what exactly McGregor and his crew set out to accomplish by storming into Barclays, but it didn't end well. On Thursday afternoon, a video surfaced of a man who appears to be McGregor grabbing a metal barricade in an underground parking area and hurling it at a bus containing several fighters, including Nurmagomedov.

TMZ obtained an additional video of a man they identify as McGregor jogging across the same parking area, grabbing a dolly, and throwing it at the bus, breaking one of its windows.

When the dust settled, three fighters were injured (but not Nurmagomedov, who told MMA Fighting, "I am laughing."), and McGregor was, well, at first no one seemed to know.

McGregor would later turn himself into authorities, who held him overnight. On Friday morning, he was charged with three counts of assault and one count of criminal mischief. Cian Cowley, a member of McGregor's entourage, was charged with one count of assault and one count of criminal mischief. UFC 223 will still take place, but three fights have been canceled, two because of injuries resulting from McGregor's antics, and one because it involved Lobov, who was part of McGregor's entourage.

McGregor was released from custody Friday on $50,000 bail. His next court date is set for June 14.

Max Holloway, who was scheduled to fight Nurmagomedov, was among the injured, but it appears that the UFC will replace him with another opponent.

On Friday morning, McGregor was led out of Brooklyn's 78th precinct in handcuffs.



Dana White has done plenty of press since the incident took place. On Friday morning, he told ESPN that he would not be helping McGregor wriggle his way out of trouble.

"Normally, yes, I would dive right in and do everything in my power to help one of my guys," he said. "But not in this situation. He came into the Barclays Center, attacked our fighters and attacked my staff with a bunch of guys. No, you don't get my help on this one."

As for whether White will fire McGregor from UFC, which would seem to be a rational response to an employee going on a violent rampage attacking his co-workers, White was noncommittal. "Obviously, the big question everybody's been asking me is, 'Are you firing Conor McGregor?'" White said. "This is bigger than Conor McGregor getting fired. There are so many more moving pieces to this thing."



White is a fight promoter and a showman, and as bad as it was, the incident on Thursday resulted in a bounty of publicity for the UFC, which hasn't generated many headlines as of late. Though White vehemently denied the fracas was orchestrated, telling ESPN it's "the last stunt on Earth we would ever pull," it's not unreasonable to wonder if the wheels may have been greased. The story is almost too ridiculous to believe (McGregor just happened to be in New York this week?), and the UFC stands to cash in big if the fallout is managed properly.

It's still pretty implausible that any facet of this was premeditated, but the potential storyline of McGregor returning from his hiatus—and possible jail time?—to fight Nurmagomedov in an effort to win back his lightweight title sounds like a plot devised in a WWE writers' room. Such a bout would also bring in untold sums of Pay-per-view money, and as anyone who follows professional fighting knows, never bet against the money. In other words, we have a feeling McGregor hasn't stepped into his last octagon.

WHO WILL WIN THE 2018 MASTERS? TIGER WOODS, DUSTIN JOHNSON, JORDAN SPEITH ALL FAVORITES

The run-up to this year's Masters tournament was all about one golfer: Tiger Woods. It's been a tumultuous 10 years for one of the most dominant athletes of our lifetime, but after a lengthy, injury-induced hiatus, Tiger has returned to the game with a vengeance. He's registered two top-five finishes in his last three starts, his swing looks better than it has in years, and he's charming the media along the way.



This time, it really does feel like Tiger is back.

His return, and all its hype, presents an interesting opportunity for his opponents. While the media, and the crowds, are closely following his progress—he shot a one-over 73 on day one—players like Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy have the opportunity to calm down and play their game. That's the only way to win a green jacket, and after day one at the Masters they're both in position to do so. But it's only Friday.

Spieth demonstrated his chill masterfully on Thursday. A rocky start and 73 finish for Woods cleared the way for Spieth, whose five straight birdies on the back nine resulted in a six-under 66. With all eyes on Tiger, the 24-year-old phenom casually finished the first day as leader in the clubhouse.

Woods finished with a +1 73 in Thursday’s round, seven strokes behind leader Jordan Spieth. Getty Images

Although Tiger's not the top-ranked player in the world (that would be long-ball bad boy Dustin Johnson), Augusta National is Tiger's playground. He knows the course more intimately than any other golfer on tour. Leading up to Thursday, he’s looked confident, comfortable, and poised to bring home his fifth green jacket. During Thursday's round, Woods grimaced in frustration as his tee shots found fairway bunkers and pine straw, but he was able to bounce back and pick up two shots by day's end.

The Tiger Factor is still a factor. Not all is lost. But it's only Friday.

Traditionally, the Tiger Factor—or the knowledge that Tiger is on the course, not far off the lead, and could surge at any moment—is a detriment to other golfers. There's nothing more nerve-wracking than being in the top five on Sunday with Woods hot on your trail. If you let the attention get to you and drop a few strokes, Tiger will pounce.



For the not-so-well-known names who are lucky enough to survive through to the weekend (there is always someone that makes you say, "Who?"), this pressure can be debilitating, especially on a course as unforgiving as Augusta National.

Jordan Spieth, the fourth ranked golfer in the world, dominated Augusta on day one with five straight birdies on the back nine. He’s seven strokes ahead of Tiger Woods going into Friday. Getty Images

But for the world's top ranked golfers, the unprecedented hype surrounding Tiger's return may provide an opportunity for a relatively peaceful few days on the golf course. While Woods was absent, superstars like Johnson, Spieth, Justin Thomas, and Rickie Fowler rose up the ranks, and with their success came the brunt of the media's attention. With the spotlight now on Woods, the young guns have a chance to strike early and climb up the leaderboard unfettered. Spieth started to on Thursday. But it's only Friday.

The names atop the leaderboard have only one day left of chill in them. If Tiger goes low tomorrow, they'd better do the same. Yes, it's only Friday, but if Tiger Woods goes into the weekend in position to strike, the Tiger Factor will take over.

PRINGLES NEW THANKSGIVING DINNER FLAVORS OF TURKEY, STUFFING, AND PUMPKIN PIE REVIEWED

My skepticism rarely outweighs my curiosity. That's why, on a recent weekday afternoon, I found myself eating Pringles naturally flavored to taste like Turkey.

It was the first can I opened of the three new Thanksgiving Dinner flavored crisps that arrived at my desk that day. The others being Stuffing and Pumpkin Pie. That was a couple weeks ago, and before we get to my thoughts on them, I'll tell you: Pringles already sold out of these bad boys in a mere 41 minutes. Don't worry, it's not the end of the road, friendo. We'll discuss that later.



Getty Images NurPhoto

I started with Turkey purely out of intrigue—how could the distinct flavor of this seasonal bird be injected into a Pringle? They did it, and they did it well! Plain turkey in its original form actually tastes kind of gross, in my humble opinion. But Pringles added just enough herb to these without completely drowning out the faint poultry taste.



I went to Pumpkin Pie next, so that I could get it over with. I'm not a big fan, and I think it's time we all admit it's kind of useless. Give me some pumpkin cheesecake instead. But wait! Have we found the perfect vessel for its flavor? I think yes. The little bit of salt added to this seasonally overused flavor adds a unique twist, and I far prefer the crunch of a Pringle to the mushy mess of a IRL pumpkin pie.

I saved what I thought would be the best for last. I was, again, correct. Pringles' Stuffing flavor should be available year-round, because it is not only fantastically accurate but also as a pat on their own back for this accomplishment. The garlic, the corn, the onion, the black pepper, the celery—it's all there. But that's not it! The subtle transition from potato flavor to the flavor of, well, bread, is what amazed me most.

We've discussed a few different dish-inspired potato chip flavors here. And Pringles' ability to recreate stuffing is the most impressive of any chipmaker. Here's an idea: smash a bunch of these up and use them as a crunchy topper for your actual stuffing this year. Seriously.

So, as I mentioned before, these took less than an hour to sell out when they (briefly) dropped on November 6. And so Pringles is going to do a really cool thing and auction off a pack on eBay on November 27, a holiday called Giving Tuesday that I did not know existed.

The proceeds of the auction are set to benefit No Kid Hungry, an organization that aims to feed kids in America whose families don't have the ability to do so on their own. If you like helping people while also helping yourself (to some delicious Pringles), I suggest you keep an eye on the Pringles Facebook page over the next couple of weeks.

GAME OF THRONES JUST RELEASED 8 SCOTCH WHISKIES, AND THERE GOES OUR WINTER

Winter is coming, but ever so damn slowly. HBO finally gave fans a premiere month for the new and final season of Game of Thrones—April—which leaves us with five months to twiddle our thumbs and wait. How better to pass the time than by drinking?

Game of Thrones just released eight—yes eight, conveniently one for each season—bottles of single malt scotch whisky. Each scotch comes from a lauded Scottish distillery, and each is paired with one of the Houses of Westeros or the Night's Watch. For example, Cardhu Distillery was founded in 1824 by Helen Cumming and her husband John. Legend has it Helen would disguise the distillery as a bakery when taxmen came around to avoid paying alcohol taxes, and smuggle bladders of whisky under her skirts because she knew that she, a lady, wouldn't be searched. For this collection, Cardhu's Gold Reserve is bottled with House Targaryen's dragon crest, where another strong woman makes the calls.



Houses Tully, Stark, Lannister, Greyjoy, Baratheon, and Tyrell are also included, as is the Night's Watch with its own black bottle. The bottles are available now, and run from $30 past $100. If un-dead antagonist is more your style, Johnnie Walker just came out with a White Walker (duh) whisky. There's plenty of GOT booze to go around this winter while you're re-bingeing the first seven seasons.

TRUMP'S TRADE WARS ARE MAKING US EAT LESS CHICKEN AND MORE BACON

Donald Trump's presidency is clogging American arteries.

When the President decided the U.S. was getting a very bad deal from trade agreements with Mexico, China, and other worldly powers, he enacted a tariff on steel and aluminum that he said favored U.S. manufacturers. But that tariff back-splashed all over other American companies, with Harley-Davidson, Miller-Coors, and more saying they would be forced to move jobs overseas. Mexico and China also retaliated with their own taxes, including on U.S. pork.





Now, less pork is going abroad, leaving more on the home front, where prices are being cut to accommodate the excess supply. And instead of letting all that meat languish in supermarket freezers and fast food fryers, we're ditching chicken to eat more and more bacon, pork chops, and beef. The Trump administration is really doing a number on our health.

Reuters reports that per capita consumption of pork will rise 4.3 percent, beef will rise 2.6 percent, and chicken will only rise 1.2 percent in the next year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Experts say the chicken industry won't be profitable this quarter after 27 straight quarters of growth. Given the choice of red meat (despite that "the other white meat" slogan, pork is red) and chicken with price no longer a factor, Americans are choosing red meat. Obviously, because we have taste buds.

Fast food chains are even debuting more hamburgers than usual, according to one analysis.

"The shift from chicken to beef and pork has been far more pronounced than anyone had imagined," a managing director at an investment firm told Reuters.

If those good deals we did with Mexico and Canada after the tariff war started are implemented, experts say the U.S. would get to export more pork and reverse this anti-chicken trend. In the meantime, go enjoy a Wendy's S'Awesome burger, which comes topped with three bacon strips and American cheese, on the president. And don't expect the nation's healthcare system to adequately support your failing cardiovascular system.

HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN SALSA WITH MEXICAN CHILES

The first thing you should know about making your own fresh salsa is that it’s easy. Really easy. Like, mash up some tomatoes, peppers, and garlic and stuff your face easy. And with salsa, fresh is always best—especially when there is plenty of spice to go around.

Fernando Dávila gets it. In 1960, his grandfather Cecilio opened La Flor de Jamaica, a dried goods store on the edge of Mexico City’s legendary Mercado Jamaica. Today, it’s a pilgrimage for true capsaicin heads, where Dávila carries on the family legacy to evangelize on behalf of Mexican chiles.

“Mexico is the country with the greatest diversity of chile peppers in the world,” he says. “It is well known that in today's society, the only way to preserve these ingredients is to consume them.”

In other words, if the demand disappears, so will the peppers.

While part of Dávila’s mission is to educate anyone willing to learn on the proud history of his country’s chile stash—65 varieties!—he also wants to emphasize how damn fun they can be to work with, and of course, eat.

“I consider necessary for spicy lovers, who are not few, to be aware of the great variety of flavors and forms that chiles can offer us,” he says. “I invite them to take an active role, and with the help of a molcajete or a blender if you don’t have one, discover how easy and satisfying it is to make your own fresh spicy sauces.”

So try experimenting with mixing and matching different dried chiles. Whether you like things hot, mild, or somewhere in between, there’s never a bad time to perfect your signature salsa blend. Just make sure you have some quality chips (and maybe a glass of milk) at the ready. As demonstrated by Dávila, here's where to start.

ALL-DRESSED POTATO CHIPS ARE THE BEST FLAVOR OF POTATO CHIPS IN EXISTENCE

Late last year, for reasons unknown to me, Ruffles invited journalists to an event to try chip flavors paired with various beers. This was a no-brainer "yes" for me.

The event was held just before Esquire introduced Drunk on Chips, and I won't object to the idea that it was the a-ha moment that catalyzed our little weekly* column here. I discovered three things while I was there. First, I could talk a lot of bullshit about potato chips to anyone who'd listen. Second, they were putting Flamin' Hot dust on regular Ruffles now. Third, and most important, the taste of All-Dressed flavored chips.

Get Yourself Some Now



All-Dressed chips are staples of the Canadian chip aisle. They weren't sold in the U.S. until 2015, when our friends at Frito-Lay introduced the Ruffles version of All-Dressed. The flavor is a brilliant cocktail of barbecue, salt and vinegar, and ketchup. I will admit, the last flavor on its own is quite unfortunate. If All-Dressed were the 2018 Cleveland Cavs, Ketchup would undoubtedly be its J.R. Smith: you can't give it the ball and expect clutch play.



With All-Dressed, you get the best of every world. The vinegar shines, but doesn't tear you apart the way it does when dancing with salt only. The barbecue is vibrant, but not so powerful that you can't taste potato. The ketchup adds a hint of necessary sweetness to the mix. Altogether, the flavor of these chips is as exciting and complex as any flavor on the market.

Throughout the past half-decade, at least, chip brands have invented wild and complex flavors, many of them inspired by actual meals: BBQ Ribs, Buffalo Ranch Wings, Lay's Cheesy Garlic Bread. Many of the complex flavors you hear Top Chef judges wax poetic about are now available in chip form to enjoy on the living room couch where you're watching the show. We've talked about many of these flavors here—Lay's even has an annual rollout tied to this tactic, and they do it quite well.

Ridgies

But I can confidently say that All-Dressed chips are the best flavor of chips you could hope to come across, because they accomplish simplicity and complexity in the same bite. Where a Lobster Roll flavored chip might make you think too much, and a Lightly Salted chip not enough, All-Dressed are like training wheels for the budding food critic. Just three—four, if you count potato, which you should—flavors to contemplate. There's a little garlic, a little onion, maybe some pepper in there for those with more advanced palates to acknowledge, but the MVPs all make themselves apparent. And they're all good. It won't tear your mouth apart, it might leave you with some interesting breath, and it definitely will leave you wanting another bag—if not for yourself, at least to tell someone else about.

In the months following my discovery at the Ruffles event, I started hearing more and more about All-Dressed. At a wedding, my cousin Annie said she had a recco for me; my friend Mia, a week later, said the same thing. They were both talking about All-Dressed, and they both got me bags they wanted me to try.



Mia was in Toronto, and brought home an All-Dressed from a brand I'd never seen before, Ridgies. The ripples are tight, and the chips are dense and consistently medium-sized. Annie's husband Sean, who is Canadian, mailed me a bag of Ruffles's version. They're everything you know and love about Ruffles, but equipped with the best flavor around. I wish every brand had an All-Dressed offering. Imagining Cape Cod's perfect crunch coupled with the complexity of All-Dressed seasoning makes my mouth water. The thought of stacking at least five All-Dressed Pringles and shoving them into my mouth, ever-so inelegantly, is the most tantalizing thought I've had in years.

Alas, I've tasted only two brands of All-Dressed—Ridgies and Ruffles—so please recommend (or send me) more. Thanks to the Internet, I can buy all the Ruffles I want, but I dream of a day when I can walk into a bodega and see All-Dressed on the shelf.



It's not just the universal legalization of recreational marijuana and Justin Trudeau's handsome face that America's hat has done right. Chalk up another win for our neighbors to the north—they've brought us the best chip flavor a U.S. Dollar can buy.

Some Pairings

How about some poutine: Why not keep the theme going and tip your cap to our neighbors in the north. This is what happens when you're aggressively kind and progressive. You come up with great ideas like All-Dressed. America should try it for a change.



Another person: You have to share these with someone who's never had them. I'm grateful for the Ruffles plug for introducing me, and for Mia and Annie for their tips. Everyone needs to know about All-Dressed.



Honestly, nothing at all: These chips can fend for themselves. They're worthy of your full attention, should you be without a pairing.

THE COEN BROTHERS' 'THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS' HAS REINVENTED THE WESTERN

It’s hard not to watch The Ballad of Buster Scruggs from writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen without thinking how it would have played in its originally intended format of six-part Netflix mini-series. The skeletal remains are in evidence: the film is divided into six tales of characters making their way, by hook or by crook (mostly crook), through the vast American Midwest in the 1800s.



Netflix

Here’s Buster in the opening story, played by Coens stalwart Tim Blake Nelson, strumming his guitar on horseback and singing a cowboy ditty with back-up provided by the echoes off the rocks in Monument Valley. But Buster is not so much singing cowboy as a cheerfully psychopathic gunslinger (did we mention this is a Coen brothers film?) and his 15-minute story ends in a series of exuberantly violent showdowns.

Netflix

Next up is James Franco, in an equally enjoyable but slight tale of a would-be bank robber who gets more than his fair share of Wild West justice. We also get Tom Waits as a grizzled gold-digger with his eye on the prize, and Liam Neeson as a travelling showman whose act, for now, is the stirring oration of a limbless boy. But just when you start to wonder where it’s all going, the Coens deliver a beautifully crafted and devastating story (did we mention this is a Coen brothers film?) about a young woman (Zoe Kazan) trying to plot her future on the Oregon Trail, followed by a fiendishly Poe-etic coda about bounty hunters, played by Brendan Gleeson and Jonjo O’Neill.



Netflix

Would The Ballad of Buster Scruggs have worked as a series? Notwithstanding the lengths of the stories vary, they don’t all have the structured pay-offs that might make them satisfying stand-alones. Taken together the cumulative effect of the adventures of Buster and company — the bleakness, the black humour, the grubby, amoral pragmatism — makes for an unconventional and stealthily affecting whole.

WHAT WE'RE EATING THIS WEEK: BEEF DAUBE, CROQUE MONSIEURS & WINTERY SPANISH STEWS

1 | Daube Of Beef @ Le Petit Citron*



An old-fashioned idea, perhaps, and not one readymade for our age of Instagrammable sharing plates and stripped back design aesthetics, but everyone should have a brilliant local French bistro, cooking Gallic classics at decent prices, and these days hardly anyone does. So a warm bienvenue to Le Petit Citron, a superb example of the genre, in Brook Green, West London, steak-sandwiched between Shepherds Bush and Hammersmith, offering clever, cultivated takes on traditional, Provençal-inflected dishes, as well as exceptional service in convivial surroundings. Stand-out orders: Coquilles Saint-Jacques to start and a sensational slow-cooked daube of beef, washed down with a bottle of house red.

2 | Croque Monsieurs @ Brasserie of Light

Brasserie of Light

You’d be forgiven for thinking that Peg, as he is affectionately becoming known, is just a bit of Christmas bling. But nope: the sparkling Swarovski crystals encrusted on this 24ft Pegasus will not be fading come new year – they form a Damien Hirst creation that protrudes majestically out of the wall in Selfridge’s & Co’s new permanent restaurant, which opened yesterday. Brasserie of Light can be accessed from its own entrance or, during retail hours, via the menswear department, and is run by Caprice Holdings, who are also responsible for Sexy Fish, Balthazar, Scott’s, and the Ivy collection.

Atmospheric mirroring adds to the art deco vibe in the bar, whilst the restaurant is lit by both the vast windows and, of course, Peg’s glistening 30ft wingspan up above. Open from breakfast through until dinner, start with Jenga-style croque monsieurs and healthy juices in the morning, and lead up to punchy G&Ts and lobster spaghettini later on. Prices do not, thankfully, match the mythical beast’s closely guarded (but definitely hefty) value.

3 | Martinis & Courgette Fries @ Anthracite

Anthracite



Anthracite is a bar for when you really, really need a stiff drink. As the name would suggest, the interiors are sultry and darkened, with blue velvet banquets waiting in each of the three small and interconnected rooms for you to sink into. The menu is a Martini-lover’s paradise, kicking off with excellent (yet succinct) lists of gins, vodkas and vermouths for you to pick from. There is also a selection of classic cocktails should such specific decision-making skills elude you, and a robust selection of other drinks for you to peruse (whiskies and wines are particularly comprehensive). Food, similarly, is satisfying yet no-nonsense: cheese and charcuterie to line your stomach, and a small range of hot nibbles. If it’s been a truly awful day, line up a Vesper with some courgette fries, which come crispy, steaming hot, and enriched by truffle oil and parmesan.

4 | Oxtail, Mashed Potato, Pied Bleu & Egg Yolk @ El Asador, Sabor

Sabor

It’s bloody freezing all of a sudden, hence your natural inclination towards hearty and heartening dishes that are rich and warming and gratifying rather than needlessly virtuous. But that doesn’t mean you should stint on quality, so head to Sabor, hidden just off Regent Street. It got its first Michelin star last month and is diving into winter the Spanish way, with rich bean stews and slow-cooked meats served with proper, crusty, bread that sends you into an endless but glorious cycle of dipping to mop up the gravy, then adding gravy to use up the bread, then needing more gravy for the leftover bread, and on and on it goes. But how else to while away a rainy day when the shoppers outside are going mad with this Black Friday nonsense? Order the oxtail with mashed potato, mushrooms and egg yolk – a mesmerising bowl of silkiness slowly swirling around before your eyes – and you will forget you were ever out there shivering and/or swearing at the slow walkers.

5 | Chops & Cocktails @ Blacklock Shoreditch

Blacklock Shoreditch

And if a good steak is all you’re really after then you can rejoice in the news that Blacklock have opened up in Shoreditch, with their biggest site yet. The original Soho chop restaurant oozes with atmosphere in its tiny, shadowy basement and although slightly bigger, the City one follows the same format; Shoreditch is on the ground floor with many more tables but, never fear, it hasn’t lost its charm. As ever, the cuts of meat won’t disappoint, coming from the incomparable Philip Warren & Son in Cornwall, so get there on the earlier side if you want the full pick of the bunch. Otherwise, you’re always safe (and satiated) with the ‘all in’, which gets you a mound of the boneless chops on top of charred flatbread; order ash-roasted sweet potato and barbecued lettuce with anchovy on the side, and one of the cocktails, many of which come courtesy of the fabulous Slowly Shirley speakeasy in New York.

6 | BOOK: Lanson Gourmet Dining Experience @ The English Grill

The English Grill



Ok, so Christmas is kind of nearby. But it’s still November, people! So a special supper club evening that doesn’t feature pigs in blankets or mince pie-flavoured ice creams and, instead, offers a restrained, traditional dose of class, is very welcome. The English Grill at The Rubens at The Palace hotel in Victoria has teamed up with royal Champagne suppliers, Lanson for a four-course dinner paired with different expressions of the fizz. You start off with king scallops, chorizo and smoked Applewood, moving onto chicken with bubble and squeak and truffle pesto, and more. They’ll treat you like the nobility which resides so close by, and send you on your way with a massive smile on your face. Don’t get us wrong, we’re all for bauble-shaped sausage rolls and glittery smoked salmon, but it’s all just a little premature, n’est-ce pas?

29 November, tickets cost £70 per person

THE VULNERABILITY INDUSTRY: HOW MALE MENTAL HEALTH BECAME BIG BUSINESS

The hashtag #doyouevenmentalhealthbro? recently started to appear on social media. A play on the meme “Do You Even Lift, Bro?”, the condescending expression used on fitness forums to question the legitimacy of someone’s routine — “lift”, as in lift weights — it was designed to… what, exactly? Highlight that men need to pay more attention to their mental wellbeing? Chide them for not doing so? Make them think?



Or was it instead emblematic of the next trend in wellness? That after worrying about our sleep, our exercise, our carbs, our calories, our drinking, our snacking, our meat, our vegetables, the provenance of our meat and vegetables, the number of steps we’ve taken in a day, how much time we spend sitting and/or standing and if our iPhones are killing us (probably while we sleep), the next step in mindfulness is our actual minds. And, if so, what does it mean? How do you even “do” mental health anyway?

The issue of mental health has never been more prominent. We’ve seen the headlines that suicide is the number one killer of men under 45 in the UK. We may know too that men report significantly lower life satisfaction than women. That last year the Jo Cox Loneliness Commission described male loneliness as “a silent epidemic”. From adverts on buses urging us to “Ask for help” by texting a number, to celebrities from Princes William and Harry to Stormzy opening up about depression, to the high-profile suicides of chef Anthony Bourdain and the DJ Avicii to plenty of low-profile ones too, fessing up to low moments has shifted up the agenda. The prevailing mood of rap music has moved from braggartry to insecurity: Drake’s lyrics are cries for help, while Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar and J Cole have all talked about depression. Mental illness may be dangerously close to becoming a badge of honour: the website bando.com sold out of £40 gold nameplate necklaces with the words “Anxiety” and “Depression” in a hip italic font. Their manufacturer says its intention is to “open a dialogue”.



Fessing up to low moments has shifted up the agenda



Of course some stigma still remains. Men are famously terrible at talking about anything emotional. But we can confidently say it’s not like it was in our fathers’ days. And definitely not like it was in our fathers’ fathers’ days.

Concern over mental wellbeing has produced a slightly more palatable term than #DoYouEvenMentalHealthBro? The new buzzword is “vulnerability” and it is everywhere. In 2010, the US academic Brené Brown gave a Ted talk titled “The Power of Vulnerability” that is by turns moving, convincing and syrupy in the language of Californian retreats and Silicon Valley start-ups. Riffing on hiding shame and pain behind façades, Brown contends: “There is another way: to let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen. To love with our whole hearts, even though there is no guarantee. To practice gratitude and joy… to believe that we’re enough”.

Through its website, podcasts, blogs and YouTube channel, the men’s “media platform” Rebel Wisdom, founded last year by former Channel 4 News film-maker David Fuller and meditation teacher Alexander Beiner, invites men to “get vulnerable”, among other things. Its new age-y literature states: “In today’s world, for men to be vulnerable and speak the truth is an act of rebellion. What if you just told the truth?”

In other words, if you have doubts, worries and agonies, talk about them. Drop the default strong-and-silent mode and rebadge your vulnerabilities as strengths: let them be seen.

Sounds fair enough, doesn’t it? And 36m views suggests Brené Brown, for one, is onto something. “One of the problems is that in the last 10 years or so, the world hasn’t really been interested in the psychology of gender,” the psychotherapist Nick Duffell told The Guardian earlier this year. “What we’ve been interested in are transgender issues and free choice and pronouns and gender as a social construct and abuses of power. But one of the things I’ve been working with is how powerless men often feel in the private sphere. Men are very unskilled when it comes to relationships and dealing with their emotions. We need to train them to be better at vulnerability, better at relating — and when they begin to do that, the power they develop is more authentic.”



Admitting vulnerability, relating, being more authentic… it sounds like a positive step forward when presented by authorities at Ted talks, on philosophy-based YouTube channels and by psychotherapists in newspapers. But what does it actually mean? Where do you start?

Ori Toor

In fact vulnerability — or #vulnerability — has spawned its own start-up culture. Sanctus in London’s Shoreditch has a mission to “change perceptions of mental health”. If you visit one of its Stories Live events, pitched somewhere between an AA meeting, a group therapy workshop and an open mic night, a phrase you will hear a lot is, “Thanks for being vulnerable”.

I attended a session in the summer, in a studio owned by UsTwo, the video game developer responsible for the hit puzzle-solving smartphone game Monument Valley. It took place in the Tea Building, next to the trendy private club Shoreditch House. There was a bar and comfy seating with chairs arranged facing an improvised stage. The stories I heard covered a range of mental health issues: there were moving testimonials on anxiety and depression, body dysmorphia, addiction, panic attacks, compulsions and obsessions. Participation was encouraged, with members of the audience — 50 or so men and women, with what must have been a median age of 30 — offering good-natured reflections on the torturous, but often tragicomic, stories. It was never gushing or mawkish, nor was it all earnest solemnity — there were laughs, too. People left feeling better, or at least comfortable about having shared the things that made them scared. Show me your tender bits, and I’ll show you mine. But Stories Live is only one element of what Sanctus does.



It also deploys therapists and coaches to go into businesses to build “safe spaces” where employees can open up about their worries. They are particularly popular with London-based tech companies. And business is good: they have a full-time roster of coaches and psychiatrists and a six-figure turnover. This puts them on track for their next ambition, to build the world’s first “mental health gym” on the high street. A sort of Barry’s Bootcamp for the mind.

“The perception of mental health is quite negative,” Sanctus’s founder, 26-year-old James Routledge, tells me. “People instantly think of suicide, stress, depression, anxiety. With physical health the first thing that comes to mind is probably fitness: healthy diets, healthy foods, being toned — all very positive connotations. So our mission is to get people to think about mental health in a much more positive light: being more self-aware, knowing more about yourself, your level of empathy, performance, productivity and creativity.

“The classic statistic,” he says, “is one-in-four people, in any given year, will struggle with a mental health issue. The flipside is three-in four-people will have [good] mental health. It’s about educating that mental health is a spectrum and it oscillates. So let’s focus on it day-to-day, proactively, just like we do with our physical health.”

Advice Sanctus advocates is journalling (writing down feelings), urban flâneuring (going for a walk), meditating and engaging in therapy, one-on-one or in a group. As with other entrepreneurs in this area, Routledge’s enthusiasm comes from personal experience. When the start-up he founded in his early twenties imploded, so did he. He suffered anxiety and panic attacks, and had no idea what was happening to him.

“It took a lot of work and talking to get through to the other side,” he says. “Now I always try and be honest, be open, be vulnerable and say when I’m struggling, or don’t think I’m good enough. Vulnerability is linked with being authentic and being authentic is hard. I was trying to present this image of myself, never being me. That led to a big disconnection and poor mental health.”



The notion of an authentic self is especially attractive to a person in psychic pain

Routledge’s comments are problematic. They presuppose that identity and personality are fixed, that there is some essential and authentic “self”. Yet our personalities, moods and views, the ways we present ourselves to others as well as to ourselves, are mutable: we’re a million different people from one day to the next, to paraphrase the old The Verve song lyric. To access that one single “you”, to switch to “being authentic”, is not just hard — it might be impossible.

The notion of an authentic self is especially attractive to a person in psychic pain: looked at one way, the common illnesses of anxiety and depression are maladies in the dysfunctional “I”. But even if it makes sense in the light of Routledge’s mission with Sanctus, the existence of a self is itself under attack: contemporary neuroscience suggests it’s merely a collection of chemical impulses. Buddhism, which advocates self-transcendence, has long held that it amounts to no more than a knot of transitory memories and responses encased in blood and bone.



Setting that aside, Routledge isn’t the first to struggle in the technology business, somewhere that, for all its utopian platitudes (Google: “Don’t be evil”; Facebook: “Bring people closer together”), can be an ultracompetitive and macho environment. Only the Paranoid Survive is the telling title of a 1998 business book by Andrew S Grove, president and CEO of Intel, the world’s biggest manufacturer of computer microchips. And Routledge found his frankness touched a nerve: vulnerability wasn’t just a useful self-development tool, it proved an effective business strategy, too.



If global market researcher Mintel reckons the industry for private health and fitness was worth £3.1bn in the UK in 2017, it’s easy to imagine mental fitness as the natural add-on to gym sessions — getting fit inside as well as out. More difficult to picture is what the psychic equivalent of a rowing machine would be, or what running a psychological 10km would entail. But perhaps that is to misunderstand Sanctus’s “mental health gym”.

In fact, the Stories Live event may be seen as a kind of prototype. “A safe space created between you and the Sanctus coach,” Routledge says. “I see our coaches like personal trainers. There will be group-based stuff, workshops, quiet spaces where people can disconnect, do journalling, meditation, flotation tanks and yoga. The thing we never ever want to lose is the importance of working on your mental health in a community with other humans… feeling like you can trust someone.”

Routledge is well aware that even the word “vulnerable” is problematic. Having a hard time at work may pale in comparison to, for example, the 300,000 people currently homeless in the UK, who are also vulnerable, though less likely to use the word as an Instagramable hashtag.

“I can’t compare feeling a bit worried about what people think to not having somewhere to sleep,” he says. “But I do think the narrative is a problem within mental health. When I was starting to feel anxious and having panic attacks, there was a part of it which didn’t feel like my problems were enough to share. You might not be homeless but it’s dangerous for people to start to think ‘My problems aren’t enough’.”

Ori Toor



At another mental health meet-up, I listen to 28-year-old George Adolphus introduce The Smile Tribe, a start-up with a website that talks about “Mind-Fit-Ness”: different grammar but identical semantics. The company’s aim is to enable you to “live a life you love”, and his presentation is on the theme of play: fashioning life into a game as a strategy to combat sadness, among other things.

His talk certainly plays to a receptive audience in a packed auditorium at the headquarters of consumer goods company Unilever near Blackfriars, in London, and organised by the Minds@Work Movement, a network of high-flying corporate employees including leading figures at The Bank Of England, HSBC and the law firms Clifford Chance and Herbert Smith Freehills, all of whom have pledged to destigmatise mental health in the workplace. With companies increasingly employing psychotherapists, offering wellness programmes and free yoga sessions, mental health has climbed the ranks of the workplace agenda. Whether that’s a cynical exercise in shoring up the bottom line (cheery workforces are more productive, and mental illness costs the economy up to £99bn annually) or genuinely well-intentioned is up for debate. What’s indisputable is that many of Minds@Work’s senior executives have had firsthand experience of the terrors of mental illness, either personally or peripherally.

Like Sanctus, The Smile Tribe host talks and workshops, introducing notions like “You are not your thoughts” (a common mindfulness technique that helps people dissociate from anxious rumination), and teaching keys to mental health. “Diet is important, exercise is important, connecting with people and building habits is important,” Adolphus says. It is also developing technologies to help, combining AI with CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy), with the aim of producing a kind of therapist-bot app to install on smartphones. Adolphus lights up when he begins to talk about what tech can do for mood.



“We need a Fitbit for the mind,” he says. “Something where we can measure progress in the same way that I run round the block and the next day try to run around it faster, and track all that through [running/cycling social network] Strava. People need the same thing with the words and thoughts they’re having.”

A glance at the App Store suggests there’s a busy market for meditation tools (Calm, Headspace), sleep improvers (Sleepio), mental health chat apps (TalkLife, Big White Wall) and mood-tracking utilities (Happy Not Perfect). Indeed, plenty of venture capital and tech talent is being gambled on apps-as-antidepressants, even if the best AI on offer is still a far cry from what makes therapy actually work between two humans: empathic understanding, congruence, and what the psychologist Carl Rogers called “unconditional positive regard” — being kind and listening to someone no matter who or what they are. The Smile Tribe is testing software that responds to users sharing their most intimate thoughts and worries, stuff they may never talk to anyone about. “If we can create this tool that enables people to check-in at any time, I’d see that as really powerful,” he says. “That’s the most heartwarming thing, and it’s why technology will improve things.”

"Emotional life tends to be more nuanced than simple imbalances in happiness and sadness"

The Smile Tribe isn’t alone in viewing sadness as a solvable problem: “Depression is just sadness for a long time, or sadness, worry or hopelessness you can’t shift,” Adolphus says. “We all have this in some form. I want to attach ourselves to mental health because the moment people hear the word ‘depression’ or ‘anxiety’ they think, ‘I need to go to the doctor and take medication’. But I don’t think most people need that. The majority just need some lifestyle tools to deal with it.”



Adolphus’s view could be seen as suspect, if not downright incorrect. The NHS website states: “Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you’re depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They’re wrong — it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression isn’t a sign of weakness or something you can ‘snap out of’ by ‘pulling yourself together’.”

The Smile Tribe’s philosophy is modelled on Adolphus’s own experiences. As a student at Bristol University he was suffering up to five panic attacks a day. “I was depressed and hiding everything. I had such bad social anxiety that I didn’t want to leave the house, I couldn’t get a job or go to interviews. I stopped seeing my friends.

“I got to the stage where I thought, ‘This isn’t how I want to live my life. I’m either going to give up and kill myself, or do everything I can to live a life I love. So how do I go about doing that?’ The first thing was that I’d be better off telling everyone how I felt, so I spent a day driving round all my friends’ houses. I changed my diet, looked at all the serotonin-inducing foods, balanced my blood sugar, stopped smoking and drinking, just cut it all out. Then I started reading about how you can reframe your thoughts and start seeing the world differently. Really quickly my life got better. I got to this place where I thought, ‘Oh my God, people don’t need to struggle! You can get out of this’. Now I want to shout about it.”

Maybe it worked for Adolphus, but is his view of depression somewhat narrow? It begs other questions, such as: what’s happiness got to do with mental health anyway? Is, say, depression an absence of happiness, or instead the loss of something else: meaning or calmness, for example? And second, recognising that mental illness can range from mild social anxiety to psychotic depression, burnout and suicidal intention, can an app, a gym or a meet-up do something that tried-and-tested clinical interventions can’t?



It’s surely right to be sceptical: emotional life tends to be more nuanced than simple imbalances in happiness and sadness, and the terrain of mental health is infinitely individuated. Its tragic obverse is mental illness which, it’s worth repeating, can be lethal. So how seriously should we take this talk of #vulnerability and mental fitness?

On the one hand, says Dr Ian Drever, a consultant psychiatrist who’s worked in The Priory and delivered talks at Minds@Work events, we should at least give it the time of day. “There’s significant value in realising that we are vulnerable, that we can become ill, that we have needs which we should acknowledge to ourselves. At The Priory, I saw a lot of the stereotypical alpha males in professions like law and banking who tried to soldier on, maintaining an aura of invincibility, only for it later to come crashing down when illness set in. For those guys, having a sense of vulnerability earlier on would have been helpful.”

As for mental fitness, he adds that learning skills can also be useful. “They'll make it easier for us to bat something off if life throws us a challenge, and it means that we can maintain better overall health, a greater sense of objectivity, and have some skills ready to deploy, right when we need them most, rather than waiting for a problem to strike and then seeking treatment — which, of course, can take time, during which the illness may worsen.”

But on whether any of this can be mediated through an app, Drever is wary. “That can never replace the power of seeing a real person,” he says. “And also it's becoming clear that too much time on phones, screens and social media is a huge problem, and can be positively damaging to mental health.” If in doubt, see a doctor.



Another strand of all this is that positive mental health has been adopted by media and organisations peddling yet another take on New Masculinity. In the era of #MeToo and Trump, calls for men to reassess who they are and how they behave has led to handwringing in the media. “There’s a narrative that masculinity is fundamentally toxic,” The Guardian reported. One aim of Rebel Wisdom is to reevaluate what it means to be male, through group yoga sessions, discussion of Jungian archetypes and group hugs.

“Taking our lead from the great psychologist Carl Jung, our experience is that everyone contains both a masculine and feminine side — and that it is only by consciously and deliberately developing both of them that we become fully present and embodied,” its website states. “But this is not the same as gender neutrality, quite the opposite — instead of seeing gender as a ‘spectrum’ — we can see it as two spectrums, an inner masculine and feminine in each of us. Our experience is that men need the support and challenge of other men to develop their masculine side. The kind of accountability, fierce loving energy that men can give each other”.

Unfortunately their biggest success to date has been a series of video interviews with Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist who advocates self-improvement while rallying against political correctness, who shot to fame via a combative interview with Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman in January — ironically, a former colleague of Rebel Wisdom founder David Fuller — that was notably light on any fierce, loving energy.

There’s a less reconstructed, more time-honoured way for men to confront any problem: attack it with maximum ferocity. And, currently, few people do ferocity better than 37-year-old Tyne and Wear-based Paul Mort and his Unstoppable Bastards project.



I heard Mort speak at the mental health-themed Getahead Festival in London. Among the yoga classes, protein bar stalls, meditation gurus and sober-raving he cut a singular figure: tattooed, garishly-attired and emphatic. His in-your-face Facebook posts and daily motivational emails are similarly energetic. One reads: “Before you get your knickers in a twist (some dude somewhere, WILL) I have a LOT of experience with depression not just through the boatloads of men I’ve coached but with MYSELF. Sh*t, depression quite literally STOLE at least a couple of years of my life”.

However, one of his promotional videos tells a more sober story: Mort is discovered on top of a cliff edge, casting back to the episode when he felt like taking his own life. The accompanying text reads “How a Bipolar Dad on the Verge of Suicide Took Back Control of His Life, Transformed His Business, Saved His Marriage and Became Unstoppable”. Self-doubting blokes show up to his events and leave transformed into postmodern warrior-monks, or so the social media posts suggest.

Plenty of venture capital and tech talent is being gambled on apps-as-antidepressants, even if the best AI on offer is a far cry from what makes therapy work: being kind and listening to someone no matter who or what they are

Mort offers coaching, online seminars and immersive programmes (which include workouts, meditation and men fighting each other on the beach) designed to build “Unstoppability”: his own brand of mental fitness. That encompasses five key areas: focus (your mindset), fitness (energy, body shape, health), family (relationships), finance (money, business, lifestyle) and fun.

Fun? “Interestingly enough,” Mort says, “that’s the area where people have the most problems when they come in. They don’t know what to do for fun that isn’t destructive.”



“Unstoppable is just a guy who isn’t perfect, isn’t a superhero, but understands how to deal with everyday stress, events, triggers, circumstances,” he says. “I say to the guys ‘Listen: those things aren’t going away. But you can just get better at dealing with them — an expanded capacity to deal with stress’. It’s sometimes the problem for most men that we think we’re going to get to this perfect life. But that life doesn’t exist.”

Mort has built a fanbase through ferocious, often comic honesty about his mental illness ordeals. Doctors had prescribed lithium (common for bipolar disorder) but, he says, “it was horrendous. It stopped the highs, the mania, but I just felt like shit all the time. And then I actually made some lifestyle changes.”

It remains to be seen if any of the businesses riding the current vogue for mental health will create a measurable difference in the stock of human wellbeing

In Mort’s mind, there is no crisis of masculinity apart from the fact men don’t know how to ask for help if they’re suffering. “Work hard, play hard — it's always been the same, we're just at a point where the stress is a bit higher.”

“My opinion — and this upsets some people — is that depression, anxiety and stress are all just a state. And you can manage that state,” he adds. “You can stay on top of it, but you can also change it quite quickly. That sounds quite harsh, but it’s the truth. It’s just a case of having the right tools, and staying on top of it.”

And the trick to all this? We’re back to #vulnerability. “I’ve had death threats and a lot of shit thrown my way for being open because men who aren’t open will get triggered by me being open. The great thing about vulnerability is it’s a starting point: you can’t really make a change until you're radically honest.



“The basic problem in all of this,” Mort concludes, “is that a lot of men see asking for help as a sign of weakness. Listen: men don't even read fucking instructions. Get something from Ikea and you've turned a cupboard into a table. It’s ’cos you didn't read the instructions. Read the fucking instructions!”

The irony is that when navigating the psychic topography of vulnerability, there are plenty of prescriptions but very few instructions. There is no clear path or model, partly because there’s no “masculinity”, only millions of men, each with their own idiosyncrasies, questions and pathologies. Meanwhile, the ambiguities can be anxiety-inducing enough in themselves. So what to do about it all? Maybe we just all need to calm the hell down.

If we’re to get philosophical here, bear in mind also what the stoic Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius said around 2,000 years ago: “Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be,” he wrote in Meditations. “Be one.”

Stoicism itself is one of the most effective therapies for depression (life is hard and tragic: deal with it) and philosophy may indeed be our best reader for the latest chapter in the How to Be a Man story.

One clue to the success of James Routledge’s Sanctus programme is how well it fits in with other contemporary lifestyle pursuits: habits such as mindfulness, meditation, veganism, yoga, practising gratitude and journalling which come badged “wellness” or “wellbeing” but all of which have their roots in religious practice. Even Sanctus’s name sounds devout, so perhaps a secular-spiritual method of dealing with modern torment is the wisest of all paths. Wasn’t it Jung who said that religions were “the world’s great psychotherapeutic systems”?



The other side of faith is doubt, and what’s most convincing and plausible about Routledge’s vision is that he readily admits he doesn’t claim to have all answers on how to “do” mental health, mental fitness or #vulnerability. He doesn’t see the Californian creed of constant self-betterment as the panacea, nor believe that technology alone will save us.

“We can't be overly positive and like, ‘Woo, it’s all good,’” he says. “Because that's not the case for some people. In the very early days of Sanctus, I probably still wanted it to be about being better, and how you can have better mental health. The more work I did in group sessions and one-on-ones, the more I learned about acceptance. If, as a brand, you're always telling people ways they can be better, then you're telling them they need to be better: you're telling them they're not good enough. That isn’t a message we want to send.”

It remains to be seen if any of the businesses riding the current vogue for mental health will create a measurable difference in the stock of human wellbeing: a reduction in suicide rates, for instance. There’s little to criticise in having a go at it. But it’s safe to say that while trends and technologies come and go, the human need for contact, fellowship and understanding endures.

Perhaps a better analogy of what Sanctus is, and will be, is like a church. “When I look at what a church is like,” Routledge says, “we're supposed to be this in essence: community, the confession box, confidants, structure. That's probably more what the Sanctus gym would look like.”

Today, it’s a genuinely radical idea. As it is written, love thy neighbour as thyself, in all thy vulnerability. Maybe it won’t make you happy. But it might just keep you sane.

DIEGO LUNA KNOWS MEXICO'S DRUG WAR HISTORY IS UGLY, BUT IT MUST BE TOLD

When we last left the world of Narcos—our world—we witnessed DEA agent Javier Peña (played with potent world-weariness by Pedro Pascal) hanging up his crime-fighting boots for good. He had plenty of reasons to take a bow; Pablo Escobar was dead, the Medellín and Cali Cartels had been vanquished, and Colombia's cocaine empire had gone to dust. But there's no feeling of victory, no sunset ride for a hero agent—only the quiet resignation that the so-called "drug war" he'd been fighting was a never ending one, in part because his own bosses in the United States government seemingly had no interest in ending it.



That sense of futility is palpable throughout Narcos: Mexico, now streaming on Netflix, which pulls the show's timeline all the way back to 1980 to illustrate how it all began. Diego Luna stars as Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, founder of the Guadalajara Cartel and the former boss of a guy you may have seen in the news lately. Chasing him is Enrique "Kiki" Camarena (Michael Peña), a DEA agent at a time when, as the show points out, there were more female officers in the NYPD than agents in the DEA. As their paths intersect, the real beneficiaries of the narco underworld—on both sides of the border—come into better focus.

It's the series' most biting season yet. And for Luna, who was born and raised in Mexico, the story is an ugly, but important one.

"We have to talk about this period of time," he tells me. "It’s crucial to understand why we’re reading what we are reading today."

Luna talked to Esquire about playing the "Rockefeller of Marijuana," how drugs and violence have reshaped his country, and what needs to be done to fix it.

He was initially reluctant to accept the role.

It's one of those times where my first impulse as an actor is to say no. Let's get out of this, let's escape as soon as possible before they even work out a deal. I've seen many efforts of telling the story of these people and failing badly. You have an even bigger responsibility, because behind these stories there is a lot of loss, and pain. You’re talking about people that lived this 30 years ago—it’s not that long, you know? But [showrunner Eric Newman] said to me, "Your voice is important." And when I realised that, and that I was going to have a chance to actually be involved in what we were doing and the story we were telling and its importance, I said "Okay, okay, I'll join."



Carlos Somonte/Netflix

Finding information about Félix Gallardo was not easy.

Growing up in Mexico, you have Caro Quintero, you have Amado Carrillo, you have El Chapo, all these names, these characters that people think they know better than anyone. [Gallardo] was much more of this discrete guy ... He understood the value of discretion. It was kind of cool to actually have to go back and do research to find out exactly who he was.

He sees his character as another victim in the drug war.

To me the most important part to recreate a character is to think about the context he was living in, and try to understand. It's very important to not talk about things as if they were black and white, that rhetoric is getting us to a very polarised world. No one is just "bad"—love, jealousy, ambition, regret, all those things are there, and they have reasons, you may not agree with them, but as an actor you have to understand those reasons in order to portray a character. You also understand that in this show, the lead is not Kiki Camarena, I'm not the lead, the lead in this story is cocaine, and how cocaine gets to you, and the system created here. They are victims of this system.

He blames militarisation for making the violence in Mexico worse.

The big part of recreating Mexico in the 80s is the sadness that comes to me, remembering how free the Mexico that I grew up in was, and how it is not the Mexico my kids are growing up in. It has changed because of this violence, because how long this violence has been ramping up, and in the last 12 years since [former Mexican president] Felipe Calderón decided to have a frontal war with drug trafficking in Mexico. Things just got out of control because there was no strategy behind it, and it's clearly a war we are all losing. It makes me very sad to have to accept that that is my country.

Drugs need to be treated as a matter of public health.

We think, "Oh, the drug dealers are violent because they are putting drugs in our pockets." No, it's the other way around. The battle is over demand. There's a gigantic market around the world—in the States, probably the biggest—and the moment there is a market, there is going to be a supplier. We have to see this as a health issue. And as soon as we start talking about demand, we can start accepting that it is an issue that belongs to all of us because the market is everywhere. If we don't try to fix it together, it will never get fixed.

Given our current border tension, this season is especially important now.

One thing to me that is clear is that there are criminals participating on both sides. And we have to accept that. We have to accept, for this structure to exist, every level of power is involved, and this corruption has got to both sides of the border. I wish when the series ends, people will start to ask themselves, "Why are young kids in countries like Mexico willing to join these organisations?" What pushes them there, you know? Because if we start analysing the issue from a different perspective, we are part of the issue.

'VICE' DIRECTOR ADAM MCKAY: "THE FACT WE ELECTED GEORGE BUSH PRESIDENT IS RIDICULOUS"

We last saw Christian Bale and Amy Adams together in 2013 for David O'Russell's black comedy American Hustle, in which the pair played a con-man and his seductive partner. Now their forthcoming film sees them join forces again, as they play former Vice-President of the United States Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne.



Vice, directed by comedy veteran Adam McKay, also stars Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush and Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld. The biopic charts Cheney's ascent from the early days of the Nixon White House to becoming 'the most powerful Vice President in history'.

McKay recently directed the The Big Short, which was nominated for Best Picture and saw Bale earn a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Cinema circles are speculating that Adams could finally take home an Oscar for her role after receiving five nominations but no Academy Award wins thus far.

Bale, who won an Oscar for his role in The Fighter, will likely be in the running come award season and the actor has duly piled on 45 pounds for the role.

Bale has been forbidden from contacting the former veep by his lawyers but told The Hollywood Reporter this week, "I would like to be able to sit and look Cheney in the eye and say why I feel like it's justified to tell his story. And I hope I will do it one day."



Adams, who was also interviewed commented that, "'It's a film about Dick, but Lynne was very accomplished. I like that she wasn't afraid to be ambitious at a time when ambition in women wasn't as encouraged."

Matt Kennedy

Similarly to how Michael Lewis' recent book exposed how easily Trump has underestimated the vast responsibilities of the presidency in terms of assembling the federal government, in Vice we see Cheney manipulating Bush into conceding power to him.

"I can handle the more mundane jobs," Cheney says in the trailer while Bush looks confused and chews on a chicken leg, "Overseeing bureaucracy, military, energy and err foreign policy".

"Yeah, right. I like that," Bush says nodding slowly.

Matt Kennedy / Annapurna Pictures

Though there's clearly comedy in how easily conned Bush was and how cunning his second-in-command proved, there has been some debate as to whether the film is a drama or a comedy.

"It’s a tricky thing, given what is going on in the world right now and you see the suffering that resulted from that era with Cheney and Bush," McKay told the Inquirer yesterday. "Yet, at the same time, we’re living with it now. The means that got us there are so ridiculous. The idea that George W. Bush, when he left college, worked for a tropical plant company and he had a 10-year gap in his employment history and we elected him President is ridiculous."

"And the idea that Cheney knew that this was an opportunity for power is undeniably funny," he added.

Greig Fraser / Annapurna Pictures

The Anchorman director went on to say that watching the film on one occasion had made him laugh whereas a second viewing left him in tears. A range of emotions viewers will be accustomed to experiencing in relation to politics.



Vice is released 25 January, 2019

TOM HARDY WILL RETURN AS “THE DEVIL DELANEY” IN ‘TABOO’ SERIES 2

Taboo, the gritty BBC drama written by Peaky Blinders’ Steven Knight and starring Tom Hardy, will return for a second series.

Executive producer Ridley Scott thanked the BBC and FX for "supporting Taboo at every stage so it could be the dark, dirty brute of a drama that it is".



He went on to say, “We’re thrilled people want to know what happens next and that the BBC and FX are up for more adventures with the devil Delaney and the league of the damned.”

The air date is yet to be revealed, but hopes were always high for a renewal. Knight told the Radio Times that he was confident the show could go on for at least two more series.

“We think it has got a two and a three certainly, that’s the plan,” Knight said. “After that who knows? This series is eight parts – it’s a lot of time.”

As for the plot, Knight says “James Delaney will continue to explore many realities as he takes his band of misfits to a new world”. Hardy’s character sailed off to The Azores under the American flag in the finale of season one, and the actor told Entertainment Weekly last year: “We’re onto the next stage. The key really is Colonnade. When he says, ‘We are Americans’, James is very ambiguous with how much information he’s going to give. In his mind, you will know when the time is right.”

THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS THINK IDRIS ELBA SHOULD BE THE NEXT JAMES BOND, SURVEY SAYS

The Elba/Bond debate has been raging for what, a decade now? One side argues that the Luther star would bring a steely charisma to the role, while the other side (middle-aged egg avatars who post Pepe the Frog memes to their 37 followers) will accept nothing less than Sean Connery in a toupee. So it goes.



America isn’t agonising over the subject quite as much as we are, though. According to a survey of 2,201 adults conducted by The Hollywood Reporter, 63 per cent of US Bond fans support the idea of Elba donning the tuxedo, and 53 per cent support the casting of a black James Bond.

Elba has downplayed the rumours many times, but toyed with fans in August by tweeting “My name’s Elba, Idris Elba”, only to shut down the suggestion that he’d signed on to replace Daniel Craig.

Elba has previously bemoaned the fact that race has framed the debate so far. He told the New York Times: "It’s interesting that the James Bond thing continues to go. I think it’s more about, we just want to have a black guy play James Bond rather than Idris Elba the actor play James Bond. That’s the part that I’m like, ‘Ugh, come on.’”



In his Esquire December issue cover story, Elba went one further, talking about his discomfort with being constantly referred to as a ‘black actor’.

“I don’t like the term ‘black actor’ in the first place. I don’t understand what that is. When we talk about Benedict Cumberbatch, we don’t call him a ‘white actor’.

He continued: "When you speak about van Gogh, or any other painter, they’re painters; they use all the colours in the spectrum. They don’t use colours confined to where they’re from.”

THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIME HAS ONLY GOTTEN BETTER WITH AGE

There are seldom few things in life that actually feel sacred. Your childhood home, the first falling snow of the season, the sound of the ocean at night–these experiences all share a deep, spiritual resonance. Art can evoke those same feelings, making you feel weightless, like gliding over hallowed ground. And while video games are just now starting to explore the depths of their potential as an artistic medium, 1998's The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time somehow transcended that threshold when it came out 20 years ago today.





Released on the now-primitive Nintendo 64, the game feels just as mysterious, tormented, joyous, and spirited as it did when it first debuted. While modern consoles can compute at hundreds of times the speed and complexity of what that chunky cartridge system could muster, in the two decades that have passed since Ocarina, very few titles have come close to the masterfully-woven craftsmanship, storytelling, and gameplay of what is perhaps gaming’s greatest work of art. Ever since the Boy Without A Fairy first set foot in the gaping mouth of the Great Deku Tree, players have been enraptured by this adventure, a lyrical piece of soul-searching that somehow feels equal parts Walt Whitman and Labyrinth.

But what is it about Ocarina that still intoxicates players after all these years? Is it the gameplay, with its then-groundbreaking Z-targeting system, honing players into vicious, focused battles in an open world that feels as expansive as it is detailed? Or perhaps the unforgettable Koji Kondo score, an uplifting, and, at times, impossibly somber, soundtrack that still stands to this day as a benchmark for gaming music?

Many folks would point to the design breakthroughs made in Ocarina, one of the first titles to push the console to its graphical limits, realising the full potential of what could be created on that 64-bit canvas. The writing, too, brought video games into the modern day, with a cast of idiosyncratic townspeople and central characters who felt, perhaps for the first time in the history of the medium, like living, breathing, sentient creatures with feelings and thoughts and plans all their own.



To me, the secret to Ocarina’s magic is time itself. The reason it has persisted throughout the decades, played and replayed again and again, is because it singularly captures the inevitability of time. The time-travel mechanic in Ocarina, though informed by titles of Zelda past, was the defining moment for the N64 game, adding a layer of perspective to the experience that electrifies the imagination and gives voice to the unspeakable cruelty–and beauty–of nature’s always-ticking clock.

Fans of the game will remember their first experience removing the Master Sword from its consecrated altar, and traveling through time into early adulthood. For many of us, the game felt very relatable from the onset, because we first played it as kids, like the young Link of the game’s first act–an adolescent with big hopes, dreams, and questions about what lie ahead. And if you were raised in the 90s, and became an adult in the 2010s, you may connect deeply with the adult Link of the game’s later sequences, since the world of his adulthood is far weirder and more broken than what we ever expected.

In Ocarina, Link is sealed away in a sort of hibernation for seven years by a group of Sages who hope that when he awakens, he can wield the mighty Master Sword and strike down the dark lord Ganondorf, who has taken over Hyrule in his lust for the all-powerful Triforce. The experience of waking up seven years later, all of a sudden transitioning from a little boy to a young man in the blink of an eye–it feels all too familiar.

When Link ventures out into the adult world for the first time, the beauty of his youth is replaced by a harrowing expanse of loss and ruin. The plants have grown rampant, the skies have grown dark, and the Castle Town’s once-bustling Market is replaced by a screeching, desolate sprawl of monsters known as ReDeads, which likely inspired nightmares for years to come. Link soon finds that the reality of adulthood is an ugly one, and while many of the natural wonders of his world, like the ebullient waters of Lake Hylia, or the exhilarating cliffs of the Gerudo Desert, are still intact, many of his former compatriots have become corrupted, restless, or lost entirely.

It’s in this way that Ocarina of Time transfixes players, exploiting the tragically-slighted hopes of our youth, and the devastating isolation of our newfound adulthood responsibilities, to make for an experience that beautifully bridges the gap between both the young and old forms of our ever-growing selves. For those of us, and I’m sure there are many, that sometimes feel like adulthood is like waking up in the middle of a very long sleep from deep in our childhood, there is simply no game that touches our hearts quite like Ocarina. And just as there is only one Hero of Time–though the same story can be told and retold for generations to come–there will only ever be one Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

HAS THE 'AVENGERS 4' TITLE CHANGED THREE TIMES ALREADY?

The ongoing attempts to suss out what the name of the fourth Avengers film will be has created its own Twitter microclimate, in which rumours take on lives of their own and steadfastly refuse to die, returning in weird new mutations all the time. One of the biggest of late is the idea that the film has switched titles three times already, and could do again.



Jeremy Conrad, who's an authority on all things Marvel and runs the YouTube channel MCUCosmic, has suggested that the title has changed three times in the last year or so, after various actors and staff accidentally let slip the film's title - or at least its working titles.

Zoe Saldana, who plays Gamora, mentioned the name Avengers: Gauntlet - though that could also be Avengers: Infinity Gauntlet, which sounds a bit over-literal to us and was denied by co-director Joe Russo - while one of the film's special effects workers is said to have let the cat out of the bag while doing a little update on the credits section of his website, where he listed the film's title as Avengers: End Game.

It was posted as a rumor. For a title that changed three times over the last year, it’s always possible it changed a fourth time. But I don’t think it did. https://t.co/MuFndUw0qm — Jeremy Conrad (@ManaByte) November 20, 2018

The third potential name is Avengers: Annihilation, which sounds pretty plausible: the comic series explored the cosmic side of the Infinity Gauntlet's universe-halving powers. Some particularly intense fans have said that the Russo brothers' cryptic Instagram post - which asked viewers to "look hard" - backs this up, as the easel and the stepladder in the centre of the frame form two As.

Then again, it would be quite funny if, after all this, it was just called Avengers 4. Not laugh out loud funny, but mildly funny.

‘THE MANY SAINTS OF NEWARK’: A CRUCIAL CHARACTER HAS JUST BEEN CAST IN ‘THE SOPRANOS’ PREQUEL

Many late DiMeo family members are elegised over in The Sopranos, but no one’s legacy had as big an impact on the show as Richard 'Dickey' Moltisanti.



As Tony Soprano’s beloved late cousin, his death was the driving force behind the boss’ paternalistic dedication to Dickey’s son, Christopher, whose struggles with addiction proved a ever-present problem for the mob.



He never featured in the show’s run, but he could be a major player in David Chase’s upcoming prequel film, The Many Saints of Newark. According to Variety, American Hustle actor Alessandro Nivola has just been cast as the infamous Sopranos crime figure.

The show will likely follow Dickey’s relationship with a young Tony after his father, Johnny Boy Soprano, is arrested and put behind bars. In the original series it’s revealed that Dickie falls in love with his own father’s young new wife, so that could also feature.

HBO

The prequel film will be written by David Chase and Sopranos veteran Lawrence Konner, who also wrote on Boardwalk Empire. Directing duties, however, have been handed to Game of Thrones’ Alan Taylor.

GEORGE R.R. MARTIN SAYS HIS NEW BOOK HAS SOME VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR DAENERYS

Within George R.R. Martin's universe of A Song of Ice and Fire, the past is never forgotten. Ancient legends, stories, and prophecies aren't buried ancient history—they are events that are still directing the present and future. Take Bran for example: a character whose ability to look into the past dictates the fate of the human's war with the threat north of the wall.



So, even if you're not A Song of Ice and Fire completist, Martin's new book Fire & Blood will hold some key information about what's to come in the upcoming conclusion to his beloved fantasy series.

As he's made clear already, Fire & Blood is not a traditional novel. This is not Winds of Winter. Rather, this is a history of the Targaryen family that covers about 150 years, written as a text book by the Archermaester Gyldayn. He's also noted that there are a few details in Fire & Blood that could hint at what's to come from A Song of Ice and Fire.

In a new video debuting exclusively on Esquire.com, Martin explains that even Daenerys herself could learn a thing or two from Fire & Blood.

"This is a book that Daenerys might actually benefit from reading, but she has no access to Archermaester Gyldayn's crumbling manuscripts. So she's operating on her own there," Martin says in the clip. "Maybe if she understood a few things more about dragons and her own history in Essos, things would have gone a little differently."



So, what could be some of these details?

As he noted in another one of these videos, Daenerys ancestor Aegon the Conqueror decided to take over Westeros and unify the Seven Kingdoms, not out of a pure desire for power, but a vision.

"There is a lot of speculation that in some sense he saw what was coming 300 years later, and wanted to unify the Seven Kingdoms to be better prepared for the threat that he eventually saw coming from the north—the threat that we are dealing with in A Song of Ice and Fire," Martin said.



If Aegon saw the threat of the White Walkers coming through some sort of vision, that could possibly mean he saw himself or one of his heirs as The Prince That Was Promised. These heirs being either Daenerys or Jon Snow.

But, even beyond prophecies and visions, this history in Fire & Blood details the last living dragons hundreds of years before Daenerys' own dragons were born. Certainly there's much she could learn of tactics, and even just responsible dragon parenting.

Fire & Blood is out on 20 November, and available on Amazon.

MY FAVORITE THANKSGIVING TRADITION IS LISTENING TO THIS ONCE-A-YEAR PODCAST ABOUT PAUL BLART: MALL COP 2

Some people watch football on Thanksgiving. Others go see a movie or, full from dinner, take a nap or go for a walk. But me? I listen to this podcast about Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. I've never actually seen the film, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. However, I do consider myself a Kevin James enthusiast. I spent an entire year recapping every episode of Kevin Can Wait. So, when I came across a podcast in which a group of comedians vowed to watch and review PBMC2 every American Thanksgiving until their mortal souls left this Earth, it seemed extremely my shit.



Comedy podcasters Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy (from the podcast, My Brother, My Brother, and Me) along with Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery (from podcast The Worst Idea of All Time) began this lifelong journey on November 26, 2015 with their first episode of Til Death Do Us Blart. It started as a simple review of the film—the guys going through it and recapping the plot while providing commentary. That first episode was longer than the actual run-time of PBMC2. None of them have seen the first Paul Blart: Mall Cop.

If you think a 94-minute Kevin James movie with a five percent score on Rotten Tomatoes wouldn't be enough to provide material for what has, to date, been nearly five hours of podcast content, you'd be wrong.

Over the years, these poor doomed men have dug into the possibility of Paul Blart's immortality, the tragedy of the title character's broken soul, the theory that one character is a ghost haunting the casino where the film takes place, and a possible concurrent National Lampoon movie happening simultaneously with PBMC2. They've gone frame by frame through the heist. They've discussed the possibility of the main villain being sent by God. They've discussed Paul Blart's problematic treatment of women and the films incessant fat shaming—and they still have a lifetime of podcasts to go. In fact, one of their theories was so convincing, it works with my theories of Kevin Can Wait and the greater Kevin James Cinematic Universe.



If one of the hosts should die, they pass this curse on to someone else. And it's a curse I'd gladly take—I'll be listening to the podcast until the end of linear time anyway.

THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE THIS TIMELESS

Fred W. McDarrah

In 1978, John Irving published his fourth novel—the one that became his first bestseller. Four decades later, The World According to Garp remains one of Irving's most masterful books. Following the life of its titular character T. S. Garp, Irving's comic novel is full of idiosyncratic characters—the successful writer Garp, his accidental feminist icon mother, a former football player turned transgender activist, and a supporting cast of assassins and suburban seductresses and cult members and unicycling bears and fortune tellers. Its scope is large, its storytelling Dickensian, and it perfectly encapsulated contemporary American culture at its most divisive and malignant. Two of its central themes are those of sexual violence and intolerance, subjects that Irving felt were at their peak when he was writing the book that would make him a household name.





To celebrate the 40th anniversary of Garp's publication (and its first ebook edition), Irving looks back on his groundbreaking novel and considers how it reflects our current times—a truth he did not expect when he was writing it decades ago. As he says in the following introduction to the anniversary edition, exclusive to Esquire.com, he did not anticipate the dark themes of his comic novel to be so timeless: "It’s not good news that Garp is still relevant."

Twenty years ago, which was twenty years after The World According to Garp was published, I wrote an afterword to the novel. Rewriting is the unglamorous part of creating, but revision is essential for clarity. In rewriting this new introduction to Garp, of course I found things to cut or change in that 1998 afterword, and I found a lot of necessary things to add.

In retrospect, it’s unnecessary to say that Garp is a worst-case scenario or that I am a doomsayer novelist, but in 1972–75—when I was teaching at the Writers’ Workshop in Iowa City, where I began writing Garp—I was worried that the subject of sexual hatred (of intolerance of sexual minorities, and sexual differences) would be outdated before I finished the novel. In 1976–77, when I was living in Massachusetts and Vermont, where I finished Garp, it was inconceivable to me that the sexual violence I was writing about would long endure. In short, I thought sexual discrimination was too backward and too stupid to last.

In 1978, when Garp was published, I thought I’d written a period piece. Garp is an angry and a comic novel—a feminist novel and an ode to the women’s movement, which is at once exalted and satirized—but, above all (I thought), Garp is a period piece. I was wrong. The World According to Garp isn’t prescient, but sexual hatred hasn’t gone away. It’s not good news that Garp is still relevant. We should be ashamed that sexual intolerance is still tolerated, but it is.

My eldest child, Colin, who is now fifty-three, was twelve when he first read Garp—in manuscript, and with me awaiting his reaction. There are scenes that are unsuitable for twelve-year-olds. Although Garp was my fourth novel, it was the first one Colin could read. I remember feeling proud but nervous at the prospect of being judged by one of my children; that the book was dedicated to Colin, and to his younger brother, Brendan, made the moment more tense.



In 1978, when Garp was published, I thought I’d written a period piece.

Everyone knows the two most common questions that are asked of any novelist. What is your book about? And: Is it autobiographical? These questions and their answers have never been of compelling interest to me; if it’s a good novel, the questions and the answers are irrelevant. Yet while my twelve-year-old son was reading Garp, I anticipated that these were the questions he would ask me, and I thought very hard about how I might answer him.

Now, forty years later—having written fourteen novels—it is obvious to me that I have never thought as hard about my answers to those “irrelevant” questions as I did when Colin was reading Garp.

While Colin kept reading, I agonized over what the novel was “about.” To my horror, and full of self-loathing, I jumped to the conclusion that the book was about the temptations of lust—lust leads just about everyone to a miserable end. There is a chapter called “More Lust,” as if there weren’t enough already. I was ashamed of how much lust was in the book, not to mention how punitive a novel I thought it was; every character in the story who indulges his or her lust is severely punished. Among the culprits and the victims, mutilations abound: characters lose eyes and arms and tongues—even penises!





It had seemed at the time, when I was beginning the novel, that the polarization of the sexes was a dominant theme; the story was about men and women growing further apart. Look at the plot: a remarkable, albeit outspoken, woman (Garp’s mother, Jenny Fields) is killed by a lunatic male who hates women; Garp himself is assassinated by a lunatic female who hates men. Garp is a sexual assassination story.

“In this dirty-minded world,” Jenny thinks, “you are either somebody’s wife or somebody’s whore—or fast on your way to becoming one or the other. If you don’t fit either category, then everyone tries to make you think there is something wrong with you.” But there is nothing wrong with Garp’s mother. In her autobiography, Jenny writes: “I wanted a job and I wanted to live alone. That made me a sexual suspect. Then I wanted a baby, but I didn’t want to have to share my body or my life to have one. That made me a sexual suspect, too.” Being what she calls a “sexual suspect,” who becomes a feminist icon, makes Jenny a target of misogynists—just as Garp, her son, becomes a target of radical feminists.

The principal point about Garp’s mother is stated in the first chapter: “Jenny Fields discovered that you got more respect from shocking other people than you got from trying to live your own life with a little privacy.” Today, forty years later, Jenny’s discovery seems more credible—not to mention, more defensible—than it was in 1978.

There was a time when Jenny threatened to take over the novel, when I wasn’t at all sure if Garp or his mother was the main character; something of my indecision remains. When I wrote Garp, I was more on his side than on Jenny’s—as a writer. Garp resents being a literary but unknown fiction writer, at a time when his mother is famous for her feminist autobiography. At the time I was writing Garp, I was a literary but unknown novelist; even though Jenny was my fictional creation, a part of me surely resented her success, too.



Garp is a political novel, and the politics of sexual intolerance and suppression haven’t gone away.

The World According to Garp was my first bestseller; in hardcover, it sold fewer than a million copies, but Garp sold six million paperbacks, in English, and it was the first of my novels to be translated. Of the utmost importance to me, it is the novel that allowed me to become a fulltime writer. Over time, I began to like Jenny more, and I found I liked Garp a little less. To put it simply: Garp is petulant about his mom’s success; yet she does more for the world than he does. Over time, my sexual politics have aligned with Jenny’s. The World According to Garp was always a feminist novel, but in the passage of time I’ve become more of a feminist. Why? Because the inequalities and discrimination women faced in the start-up days of the women’s movement haven’t gone away. Because the anti-abortion zealots—their subjecting of women to child-birth, by denying them a choice about abortion, and the ongoing second-class treatment of women by the Roman Catholic Church and the so-called pro-life proponents—haven’t gone away. That’s why. Garp is a political novel, and the politics of sexual intolerance and suppression haven’t gone away.

Roberta Muldoon, the transgender woman who was a former tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles, is a hero in this novel, and—for forty years, and counting—a personal hero of mine. Roberta is a mediator between Garp and Jenny, and the only character in the novel who loves Garp and his mother equally; Roberta is a model of stability in a novel about instability. In forty years, I’ve gotten over Garp and Jenny, but I’m still writing about Roberta. Miss Frost, the transgender librarian in In One Person, came from Roberta Muldoon. Flor, the transgender prostitute in Avenue of Mysteries, came from Roberta and Miss Frost.

Meanwhile—back in 1977, in the privacy of his room—Colin was reading on and on. The World According to Garp would never have satisfied a twelve-year-old if it had been only a novel about a novelist, though much of what mattered to me about the book was exactly that. I shall always see Garp prowling his neighborhood at night, taking a dim view of his neighbors’ television sets. “There is the faint, trapped warble from some televisions tuned in to The Late Show, and the blue-gray glow from the picture tubes throbs from a few of the houses. To Garp this glow looks like cancer, insidious and numbing, putting the world to sleep. Maybe television causes cancer, Garp thinks; but his real irritation is a writer’s irritation: he knows that wherever the TV glows, there sits someone who isn’t reading.”

And what of the Under Toad? Colin was familiar with its source. It was his brother, Brendan, who misunderstood him one summer at the beach on Long Island. “Watch out for the undertow, Brendan,” Colin warned him—at the time, Brendan was six. Colin was ten. Brendan had never heard of an undertow; he thought Colin said Under Toad. Somewhere, under the water, lurked a dangerous toad.

“What can it do to you?” Brendan asked his brother.

“Pull you under, suck you out to sea,” Colin said.

That did it for Brendan at the beach—he wouldn’t go near the ocean.

It was weeks later when I saw him standing at some distance from the water’s edge, staring into the waves.

“What are you doing?” I asked him.

“I’m looking for the Under Toad,” Brendan said. “How big is it? What color is it? How fast can it swim?”

The World According to Garp wouldn’t be the same without the Under Toad. Thank you, Brendan.



Colin didn’t ask me what the book was “about”—he told me. “It’s about the fear of death, I think,” Colin began. “Maybe, more accurately, the fear of the death of children—or of anyone you love.”

I remembered then that, among my early attempts to begin the novel, I had long ago begun with what would become the last sentence (“. . . in the world according to Garp, we are all terminal cases”), and I recalled how that last sentence had moved through the book; I kept pushing it ahead. It was once the first sentence of the second chapter; later it was the last sentence of the tenth chapter, and so on, until it became the end of the novel—the only possible ending. Not surprisingly, Garp describes a novelist as “a doctor who sees only terminal cases.”

Yet Colin, my twelve-year-old, surprised me by telling me what my book was about. The “Mrs. Ralph” chapter, my first false beginning, begins as follows: “If Garp could have been granted one vast and naïve wish, it would have been that he could make the world safe. For children and for grownups. The world struck Garp as unnecessarily perilous for both.” At age twelve, Colin had zeroed in on that. Garp lives in “a safe suburb of a small, safe city,” but neither he nor his children are safe. “Just be careful!” Garp is always telling his children, as I am still telling mine.

It is a novel about being careful, and about that not being enough.

The real beginning to the book, the one I finally chose, describes Jenny’s habit of carrying a scalpel in her purse. Jenny is a nurse, and an unmarried woman who wants nothing to do with men; she carries the scalpel for self-defense. Garp begins with an act of violence—Jenny cuts a soldier, a stranger who thrusts his hand under her dress (her nurse’s uniform). “Garp’s mother, Jenny Fields, was arrested in Boston in 1942 for wounding a man in a movie theater.” Finally, it was just that simple: I began at the beginning of the main story, before Jenny is pregnant with Garp—at the moment she decides she wants to have a baby without having a husband.

I was happy that Colin also didn’t ask me if the novel was autobiographical. But a year after the publication of Garp, I visited the Northfield Mount Hermon School—an independent secondary school in Massachusetts. I had been invited to give a reading to the students, and I’d accepted the invitation because Colin had recently been admitted to the school—he would be a student there in the coming academic year— and I thought it would be an opportunity for Colin to see something of the place and meet a few of the young men and women who would soon be his fellow students. Therefore Colin came with me to the reading, after which there were some questions from the audience. (It had been announced to the audience that Colin would be attending Northfield Mount Hermon in the fall; he’d already been introduced to the crowd.) Unexpectedly, a very pretty young woman asked Colin a question; she didn’t ask me.

“Is Garp your dad—is your father Garp?” the girl asked.

Poor Colin! He must have been embarrassed, but you would not have known it from his unflappable composure; he was a little younger than the assembled students, but he suddenly struck me as much older and more wary than most of them. Furthermore, he was an expert on The World According to Garp.



“No, my dad isn’t Garp,” Colin replied, “but my father’s fears are Garp’s fears—they are any father’s fears.” (Colin was fourteen, going on fifty-three.) So that’s what The World According to Garp is about—a father’s fears. As such, the novel is and isn’t “autobiographical.”

I may have written this novel forty years ago, but I go back there almost every day—back to those fears. Even the smallest detail of The World According to Garp is an expression of fear; even the curious pockmark on the face of the Viennese prostitute is an expression of that most terrible fear. “The silvery gouge on her forehead was nearly as big as her mouth; her pockmark looked to Garp like a small, open grave.” (A child’s grave.)

When Garp was published, people who’d lost children wrote to me. “I lost one, too,” they told me. I confessed to them that I hadn’t lost any children. I’m just a father with a good imagination. In my imagination, I lose my children every day.

In the early and mid-1970s, when I was writing Garp, I thought my country would never be as divided again as it was then. I was wrong.

In the early and mid-1970s, when I was writing Garp, I thought my country would never be as divided again as it was then. I was wrong. In 1968, Nixon had been elected on the promise that he would end the war in Vietnam. He didn’t get around to it right away. When Saigon fell, in 1975, President Nixon—facing impeachment—had already resigned from office. Nixon, of course, should never have been elected in the first place. Sound familiar?

Now (as of this writing) we have President Trump—a narcissistic vulgarian, a xenophobic blowhard, and a fascist bully. In October 2017, Trump’s Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ruled that transgender citizens were not protected from workplace discrimination; Sessions argued that Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination “does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender status.” Yes, several federal appeals courts have ruled against the Attorney General’s war on the LGBTQ community, but President Trump and the Department of Justice are clearly hostile to LGBTQ rights. What would Roberta say?

We live in sexually intolerant times. That’s why this forty-year-old novel isn’t out-of-date, but it should be. The World According to Garp was written in what I believed was a sad time. Isn’t this a sad time, too? Isn’t my country more divided today than when Garp was a work-in-progress? I’m reminded, almost every day, of my favorite lines from Shakespeare—what Edgar says at the end of King Lear.

The weight of this sad time we must obey: Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.

It’s true that The World According to Garp is a protest novel. Yet, when I was writing it, I never imagined I’d still be protesting forty years later.

JOHN KELLY OUGHT TO BE SHAMED OUT OF PUBLIC LIFE FOR THIS

Remember when White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was one of the "grown-ups" who was going to keep El Caudillo Del Mar-A-Lago in check, defusing the president*'s worst impulses and making sure the dosages were all correct at the beginning of Executive Time every day?

Yeah, that was cool. From the Military Times:



The new “Cabinet order” was signed by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, not President Donald Trump. It allows “Department of Defense military personnel” to “perform those military protective activities that the Secretary of Defense determines are reasonably necessary” to protect border agents, including “a show or use of force (including lethal force, where necessary), crowd control, temporary detention, and cursory search.”...

Some of those activities, including crowd control and detention, may run into potential conflict with the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act. If crossed, the erosion of the act’s limitations could represent a fundamental shift in the way the U.S. military is used, legal experts said. The Congressional Research Service, the non-partisan research agency for Congress, has found that “case law indicates that ‘execution of the law’ in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act occurs (a) when the Armed Forces perform tasks assigned to an organ of civil government, or (b) when the Armed Forces perform tasks assigned to them solely for purposes of civilian government.” However, the law also allows the president “to use military force to suppress insurrection or to enforce federal authority,” CRS has found.

There is no legal basis for this at all. There is no "insurrection," except perhaps in the Cabinet Room. There is no threat to federal authority. The refugees, however many finally get here, are going to want hot soup and blankets.

There is no practical basis for it, either. The troops were shuffled to the border as campaign props. They allegedly were defending the country against an influx of shoeless Central American toddlers in whose midst—we were told—were invisible MS-13 Terrorist Shock Troops. The election passed. The White House got its ass kicked from hell to breakfast, and, as an open admission that the whole thing was a fake, the troops started coming home in time for Thanksgiving. And now, this.

Kelly said in the signed directive that the additional authorities were necessary because “credible evidence and intelligence” have indicated that the thousands of migrants who have now made their way to the U.S. checkpoint near Tijuana, Mexico, “may prompt incidents of violence and disorder” that could threaten border officials.

This is a crock and Kelly should be shamed out of public service for it. He's arguing, apparently, that, because mobs in Mexico have attacked the refugees in and around Tijuana, he needs live-fire military because people might attack them here. (Is he authorizing deadly force against the lunatics in camo that are flooding southward to help stem off the "invasion"? Our lines are open.)

Lawrence O'Donnell has been saying for months now that Kelly is shot through with the essential bigotry that blighted his native Boston when Kelly was growing up there, a little while before O'Donnell grew up in Dorchester. I'm starting to wonder if O'Donnell's been right all along. This is a violation of the oath Kelly took to the Constitution. This is a norm that cannot be allowed to fall.

AMERICA DESERVES BETTER THAN THIS GLITCHING SIMULATION OF A RACIST SENATOR

Cindy Hyde-Smith, by the grace of God and a distracted moment on the part of Governor Phil Bryant, the junior Republican senator from Mississippi, would like you to know that the president* is coming down to hold rallies on her behalf very soon. She would like you to get tickets to these rallies. She would like you to know this very much. She would like you to know this so much that, on Tuesday night, in her debate against her Democratic opponent, former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, she plugged the events twice, in almost identical language, in both her opening and closing statements.



This was not the only time in the debate that Hyde-Smith repeated herself. It happened so often—especially on the phrases "Mississippi values" and "Second Amendment freedoms." Her campaign negotiated rules—no audience, no press in the room—that guaranteed a certain level of boredom but, Lord save us, Hyde-Smith couldn't even abide by those.

According to Ashton Pittman of the Jackson Free Press, the candidates were not supposed to use prepared notes, but Hyde-Smith's people insisted on them and she showed up carrying what appeared to be a disassembled Gutenberg Bible to which she regularly referred. (By Pittman's count, 20 times.) Cindy Hyde-Smith never should have been on that stage. She never should have been in the United States Senate. I'm not entirely sure she's qualified to be the host of a cable-access show in Tupelo—where the president* is going to campaign for her, and did she forget to mention that?

Beep. Beep. Page Not Found.



Hyde-Smith greets Brett Kavanaugh in her office on July 25, 2018 in Washington, DC. Getty Images

Espy, on the other hand—well, he's an African American Democrat running in Mississippi, so he's got that going against him. He's a retread; he was a congressman over 30 years ago and he was Secretary of Agriculture over 20 years ago. (During the debate, as part of his bipartisan bona fides, Espy mentioned a bill of his that President Ronald Reagan had signed in 1986.) He has a very narrow path to the Senate, so he naturally let a few fat pitches go by.



For example, Hyde-Smith has been belaboring him for weeks now over lobbying Espy did on behalf of Cote d'Ivoire's dictatorial leader, Laurent Gbagbo, currently on trial before the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. This is undoubtedly a bad thing. But it was the evening of the day on which the president*—who, in case you didn't know, is coming to Mississippi to campaign for Cindy Hyde-Smith—ran interference for the butchers of Riyadh against the findings of the U.S. intelligence community really the day you want to pillory somebody else for slow-dancing with murderous foreign satraps? I'd say no, but Espy let that one go sailing slowly through the strike zone.

Ordinarily, a Senate race in Mississippi would stay in Mississippi, but Hyde-Smith has managed to nationalize this one because she apparently has studied closely the attempt by Sharron ("A chicken in every emergency room!") Angle to unseat Harry Reid in Nevada a few years back.

Her most conspicuous moment in this regard came when she said that, if a longtime supporter asked her, she'd sit in the front row at "a public hanging." Then she got caught on video supporting the suppression of the franchise among college students. Now there are pictures of her dressed up as a Confederate infantryperson. (Judging from the debate, if her handlers told Hyde-Smith to dress up like Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, her basic programming would make her do it.) Because of all of this, a number of American corporations—Walmart, AT&T, Union Pacific, Leidos & Boston Scientific—have asked for their campaign donations back.

So, attention must be paid. In the debate, when asked about the public hanging business, with all that entails in Mississippi's history, Hyde-Smith looked down at the thick sheaf of paper in her hand and then offered the following quarter-assed apology:

"You know, for anyone that was offended by my comments, I certainly apologize. There was no ill will, no intent whatsoever in my statements. I have worked with all Mississippians. It didn’t matter their skin color type, their age or their income. That’s my record.”

She then went on to bleat about how Espy and his liberal, liberal, LIBERAL! backers had "twisted" and "weaponized" her words against her. (Ed. Note: there's video.) This was an another answer that caught too much of the plate, and at which Espy, at long last, took a full cut.

“Well, no one twisted your comments because your comments were live — you know, they came out of your mouth. I don’t know what’s in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth.”

Mississippi seems to be preparing to elect to a full term in the United States Senate a CGI extra from a reboot of Gone With The Wind who, if she's ever had an original thought, it died of despair and abandonment. I know, I know, it's Mississippi. But, still, the American republic in the 21st century ought to be able to do better than this.

TRUMP DOESN'T CARE THAT HIS POLITICAL STUNT MEANS TROOPS AT THE BORDER WILL MISS THANKSGIVING WITH THEIR FAMILIES

Nobody seemed too bothered when, in the homestretch of a campaign, the President of the United States used the military as a political tool to try to sway an election. Using the state's security apparatus like this is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes, and Trump did so on the basis of a largely trumped-up crisis, but all that took a backseat to the all-encompassing terror of The Caravan. Remember The Caravan? It was the hit sequel to The Ebola Panic (2014) and The Email Protocol (2016): a bad-faith Republican election stunt to monger the fear and get the old white people out to the polls, which cable news and the nation's biggest newspapers dutifully bit on as a major issue.



It was an obvious campaign ploy: the president—who executive-produced all three of the fine films above—tweeted 45 times about the border and at least nine times about The Caravan in the lead-up to Election Day. It was a staple of his rally speeches. In the time since, his mentions of the supposed "invasion" have dropped off precipitously, even as the group has gotten closer. Cable news has matched this disingenuous arc, maybe because there isn't nearly as much of a story when the president isn't yelling about it. There have been caravans before, and most in the current one are men, women, and children seeking asylum—as is their right under international law and treaties to which the U.S. is a signatory—on the basis they're fleeing chaos and violence in their home countries. In the Before Times, we might've called them refugees.

Meanwhile, the more than 5,000 troops Trump deployed were not actually authorized to engage the Caravaners: they were there to back up border patrol with "office support, transportation, and building up infrastructure." The president apparently plans to give them authority to "protect border personnel," though that hasn't yet happened. The drawdown will begin soon—not exactly a sign of an escalating crisis, even if there's been some unrest on the Mexican side of the border as migrants arrive in Tijuana. But what is absolutely clear is that more than 5,000 troops will be stationed in the southwest desert in spartan conditions—with no combat pay and little electricity—on Thanksgiving Day, pulled away from their families largely as part of a political stunt.



With the holiday fast approaching Tuesday, the president was asked about this. Here's his response:

JUST IN - President Trump, asked about the troops he sent to the border, who will be spending Thanksgiving away from their families: “Don’t worry about the Thanksgiving. These are tough people.” pic.twitter.com/GOxfL2nyu4 — Josh Campbell (@joshscampbell) November 20, 2018

He doesn't care. This is the first time he thought about it, and he wasn't even really thinking about it. Immediately he started speaking for them, with more than a little of the Many People Are Saying to it. "They are so proud to be representing our country on the border," he declared, and surely some are. But he doesn't know this from talking to them, because Trump has refused to go visit them. He sent Defense Secretary James Mattis instead.

In fact, in a break with all of his modern predecessors, he has refused to visit any troops in combat zones:

“Trump has spoken privately about his fears over risks to his own life...

‘He’s never been interested in going,’ the official said of Trump visiting troops in a combat zone... ‘He’s afraid of those situations. He’s afraid people want to kill him.’” https://t.co/ed4HGYqRRn — Dan Eggen (@DanEggenWPost) November 20, 2018

Faced with criticism over that, Trump declared Tuesday he would be visiting a combat zone. But he didn't specify which, and as we know, the president's word ain't exactly bond. This is the guy who banged on about how bad the Department of Veterans Affairs was during the campaign—and then handed over shadow management of the agency to three guys at Mar-a-Lago, none of whom served in the military or government and only one of whom has any kind of medical background. Trump refused to visit a 100-year World War I memorial in Paris due to rain this month—then screamed at his aides for not telling him it'd be a bad look when the other western leaders went without him.





He even attacked U.S. Admiral Bill McRaven—a decorated special ops commander who led the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, and who is battling leukemia—this week after McRaven dared criticize him. Trump slammed McRaven for not getting the Qaeda leader sooner, one from his Macho Archive that also includes how he would have run in and engaged the Parkland mass shooter. Pay no attention to the fact he's also afraid to visit troops in war zones. The attacks on McRaven are the latest in a long line of Trumpian vitriol aimed at combat veterans and their families, including a Gold Star family, but most infamously John McCain. Trump sneered at McCain for getting captured in Vietnam—a conflict Trump avoided by securing five draft deferments. He later referred to his quest to avoid sexually transmitted diseases in 1970s New York as his "personal Vietnam."

The president's concern for veterans and their families is contingent on whether they praise or criticize him. And he doesn't care about the people he sent to the border because, by and large, he doesn't care about anyone who doesn't share his last name. Over the coming weeks, one suspects even that will be tested. He doesn't care that they're away from their families for Thanksgiving, sitting in the desert so he could make a big, strong political statement. He doesn't care that he's steadily dragging the United States republic towards authoritarianism, deploying the military on U.S. soil for partisan politics. He only cares about getting through another day by the seat of his pants, lying through his teeth and snarling at anyone who points out how manifestly unfit for the job he is.



Support for this president is sinking among active-duty troops, but they cannot, by policy, make their voices heard. It is critical for those familiar with their experiences, like Admiral McRaven, to use theirs. We've concerned ourselves here with the thousands of troops who will spend Thanksgiving at the border, but there are thousands more who will spend it in the far reaches of Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan. In the latter case, this is the 17th consecutive Thanksgiving that American service members will be there.

The reasons why they're still there aren't much better-defined anymore than those we've heard for sending troops to our southern border. We ought to be thankful for the one percent of Americans who fight these fights for all of us, and spend all-American holidays away from home—even if we can't explain to them why they're there, or why every president before this one has always had American troops in some combat zone to visit.

WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE IS ALREADY IMPEACHABLE BY ANY REASONABLE STANDARD

All of these things hit between three and five o'clock Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday.

Taking the side of a foreign despot who murdered and dismembered an American resident journalist, a clearly impeachable offense, and another story about the deeply corrupt hack whom you intend to use to obstruct justice in the biggest way possible. You have to admit, that's a helluva two hours right there. From the Times:



President Trump told the White House counsel in the spring that he wanted to order the Justice Department to prosecute two of his political adversaries: his 2016 challenger, Hillary Clinton, and the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, according to two people familiar with the conversation.



The lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, rebuffed the president, saying that he had no authority to order a prosecution. Mr. McGahn said that while he could request an investigation, that too could prompt accusations of abuse of power. To underscore his point, Mr. McGahn had White House lawyers write a memo for Mr. Trump warning that if he asked law enforcement to investigate his rivals, he could face a range of consequences, including possible impeachment.



The encounter was one of the most blatant examples yet of how Mr. Trump views the typically independent Justice Department as a tool to be wielded against his political enemies. It took on additional significance in recent weeks when Mr. McGahn left the White House and Mr. Trump appointed a relatively inexperienced political loyalist, Matthew G. Whitaker, as the acting attorney general.



Here's the thing. If we're still following the Constitution, as soon as the president* finished asking the question, he was guilty of a high crime and liable to impeachment and removal from office. It doesn't matter that it never happened, or that McGahn talked him out of it. Given his position, the very suggestion by the president* that the Justice Department behave as his personal Praetorian Guard is an obstruction of justice and an abuse of power. McGahn should've walked that conversation over to Robert Mueller's place as soon as he left the Oval Office. However, he didn't, and the Times leaves us with this little land mine deep in the story.





It is unclear whether Mr. Trump read Mr. McGahn’s memo or whether he pursued the prosecutions further.

It is? We're "unclear" whether the president* actually acted on this notion, compounding his felonies, and we're "unclear" whether investigations of Clinton and Comey might be underway right now. That's one fcklord of a cliffhanger right there, NYT.

Perhaps more than any president since Richard M. Nixon, Mr. Trump has been accused of trying to exploit his authority over law enforcement. Witnesses have told the special counsel’s investigators about how Mr. Trump tried to end an investigation into an aide, install loyalists to oversee the inquiry into his campaign and fire Mr. Mueller.

If everybody does his or her job the right way, they're going to have to bring the copies of the indictments up the Potomac by barge.

Meanwhile, the White House continues to insist that the Mueller investigation should be put into the grasping hands of Matt Whitaker who, as an old cop reporter once put it to me, apparently wears rubber pockets so he can steal soup. He's already been tied to a scam that cheated veterans, and to a sham company that promised to patent time travel, as well as toilets for men with big dicks. Now, the Washington Post tells us that Whitaker's rise to legal prominence was fueled by dark money that he didn't even have to con out of people.

Whitaker’s 2017 pay from the charity—more than $500,000 for the first nine months, or half the charity’s receipts for the year, according to tax filings — and the group’s earlier, dormant incarnation have not been previously reported by media. Whitaker did not respond to requests for interviews. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec declined to answer detailed questions about his involvement in FACT, referring a reporter to the charity. A FACT spokesman who provided a statement on the condition that his name not be used declined to disclose the source of its funding. “Like nearly all non-profit organizations — including those with similarly stated missions—FACT does not and is not required to release its donor information,” the statement said. “This protects free speech rights of all of these groups’ supporters as outlined in the First Amendment.”

(An aside: remember the whole IRS nothingburger? The performance outrage by conservative activists who claimed that the jackbooted IRS was treading heavily on their First Amendment right to lie people out of their money? This is what it all was about—a protection racket for phony "charity" and "public service" organizations that really engage in dark-money political activism.)

Whitaker was a natural for this kind of thing.

When the nonprofit was launched in 2012, Whitaker was a former U.S. attorney with a modest legal practice in Iowa that paid him $79,000 that year, according to a later disclosure he filed for a failed Senate bid. He also had several local side businesses, including a day-care center and a trailer manufacturer.

Then, along came the Wingnut Welfare Fairy to touch him with her wand.

The Post determined from other tax filings that the money came from DonorsTrust, a large nonprofit organization that wealthy contributors have used to anonymously give millions to conservative nonprofits in recent years. The president of DonorsTrust, Lawson Bader, declined to identify the source of the funding contributed to FACT through his organization. FACT launched its advocacy efforts shortly after Whitaker took over, describing itself in a news release as a “new watchdog group.” On its website and in tax filings in 2014, FACT said that its mission was “to educate the public about unethical conduct on the part of public officials by publicizing these actions through media outlets throughout the country” and through its own website. The new three-member board now comprised Whitaker, Whitaker’s former law partner and a conservative activist, Neil Corkery, who is involved in operating or funding multiple conservative charities. Whitaker’s former partner, William Gustoff, did not return calls for comment. Corkery did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.



And thank you once again, Justice Anthony Kennedy.

The IRS prohibits charities from directly or indirectly participating in political campaigns, for or against candidates. The prohibition is rarely enforced.

Ah, well.

Again, all of this came to light in one two-hour period on one Tuesday of a holiday week. A corrupt president*, already impeachable by any reasonable standard, simultaneously tries to put a bobo in at the Department of Justice and gives us a "maybe yes, maybe no" on the atrocity murder of a journalist, a crime very likely committed at the order of a barbaric foreign satrap with whom the president* has god alone knows how many business ties. Two hours on a Tuesday. So much is falling down.

NAVY SEAL WHO LED THE BIN LADEN RAID? BAD. SAUDIS WHO MURDERED A U.S.-RESIDENT JOURNALIST? A-OK!

I see the latest issue of Highlights For Morons is out from the White House press office. The main feature in this issue concerns the murder and butchering of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. This is the official statement from the Office of the President* of the United States. It says so right at the top, so you won't confuse it with your fourth grader's history homework. We quote it in full.



America First!

The world is a very dangerous place!

The country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq's fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, "Death to America!" and "Death to Israel!" Iran is considered "the world's leading sponsor of terror."

On the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.

After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries - and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!



The crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.

Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an "enemy of the state" and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that -- this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!

That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!





I understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction - and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels -- so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!

What's your favorite sub-primate grunt that ends in an exclamation point? I'll go with, "Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event—maybe he did and maybe he didn't!" This man belongs in a home.

This is positively a Bat Signal to repressive regimes all over the world that it's open season on Americans, or on American residents, whom those regimes find troublesome. This especially includes journalists, which hits it a little close to home.

The CIA came as close as the CIA ever comes to anything to pinning this atrocity on Mohammad bin Salman and yet, because the CIA couldn't find that worthy's fingerprints on the bone saw, El Caudillo del Mar-A-Lago decided that the case against the Saudi crown prince was still as amorphous as ever. (For me, until MBS is hauled into a federal court in this country to reckon with his alleged butchery, Saudi Arabia doesn't get another dime of American money, and we're freezing every dime of their assets in this country. This is why I do not work for the State Department.) That's not even to mention that the president* very likely is in violation of his oath of office (again) by doing private business with these oligarchical hyenas while still living in government housing.



In the last week, he has attacked a heroic U.S. admiral who commanded the raid that rid the world of Osama bin Laden, and he did so while William McRaven is fighting leukemia. He did so because McRaven was mean to him. Now, he's letting MBS off the hook, and putting American lives at risk all over the globe, because the Saudis kiss his ass and throw some business his way. And 30 percent of our fellow citizens are fine with this. Elijah Cummings can't get that subpoena power soon enough.

THAT FEELING WHEN YOU'RE TOO RACIST FOR WALMART

Here's a little something for you to roll around in your head for a while: the Walmart Corporation has decided that Cindy Hyde-Smith, the incumbent Republican U.S. Senator from Mississippi currently in a runoff with Democratic candidate Mike Espy, is by word and deed too racist for Walmart to support...in Mississippi.



It seems that, two weeks after Hyde-Smith made her infamous comment about a "public hanging," Walmart made a $2,000 contribution to her campaign. Subsequently, she was caught on video urging the suppression of votes from Mississippians she finds inconvenient, and she was revealed to have accepted a $2,700 donation from a noted white-supremacist loon named Peter Sieve.

All in all, too much for the good folks from Bentonville. From NBC News:

The retail giant announced its decision to withdraw its support from Hyde-Smith in response to actress Debra Messing, who tweeted about the issue on Monday. "Hi Debra. Completely understand your concern. Sen. Hyde-Smith’s recent comments clearly do not reflect the values of our company and associates. As a result, we are withdrawing our support and requesting a refund of all campaign donations," the company said in a tweet.

There is one fact that too many progressives and Democrats were late in learning: most American corporations, even the biggest ones, are essentially lazy and cowardly. They stumble into public-relations disasters and then they are easy to frighten once they're stuck there. Any organized pressure can pretty much make them do anything at that point—including looking lazy and frightened in public. Consider that Walmart's customer base in Mississippi has a very large and active minority segment without whom Walmart wouldn't make nearly as much money as it does there. So, wham-bam, the news about Walmart's donation to Hyde-Smith hits the media and, within a day, the retail behemoth cuts her loose.



There's no question that Hyde-Smith, like Trent Lott before her, has played footsie with the unreconstructed human flotsam of American apartheid. (Read Will Bunch about her background and birthplace to understand why might be.) Ever since the Republican Party took up that mantle in response to the triumphs of the Civil Rights Movement, it simply was what you did to get elected in the South. Now, though, there's a serious material risk for doing so. One private Republican poll has Espy within five points. If it's true, and I have my doubts about it, then I'm not sure how he makes up even that margin.

But the Republicans are nervous. If they lose a Senate seat in Mississippi, having lost one in Alabama last year, the inescapable conclusion will be drawn that the Dent-Atwater South has cracked entirely, and that a new order truly is coming to birth. Even if Espy only comes close, that might be enough, too.

Update (4 p.m.): If you're interested in the Mississippi race, you can catch the only debate of the runoff cycle Tuesday night. Ms. Hyde-Smith is trying to arrange that the debate take place entirely in the Phantom Zone, but it's still scheduled to stream at 8 p.m. EST. It won't be Chiefs-Rams, but you might want to tune in to see if Ms. Hyde-Smith comes out in Confederate drag.

IVANKA TRUMP IS JUST ANOTHER WANNABE AMERICAN OLIGARCH IN HER FATHER'S ORBIT

Nothing matters. It's important to remember that. If you were still under the blissful impression that people in American politics are largely acting in good faith, and are consistent in their beliefs, and have agreed on set standards for behavior in public life to which everyone will be held, your rose-tinted glasses need a new prescription. Because we've learned that yet another official in the administration of Donald Trump—a man whose most consistent campaign message was that his opponent should be thrown in prison for using a private email account to conduct government business—was using a private email account to conduct government business.



It just so happens, according to The Washington Post, to be his nepotism case of a daughter.

Ivanka Trump sent hundreds of emails last year to White House aides, Cabinet officials and her assistants using a personal account, many of them in violation of federal records rules...White House ethics officials learned of Trump’s repeated use of personal email when reviewing emails gathered last fall by five Cabinet agencies to respond to a public records lawsuit. That review revealed that throughout much of 2017, she often discussed or relayed official White House business using a private email account with a domain that she shares with her husband, Jared Kushner.

Does this seem unreal? Try her response when called on it.

Some aides were startled by the volume of Ivanka Trump’s personal emails — and taken aback by her response when questioned about the practice. She said she was not familiar with some details of the rules, according to people with knowledge of her reaction.

She's un-fucking-familiar? All we heard for a year and a half was that using private email in office was borderline treasonous. She went to her father's rallies. She was there at the Republican National Convention. There isn't a chance in hell she's unfamiliar with the perils of private email use. Dishonesty is in this family's blood. It's coursing through their veins. It's worth noting here that Ivanka is not just The First Daughter—she's a senior adviser to the president. She seems to assume whichever role is more convenient for each media report.



You can rest assured, though, that there will be no repercussions for this. Hypocrisy is dead. You can tell because Ivanka Trump is at least the seventh (7th) Trump administration official to get caught using private email for government business.

Members of the Trump administration who have used personal email to conduct official business:

1) Ivanka Trump

2) Jared Kushner

3) Steve Bannon

4) Stephen Miller

5) Reince Priebus

6) Gary Cohn



The shameless hypocrisy of these people never ceases to amaze me. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) November 20, 2018

Here's a secret: nobody ever cared about Hillary Clinton's email protocol. Nobody. It was an election stunt in the vein of The Ebola Panic (2014) and The Caravan (2018). It was pure rhetoric. The president doesn't use email because, like a huge swathe of our elected officials in this digital age, he has basically no computing knowledge. He does use a phone, though, which it turned out was unsecured and probably an easy target for Chinese government hackers. Trump was told of the vulnerabilities, but insisted on this setup because anything else would be too inconvenient—literally the exact excuse Hillary Clinton used.

Oh, you're a transparency buff, and your beef is that Clinton failed to turn over all her emails to be incorporated in government records?

Both [Ivanka] Trump and Clinton relied on their personal attorneys to review their private emails and determine which messages should be retained as government records.

All that Ivanka and Jared are missing is their own private server in a Chappaqua basement.





Getty Images Chris Kleponis

Again: none of these people actually care about email or security protocol. It's just a cudgel to be used against political opponents. These are the people who slammed Clinton's emails on the basis she mishandled classified information—an unsettled claim—and then made a mockery of the security-clearance system, shoveling classified information towards people who failed to clear FBI background checks. They don't care.

Still, the Ivanka case is worth lingering on. The New York Times hints at why:

Current and former White House officials have said it was characteristic of a repeated blurring of the lines between her government work and other aspects of her life, which used to include her namesake licensing and apparel businesses.

And here's where we really get into it. Like her father and everyone else who comes greasing into his orbit, Ivanka Trump has seen enormous personal financial benefits to serving in public office. This is not a debatable point, even after her fashion brand went under.

Ivanka made $3.9 million from the family's DC hotel in 2017 -- the hotel that is supposed to remit profits to the Treasury, hosts foreign diplomats, and which is the target of lawsuits alleging POTUS is violating emoluments provisions of the Constitution https://t.co/gR0sYIxpMH — Tim O'Brien (@TimOBrien) November 20, 2018



Remember when the president pretended to divest from his businesses, holding a press conference with a pile of Definitely Not Empty manila folders before passing control to his sons, who quickly admitted they'd be updating him regularly on how it was all going? Remember when his hotel became the shining beacon at the center of the new swamp, a place for foreign dignitaries to curry favor with the President of the United States by putting money in his pocket? And remember when Ivanka applied for a bunch of trademarks in China and was granted them shortly before her father embarked on a campaign to save a Chinese company? You might be a bit confused because Ivanka's company was also granted 16 new patents in China just this month.

It's not like all this isn't without consequences. Why, we are forced to ask, is Trump taking the word of Saudis in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul, when the CIA found the hit order came from Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman? Is it because the Saudis are putting money in his pocket? What is Jared Kushner's relationship with the crown prince? What is informing the president's reliable friendliness towards Russia? Why, throughout all this, does he refuse to release his tax returns? What would they reveal? All of this is evidence of why conflicts-of-interest matter for public officials in a functioning democracy.

No, Ivanka Trump is merely another would-be American oligarch in her father's sordid orbit. It's now increasingly clear that when Donald Trump improbably won the presidency, a great many people took it as a green light to smash the glass and grab everything you can. That's how you get the various Cabinet officials who are tied to investment schemes and who stand accused of stealing more than $120 million from their business partners. It's how you get many of the same folks spending millions in taxpayer cash on private jet flights, and operating as an arm of the industries they're purportedly supposed to regulate. It's a Great American Heist, and everybody's trying to secure their share of the spoils. Will they make off with the American republic while they're at it?

IF AN ELECTION WAS STOLEN, SAY IT WAS STOLEN

In our old feature, What Are The Gobshites Saying These Days?, we used to do a semi-regular weekly survey of the state of Our National Dialogue based on what went down on The Sunday Showz, those still-ambulatory broadcasting dinosaurs still considered newsworthy within the Beltway and dedicated to Reasonable People Disagreeing Reasonably while the world burns down around them, and also dedicated to keeping various Capitol Hill doughnut shops open.



We placed this feature in the storeroom of the shebeen because, frankly, we got bored with it, and it was too much work keeping up with what the gobshites were saying in the age of Trump. But we're reviving it just this once because of this interesting moment that occurred on Meet The Press between Chuck Todd and the recently re-elected Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Under discussion was the manner in which Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp used the power of his office to help him finagle his way to the governorship over Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams.

Want unlimited access to Charlie? Join the fight against stupid HERE

Senator Brown recently decided to point out the elephant in the room.

TODD: Let me start with you were out this week, talking about another race in 2018. And it was in Georgia and Stacey Abrams. It was before she had acknowledged her defeat. She has now admitted defeat, didn't call it a concession. But I want to ask you about something you said this week about Georgia. Let me play it.

SEN. SHERROD BROWN: If Stacey Abrams doesn't win in Georgia, they stole it. It's clear. It's clear. And I would say, I say that publicly. It's clear.

TODD: Strong language to throw that out there. You believe, today, that this is a stolen race, that basically, Brian Kemp is, is somebody who's illegally governor right -- or governor-elect of Georgia.

It is here where Sunday Showz protocol demands that the politician cavil, hedge, or otherwise walk his argument back over his own feet. However, Senator Brown wasn't playing that.

Getty Images Win McNamee



BROWN: Well, I think you look at the lead-up to this election as secretary of state -- and I was the secretary of state in Ohio 30 years ago. I know what you do, as secretary of state. You encourage people to vote. You don't purge millions of voters. You don't close down polling places in rural areas where voters have difficulty getting to the polls, which were mostly low-income areas. You don't do what Republicans are doing all over the country.

And you've seen it, Chuck. You've seen the kind of voter suppression that, all over this country. And you end with the secretary of state of Georgia should have recused himself from running that election, as Jimmy -- as former -- Georgia resident, former-President Jimmy Carter said he should. And clearly, he did everything he could to put his thumb on the scale and won that election, quote unquote, "won" that election by only about a point.

Chuck Todd was appropriately dismayed. But Senator Brown wasn't playing that, either.

TODD: I guess I would ask this. Couldn't you bring up all of those, all of those issues, lay all of that out, without using the word, stolen? And I throw that out there, because we have enough distrust in our institutions as it is...Does that add to it?

Getty Images NBC NewsWire

BROWN: Okay, Chuck. Don't do the false equivalency of, of, of, the, you know, the lack of respect in institutions. I mean, we have a president that attacks your profession day after day after day. You, if you saw the earlier part of my election-night speech, you would've heard me thank the media. And you would've seen hundreds of people in Ohio, on the Democratic -- at this election-night gathering, turn around and clap for the media. We see a president that goes after the courts, that goes after the judicial system, a president that says, as the votes were counted, that something's been wrong with the elections. He criticizes the elections that way. So don't play this false equivalency. Because a former secretary of state, like me, said that about this election, which clearly is an effort to suppress the vote, not of people that look like you and me, Chuck--





CHUCK TODD: Right.

BROWN: --but people of color especially. And it's happened. Now spend your air time-- I don't mean to lecture--

[Ed. Note: Feel free to lecture, senator. I'm just making some more popcorn over here.]

TODD: No, no, no, I, look --

BROWN: -- but spend your airtime critical of those people who are trying to suppress the vote.

This is not to single out Chuck Todd. His interplay with Brown was merely the most obvious public manifestation of dismay over the senator's quite accurate assessment of what happened in Georgia. More than a few pearls were clutched over Brown's choice of language.

Rick Hasen, the election-law guru, writing in Slate, made the same argument at greater length. I confess I don't follow Hasen's line of thought at all. He seems to be arguing that calling the election in Georgia "stolen," as Brown clearly did, undermines the fight against suppressing the vote, as Kemp clearly did. I'm unclear how this is the case.

First, rhetoric about stolen elections feeds a growing cycle of mistrust and delegitimization of the election process, an attack pushed by President Donald Trump and other Republicans who have been yelling “voter fraud” every time they are behind in the count. I’ve already set out my fear that Trump could refuse to concede the 2020 presidential election if he is ahead in the count on election night and then ballot counts inevitably shift toward Democrats as the counting continues. A democratic polity depends on losers accepting election results, even if the election was not conducted perfectly. I would hold “stolen” election rhetoric for conduct even more outrageous than Kemp’s decisions, which, while odious, either have not been found to be illegal or that courts allowed to remain in place for this election.



I mean, holy hell. Because Kemp used the power of the office he held to help himself gain the office to which he was aspiring, this means that he could not be said to have "stolen" the election, even as a shorthand designation for his clearly corrupt conduct? If a state legislature in, say, Nebraska, were to use its eminent domain power to appropriate a farmer's land in order to help a foreign corporation build, say, an oil-sands pipeline, is it really not permissible for people to say that the legislature "stole" the farmer's land, even though it used its power corruptly to benefit a private interest? Is there an exemption by which theft is not theft if it is done under the color of law? A lot of local sheriffs who got rich behind civil forfeiture laws are going to be happy to hear that.

Getty Images Kevin C. Cox

And as for the growing cycle of distrust and delegitimization, that's already been underway for some time, as Rick Hasen's previous work has demonstrated. In our current historical moment, it began with the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore. Do the people making the tone-police argument on this issue really believe that the Georgia voters who showed up at their polling place only to find that it had been closed, and who then went out of their way to the nearest one only to find that they couldn't vote because the hyphen in their last name really was a dash, wouldn't say their votes were "stolen," and that, therefore, the election was, too? They don't need Sherrod Brown to believe that, I assure you.

Hasen also seems to misunderstand the nature of El Caudillo Del Mar-A-Lago, too. If the Democratic Party tries to temper its rhetoric based on whatever the most recent egregious lie has emerged from the presidential* gob, the Democratic Party is going to have a nervous breakdown. The president, because he is both corrupt and something of a dunce, will say what he's going to say regardless of how temperate the Democratic response is. Sometimes, blunt instruments have to be met with blunt instruments.

Much of the most loyal portions of the Democratic Party's political base already believe from their own experience, and not because of anything Sherrod Brown and Stacey Abrams have said, that their elections are being stolen out from under them. It's up to the opposition to speak for those whose right to choose their own leaders was, yes, stolen from them through bureaucratic legerdemain and malfeasance in office. Which is a long way around to point out that the run-off election for Secretary of State in Georgia is the most important election of many lifetimes.

THE CHICKENPOX VACCINE IS SAFE. AVOIDING IT IS NOT. THERE IS NO ARGUMENT. THESE ARE FACTS.

Some kids in North Carolina didn't get vaccinated, so some kids in North Carolina got chickenpox. That's the takeaway from a Washington Post report examining the latest infectious disease outbreak in an anti-vax hotbed—this one, thankfully, outside the usual confines of California. It's about time we ramped up the geographic diversity, and it seems they've got a bit of a problem at the Asheville Waldorf School:



Chickenpox has taken hold of a school in North Carolina where many families claim religious exemption from vaccines. Cases of chickenpox have been multiplying at the Asheville Waldorf School, which serves children from nursery school to sixth grade in Asheville, N.C. About a dozen infections grew to 28 at the beginning of the month. By Friday, there were 36, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported.

The outbreak ranks as the state’s worst since the chickenpox vaccine became available more than 20 years ago. Since then, the two-dose course has succeeded in limiting the highly contagious disease that once affected 90 percent of Americans — a public health breakthrough.

There is something quintessentially American about being able to get a "religious exemption" from something that exhaustive scientific study indicates will keep your child healthier. (Also, it's not just your kid: some people cannot get vaccinated, and depend on so-called herd immunity—where a big enough percentage of the community is vaccinated that it's difficult to transmit disease—to avoid illness.) Apparently, the percentage of kids under two who go unvaccinated in this country has quadrupled since 2001, because yeah, your doctor says they're safe, but did you read that email with the subject "FW:FW:FW:FW:FW: vaccine DEATH??"

Getty Images Digital First Media/Orange Count

As the Post went on to spell out, there is absolutely no question—among people who actually know about these things—whether the chickenpox vaccine is safe and effective:



That was before a two-dose vaccination program was introduced in the United States in 1995. The virus used to crop up in about 4 million cases annually in the United States, causing more than 10,000 hospitalizations and between 100 and 150 deaths...

The vaccine, which the CDC says is about 90 percent effective, hasn’t eliminated the varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox. But since the regimen became commercially available, it has reduced the number of cases, as well as their severity. A 14-year prospective study published in Pediatrics in 2013 found that the incidence of infection was nine- to 10-times lower than in the pre-vaccine era.

None of that's enough to stop an American with the courage of their own boneheaded convictions, however. In recent years, we've seen measles (!) outbreaks in New Jersey, Minnesota, and California. In 2014, the CDC reports there were 23 measles outbreaks in the United States. The majority of people who got it were unvaccinated.

While a lot of the anti-science in America is concentrated on the right—where the scientific consensus that, say, climate change is real and man-made is often dismissed out of hand—anti-vax is closer to equal-opportunity insanity. Plenty of those refusing to follow doctors' advice out in California are card-carrying liberal types, though only the Republican Party was home to two (2) presidential candidates last time around who raised doubts about the safety of vaccines. One, of course, is now the president:

Another was, incredibly, a world-renowned neurosurgeon. Perhaps Ben Carson is proof that experts, too, can have wild ideas—or can disregard the work of experts. Carson, for instance, also disregards the work of Egyptologists to claim the Pyramids at Giza were built by the biblical Joseph in order to store grain. But claims about vaccines—and climate change—are built on expert consensus, in which claims become the prevailing view of the wider scientific community only after extensive testing and debate. It's not just some guy spouting off on a street corner—or, you know, the presidential debate stage.



There's a current of anti-intellectualism in American life, where expertise is conflated with elitism—and experts are dismissed as arrogant know-it-alls in favor of "common sense" or "all-natural" solutions. Common sense isn't common. Listen to your doctor.

THIRD-RATE GRIFTING IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY IN TRUMP'S AMERICA

No organization is doing a better job keeping corporate predation in the news than is ProPublica in its collaboration with local newspapers on the ground. It has come up with another outstanding bit of gumshoeing on that beat with its latest story from West Virginia. Residents of that state were promised royalty checks from various extraction industries if they allowed those entities to drill on their land. Do you know what's coming? Of course, you do.



EQT began deducting for what it said was the cost of transporting the gas, for processing the gas and even for state taxes. All told, since November 2016, the Richardses calculated they were missing about $235,000 in royalties.



The Richardses had looked closely at their lease agreements. The agreements stated that EQT would give them 12.5 percent of the revenue generated from the wells. They didn’t say anything about allowing deductions. So the Richardses went to court, filing a federal suit against the company in February 2017.



“I only want the royalty that is due us, according to our lease,” Mary Richards told a jury in Clarksburg this September.



Arnold and Mary Richards are the latest among thousands of West Virginians who have watched the state’s natural gas producers whittle away at royalties promised to them, according to a review of court records by the Charleston Gazette-Mail and ProPublica.

We elected a third-rate chiseler to be president*, so it should be no surprise that, within the corporate ethos in which he'd swum for decades, third-rate chiseling would be the order of the day. It is certainly a sight to behold when a multimillion corporation behaves like a guy who knocks on your door to sell you aluminum siding made out of plywood.

While the state Legislature and courts have both tried to ensure that residents are getting their fair share, gas companies have simply shifted their tactics.



In 1982, the Legislature banned leases that limited payments to just a few hundred dollars a year. The bill declared an end to the “continued exploitation of the natural resources of this state in exchange for such wholly inadequate compensation.”



Twenty years later, residents filed a series of suits alleging they were still being shortchanged. The lawsuits prompted a series of settlements and a $400 million verdict in 2007.



Yet residents say these practices haven’t ended. A class-action lawsuit, filed in 2013 on behalf of more than 10,000 individuals and companies that own gas, is set to go to trial in two weeks. It alleges that EQT—the state’s second-largest producer—continues to take improper deductions from royalties.

Want unlimited access to Charlie? Join the fight against stupid HERE



It is here where we point out (again) that unless these companies are fined so heavily that they can barely survive, or until brigades of corporate officers are introduced to federal institutional dining, none of this ever changes. This company got hit with a $400 million verdict 11 years ago, and it's back doing the same damn thing.

West Virginia’s natural gas industry has flourished, with production roughly tripling in the past five years. State leaders portray the industry as the heart of a strong future economy, perhaps to replace the declining coal business.



But there are growing indications that natural gas is taking West Virginia down the same path as coal, including a long and continuing battle over how the profits are divvied up among residents and out-of-state companies that are extracting natural resources from the land. And EQT is now suing to gut the 1982 royalty law that was meant to give gas owners a larger piece of the industry pie.

I'm shocked.

For Arnold Richards, the reason to fight is clear: “It’s not because I don’t have enough money to live on. I do,” he testified. “I really worked hard all these years to get it, not pass it on to a corporation.”



After deliberating for just a few hours, the jury ordered EQT to repay the Richardses the $192,000 in post-production costs that had been deducted from their royalty payments. U.S. District Judge Irene Keeley had already ordered the company to pay them nearly $43,000 in taxes that had been deducted, for a total of $235,000.

So there's a little justice, anyway. And I think, "I really worked hard all these years to get it, not pass it on to a corporation,” isn't a bad tax policy, either.

Ik hou erg van mooie dingen en als ik iets zie dat ik mooi vind – en ik heb de week ervoor niet een heleboel gekocht – dan vind ik het vet om dat te hebben. Op de foto draag ik mijn eigen poncho, schoenen en sjaaltje van Hermès, omdat ik de outfit eigen wilde maken. Het had iets extra Freddy’s nodig.''

''Ik vind het vet als mijn outfits op het randje van chic en belachelijk balanceren. Dat mensen denken: hè, wat heeft hij nou weer aan? – zonder dat het aanstellerig wordt. Door jarenlange ervaring vind je die balans. Maar als ik optreed, mag het wat uitbundiger. Dan sta je toch een beetje op een afstandje. De nummers die we maken bij De Jeugd zijn een allegaartje van muziekstijlen, maar bij elkaar klopt het gewoon. Dat is ook zo met mijn stijl.''

Freddy, die op Instagram wekelijks laat zien geen onverdienstelijke kok te zijn, kroop voor ons weer achter het fornuis. Wil je zien hoe je moet flamberen op z'n Vjeze Furs? Bekijk hieronder de video:

''Een goed kledingstuk spreekt voor zich, daar moeten niet te veel toeters en bellen aan zitten. Qua kledingstijl ben ik denk ik eerder klassiek dan 'hipster' – maar dat past bij mijn functie. Voor kledinginspiratie check ik op Instagram de hashtags #sprezzatura of #flannels_and_tweed.''

''Wanneer ik ga shoppen, weet ik precies wat ik wil toevoegen aan mijn kledingkast en daar ga ik dan net zo lang naar op zoek tot ik het heb. Ik koop alleen tijdloze kledingstukken die ik fantastisch vind. Goede kleding wordt mooier met de jaren.''

''Het Ralph Lauren-jasje dat ik aan heb in de shoot, is een van mijn favoriete jasjes. Ik kocht het toen ik nog studeerde. Ik had het al vaak in de winkel zien hangen, maar kon het niet betalen. Toen het wegging voor de helft van de helft van de helft, heb ik mijn slag geslagen. De tweed is prachtig, maar het jasje zit bovenal heerlijk.''

''Mijn vriendin en ik bedenken in de avond wat ik de dag erna zal aantrekken, omdat we het leuk vinden om het over kleding te hebben. We zijn er veel mee bezig. Mijn stijl beschrijf ik als eclectisch. Die is heel breed en eigenlijk niet te definiëren. Het liefst draag ik altijd pakken, maar ik kleed me ook sportief. Een outfit die ik op dit moment veel draag, is een chique trainingsbroek met een overhemd, jasje en loafers.''

''Het pak dat ik op de cover draag, vind ik echt heel vet. Voordat ik dat pak aan kreeg, had ik een wat stoerdere outfit aangepast. Maar toen mij dat double-breasted pak van Paul Smith werd overhandigd, voelde dat als een magisch moment.''

''Op het podium zijn mijn outfits wat meer in your face. Ik hou van kleuren, patronen en vormen en daar experimenteer ik veel mee. Een paar maanden geleden heb ik in Suriname een blauwe smoking op maat laten maken, waarvan de revers gemaakt zijn van een stof met Afrikaanse print. Die smoking draag ik alleen bij speciale gelegenheden; ik had hem voor het eerst aan toen ik met het Metropole Orkest optrad in Carré – dat was tevens de eerste keer dat ik in Carré stond. En ik had hem aan bij de Edisons.''

''In mijn vrije tijd is mijn stijl een mix van casual en classy. Ik draag graag jeans en gympen met een mooie jas erover. Toen ik naar Nederland verhuisde, moest ik al snel shoppen; winterkleding had ik uit Suriname niet bij me, maar dat vond ik helemaal niet erg. Nu koop ik iedere winter twee mooie jassen.''

DIT GEBEURT ER ALS JE 'S LANDS COOLSTE JAZZMUZIKANT DRONKEN VOERT (EN FILMT!)

In 2008 werd stijlicoon Benjamin Herman (50) bekroond tot Best Geklede Man van Nederland. En nu, tien jaar later, neemt deze jazzmuzikant plaats aan de bar van Rosalia's Menagerie, waar Esquires Gandor Bronkhorst een intiem gesprek met hem voert onder het genot van een kopstootje.



In Esquires nieuwe rubriek Komt een man in de bar nodigt Gandor spraakmakende en stijlvolle gasten uit om aan zijn bar een kopstoot (of drie) te drinken. De soorten jenever en bier worden zorgvuldig uitgezocht op basis van het karakter van de mannen.

Zo krijgt saxofonist en levensgenieter Benjamin Herman de Bols Barrel Aged Genever naar zich toe geschoven vanwege het complexe en ontembare karakter van de drank.

Esquire

Naast Best Geklede Man in 2008 won de muzikant drie keer een Edison award voor beste jazz-album. Één hiervan won hij ook met New Cool Collective. Benjamin is frontman van deze 8-koppige jazzformatie, waarin hij speelt met Rory Ronde, Joost Kroon, Frank van Dok, Jos de Haas, Willem Friede, Leslie Lopez en David Rockefeller.

'Ik speel ook wel eens een dag geen saxofoon, maar daar baal ik dan echt van.'

Sinds Benjamin op zijn twaalfde voor het eerst een saxofoon in handen kreeg, speelt hij dagelijks. Op zijn dertiende trad hij al op. Niet veel later, op zijn twintigste, speelde hij wereldwijd met verschillende groepen en begon hij aan eigen projecten.

'Ik heb soms natuurlijk ook een dag dat ik geen saxofoon speel, maar dat is dan bijvoorbeeld op vakantie en daar kan ik dan echt wel van balen', vertelt Benjamin.

Esquire

Naast de werkethiek van Benjamin Herman vliegen er ook anekdotes over zijn liefdesleven, alcoholgebruik en passie voor stijl over de bar. Zo komen we erachter dat stijl heel belangrijk is voor Benjamin, hij zichzelf een waardeloze vrijgezel vindt en een echte gentleman is.

'Na een avond optreden en wat drankjes achteraf, word ik soms krakkemikkig wakker. Maar als ik me dan goed kleed, mijn stropdas omdoe en gepoetste schoenen draag, voel ik me weer oké.'

ANTI-KATER TIPS: ZO OVERLEEF JIJ DE ZWARE OCHTENDEN

Het weekend is er om je te ontspannen en daar hoort zo nu en dan ook een drankje bij. Soms is het iets meer dan 'een drankje' en eindig je de volgende dag met een flinke kater in je bed, terwijl de schoonfamilie in de middag langskomt.

Een kater is helaas nooit een vrijbrief van je verplichtingen, dus ook niet van je schoonmoeder. We hebben een paar tips op een rijtje gezet om je te helpen met je kater:



Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

1 - WEL: de kater uit je lichaam slapen

Geduld is een schone zaak, ook met je kater. Probeer zo lang mogelijk te slapen, ondanks dat jouw ritme er misschien voor zorgt dat je om acht uur weer wakker bent.

Drink even een glas water en duik je bed weer in: je lichaam heeft tijd nodig om zich te herstellen.

2 - NIET: alcohol drinken om de kater tegen te gaan

Het probleem oplossen met de oorzaak... Zo werkt het natuurlijk niet. Je verhelpt je kater er namelijk niet mee, je stelt het alleen een beetje uit.

En dan moet je ook nog eens door alle pijn en moeite om dat biertje met frisse tegenzin weg te krijgen. Spaar jezelf de lijdensweg.

3 - WEL: water drinken

Eén ding dat je nooit moet vergeten tijdens je kater is hydrateren. Misschien een betere tip: je kunt tijdens het feestje óók gewoon een watertje tussendoor drinken.

We begrijpen dat op de avond zelf een kopstootje een stuk lekkerder is, dus waarschijnlijk begin jij in de ochtend pas met water. Geen zorgen, want het helpt nog steeds. Alcohol heeft namelijk een dehydraterend effect, vandaar ook die nadorst.

4 - NIET: sportdranken drinken

Sportdranken zijn er om energie te geven tijdens het sporten, niet om jouw kater te genezen. Dat zullen ze dus ook niet doen.

Ga terug naar tip 3.

5 - WEL: sporten

Het is misschien niet je eerste idee wanneer je wakker wordt met een bonkend hoofd een uitgedroogde mond, maar toch zul je je er beter door voelen. Tijdens het sporten worden endorfines geproduceerd en van dit stofje word je niet alleen blij, het onderdrukt ook je pijn.

Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

Waarschijnlijk heb je in de avond nog wat goede moves op de dansvloer laten zien, dus je kan last hebben van spierpijn. Begin rustig met je workout en kijk hoe ver je komt.

6 - NIET: vet voedsel eten

Voordat je aan je avond begint is het verstandig om een goede bodem te leggen. De dag daarna hoeft dat niet. Je hebt echter wel voeding nodig om de kater iets dragelijker te maken, maar zorg ervoor dat dit niet te vet is.

In plaats van dat je de dag begint met de ovenpizza die nog in je diepvries ligt, kun je beter een eitje met avocado bakken!

7 - WEL: pijnstillers in de ochtend

Een ouderwetse paracetamol of ibuprofen in de ochtend. Let op: in de ochtend! Voordat je beschonken je bed in duikt heeft het nog geen zin om dit als preventieve medicatie te nemen. Sterker nog, het is extra slecht voor je om in de avond al pijnstillers te nemen. Jouw lever heeft het namelijk al druk genoeg met die kopstootjes die jij naar binnen hebt gegoten, dus die geneesmiddelen moeten even wachten.



8 - NIET: anti-kater pillen nemen

We geloven wel in een onschuldige paracetamol, maar niet in magische anti-kater pilletjes. Deze pillen kosten handen vol geld en ze beloven je het onmogelijke.

Er bestaat geen magisch medicijn tegen de pijntjes van een kater, dus trap daar maar niet in. We verwijzen je weer door naar tip 1, 3 en 5.

DE 5 SLAPSTE SMOESJES OM WEER NIET TE GAAN SPORTEN

Iedereen heeft wel een smoes om vooral niet te gaan sporten. Waarom? Sporten is werk. Het vergt tijd en moeite, en vooral veel geduld voor je de eerste resultaten ziet.

Geen wonder dat mensen liever niet sporten. Het probleem is alleen dat sporten een belangrijk onderdeel van een gezonde lifestyle is. Hieronder een lijst van de meest voorkomende excuses… en waarom ze nergens op slaan.

Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

1. Ik heb niet genoeg tijd

Dit is het meest voorkomende excuus dat mensen gebruiken om niet te gaan sporten. De reden hiervan is dat iedereen dit excuus gebruikt, dus lijkt het legitiem. Als iedereen te druk is om te sporten, waarom jij dan niet?

Het probleem is dat de meeste mensen een vreselijk voedingspatroon hebben, dus de meute volgen werkt niet bepaald in je voordeel. Als je echt het gevoel hebt dat je niet genoeg tijd hebt , ga dan eens na hoeveel uur per dag je tv kijkt of op tech interwebz rondhangt. Als je per dag een half uur van die tijd gebruikt om te sporten, ben je al enorm goed op weg.

2. Sporten is te duur

Een ander veelvoorkomend excuus waarom mensen niet gaan sporten, is dat het te duur is. Sportschoolabonnementen kosten geld en tools voor thuis zijn ook vrij prijzig – en nemen redelijk wat ruimte in beslag. Deze twee excuses zijn op zich wel geldig. Tot op zekere hoogte.

Als je een full-body workout wil, kan een sportschool helpen. Maar voor een goede cardiosessie heb je niets dan de buitenlucht en een paar sportschoenen nodig. Als het weer niet meezit, kun je altijd een paar euro uitgeven aan een springtouw. Dit is niet alleen goedkoop, maar neemt ook weinig ruimte in.

3. Je begint volgende week/maand/jaar/eeuw

Aangezien sporten heel wat werk vereist, is het geen verrassing dat het vaak wordt uitgesteld. Ga na wat je tegenhoudt om dagelijks te gaan sporten, of zelfs nu. Als je dit artikel leest, heb je waarschijnlijk wel wat vrije tijd. Staat er iets in de weg behalve uitstelgedrag?



4. Ik ben bang om het te verpesten/dat ik het niet kan

Als je niet vaak naar de sportschool gaat, is het logisch dat je enigszins onzeker bent op de vloer. Daar zijn verschillende redenen voor. Mensen die regelmatig naar de gym gaan, zien er over het algemeen goed uit. Grote kans dat je een paar spierbonken tegenkomt. Die kunnen op z'n zachtst gezegd intimiderend zijn.

Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

Het kan ook lastig zijn om met apparaten aan de slag te gaan waarvan je niet weet waar ze toe dienen, of een sportschema aan te houden zonder dat je weet of je het wel goed doet. Weet: een goede sportschool heeft goede instructeurs die je dolgraag op weg helpen. Daar hebben ze voor geleerd.

Geef het een paar weken en je voelt je net zo thuis in de gym als de stamgast die er al 10 jaar lang elke dag over de vloer komt.

5. Ik ben toch al slank, dus boeiend

Veel mensen sporten niet omdat ze vinden dat ze al een prima lijf hebben. Als je van nature slank gebouwd bent en niet sport omdat je er al goed uitziet, denk hier dan eens over na: mensen die niet sporten, wat voor lichaamstype ze ook hebben, lopen alsnog gezondheidsrisico's: voornamelijk hartziektes.

Een onderzoek door dokter Gary O'Donovan van Brunel University onderzocht slanke sporters, slanke niet-sporters en sporters met obesitas. Uit de resultaten bleek dat de niet-sportende deelnemers – zowel slank als zwaarlijvig – een grotere kans op het ontwikkelen van hartziektes hebben.

Wat dit betekent? Om hartziektes en andere aandoeningen te voorkomen, is sporten ook voor slanke mensen belangrijk.

Weet je niet waar je moet beginnen? Begin eens met een rondje hardlopen. Grote kans dat je je daarna zo goed voelt, dat je lichaam en geest naar meer smachten. Zo niet: toch doen. Zo makkelijk kom je er niet vanaf.

ER JONGER UITZIEN IS MAKKELIJKER DAN JE DENKT — EN ZO DOE JE HET

We willen er allemaal in geloven dat die grijze haren iets moois zijn, maar in werkelijkheid heb je ze liever (nog) niet. Oud worden kan mooi zijn, ja, maar dat is altijd bij andere mensen. Jijzelf wil zolang mogelijk, zo jeugdig mogelijk blijven.

En dat is helemaal niet zo lastig als het lijkt. Met een paar basisaanpassingen aan je eigen lichamelijke verzorging, zie jij er zolang mogelijk, zo jeugdig mogelijk uit. Het zijn allemaal inkoppertjes, maar ze helpen wel. Hoppa.

Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

1 Let op je gewicht

Dit advies gaat beide kanten op: zorg dat je er niet te dik uitziet, maar ook niet te dun. Ga dus regelmatig naar een sportschool of doe regelmatig een andere fysieke inspanning.

En let op wat je eet, man. Die suikers en vetten maken je huid er niet beter op. Wat je wel moet doen: gevarieerd en zo gezond mogelijk eten. Vergeet daarnaast niet shitloads aan water te drinken.

2 Hou je (gezichts)haar kort

Maar ook niet te kort, uiteraard. Een kale look helpt niet wanneer mensen je leeftijd schatten.

Ook is het leuk om te kijken hoe mannelijk je wel niet bent door je gezichtshaar zo lang mogelijk te laten groeien, maar met de centimeter die je baard groeit, neemt jouw geschatte leeftijd toe. Trimmen of scheren die handel, dus.

3 Preventie is altijd beter dan oplossen

Helaas is huidtransplantatie nog geen een realistische trend, en blijft het dus het verstandigst om je eigen huis zo goed mogelijk te verzorgen. Een gezonde huid = een een jonge uitstraling.

Zorg ervoor dat je je huid regelmatig schoonmaakt en hydrateert met een goede huidcrème. Draag in de zomer zonnebrandcrème om rimpels tegen te gaan (zelfs wanneer je denkt dat het niet nodig is). Zie hier hoe je je gezicht in 5 makkelijke stappen verzorgt.

4 Verberg grijze haren

Natuurlijk ziet George Clooney er goed uit met zijn grijze haren, maar dat wil niet zeggen dat jij dat ook kan. Mocht het dus heel erg zijn, vraag jezelf af of je wellicht je haar moet verven. Tom Cruise zal 't vast ook doen.

5 Hou je tanden schoon

Hopelijk doe je dit al, maar wanneer je lacht maakt dit je jonger en opgewekter. Het is dus aan te raden om een schone glimlach te behouden. Daarnaast maken witte tanden je ook aantrekkelijker voor vrouwen, wat natuurlijk allemaal mooi meegenomen is.

TOM HARDY KOMT TERUG ALS 'DUIVEL DELANEY' IN HET TWEEDE SEIZOEN VAN TABOO

De BBC dramaserie Taboo met acteur Tom Hardy in de hoofdrol komt definitief terug voor een tweede seizoen. De serie is geschreven door de wereldberoemde schrijver Steven Knight van Peaky Blinders. Hardy speelt in de serie The Devil Delaney, een man die meerdere mensen heeft vermoord.

Uitvoerend producer Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) van de serie heeft nu bevestigd dat de BBC meer avonturen met James Delaney wil maken. Schrijver Knight vertelt aan Radio Times dat hij er vertrouwen in had dat de show nog minstens twee seizoenen ging krijgen. Jep, je hoort het goed: maar liefst twee seizoenen.

Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

“We think it has got a two and a three certainly, that’s the plan,” zegt Knight. “After that who knows? This series is eight parts – it’s a lot of time.” To be continued, dus...

BBC

Al eerder dropte Tom Hardy hints over een tweede seizoen van Taboo, maar deze zijn nu helemaal bevestigd. Ook Hardy is blij dat de BBC verder wil met het Britse drama. ''Fantastic news'', zegt de acteur.



En wat de plot betreft: James Delaney zal nieuwe plekken blijven verkennen terwijl hij zijn groep van buitenbeentjes meeneemt naar een nieuwe wereld. Hardy's personage zeilde in de finale van seizoen één weg naar de Azoren onder de Amerikaanse vlag. Knight zegt dat Delaney in een nieuwe fase terecht komt...

Voor degene die de serie nog niet hebben gezien, hebben wij de plot van het eerste seizoen even voor je samengevat: de serie speelt zich af in Londen in 1814. Het is modderig, grauw en donker.



BBC

Iedereen om Delaney heen denkt dat hij dood is, maar dan keert hij terug uit Afrika om de begrafenis van zijn overleden vader bij te wonen. Uit zijn testament wordt duidelijk dat Delaney een stuk land in Canada heeft geërfd. Een stuk land, zo blijkt, dat een fortuin waard is als de oorlog met Amerika over is. Sommige mensen zijn echter not amused dat Delaney terug is om zijn erfenis op te eisen.

Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

Dit heeft een strijd als gevolg. Delaney houdt krampachtig vast aan wat hem is toevertrouwd door zijn vader. Zijn halfzus (Oona Chaplin) en haar man voelen zich om de tuin geleid en de East India Company (de Britse Oost-Indische Compagnie) doet er alles aan om van The Devil af te komen.

BBC

Een uiterst donker en bijna spookachtig drama is het zeker. Tom Hardy is op z'n zachts gezegd een ietwat vreemde kwibus in de serie, maar daardoor blijf je continu benieuwd wat zijn volgende stap zal zijn.

Terug naar het tweede seizoen: het nieuwe deel zal bestaan uit acht afleveringen. Naast Hardy spelen ook acteurs Jonathan Pryce (High Sparrow in GoT), Oona Chaplin (de vrouw van Robb Stark in GoT), David Hayman (The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas), Jessie Buckley (Beast) en Jefferson Hall (Halloween) in de serie.

Het eerste seizoen van Taboo is te zien op Videoland. Wanneer het tweede seizoen verschijnt, is nog niet duidelijk.

WAAROM IEDERE MAN DE COEN BROTHERS' THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS MOET ZIEN

De Coen Brothers, bekend van de legendarische films The Big Lebowski en No Country For Old Men, brachten deze maand hun spraakmakende film The Ballad of Buster Scruggs uit op Netflix. Een film die iedere man (die houdt van een western) gezien moet hebben, alleen al voor de sterrencast.

Bij het kijken van de film komt direct de vraag op hoe het zou zijn als de film een zesdelige miniserie zou zijn, wat voorheen de bedoeling was. De resten van een serie zijn er in ieder geval: de film is verdeeld in zes figuren met ieder een eigen verhaal, die hun weg banen door het uitgestrekte Amerikaanse Wilde Westen in de negentiende eeuw.

Buster Scruggs (Tim Blake Nelson) is een zingende politieagent en tevens de leidraad in het hele verhaal. Daarnaast zitten in de film verschillende verhalen die elk hun eigen hoofdstuk hebben.

Netflix

Hierboven zie je Buster die in het eerste verhaal verschijnt. Je ziet hem op zijn paard gitaar spelen terwijl hij western liedjes zingt. Buster is niet alleen een opgewekte zingende cowboy, maar ook een psychopathische revolverheld (typisch Coen Brothers die wel van gekkigheid houden). Zijn vijftien minuten durende verhaal eindigt in een reeks gewelddadige gevechten die je op scherp zetten.

Netflix

Het verhaal van James Franco, die 'Cowboy' in de film heet, is een lichter verhaal. Franco speelt een bankovervaller die terechtstaat voor de strafbank van het Wilde Westen. Hij wordt tot tweemaal toe bijna opgehangen, maar ondertussen hangt-ie gewoon nog de lolbroek uit.

Verder zien we acteur Tom Waits als een grijze goudzoeker en Liam Neeson als reizende showman. Net als je je begint af te vragen waar al deze gekkigheid naar toe gaat, leveren de Coen Brothers een prachtig en verwoestend verhaal.

Netflix

Deze gaat over een jonge vrouw (Zoe Kazan) die haar toekomst op de Oregon Trail (een enorm lange historische wagenroute, die veel gebruikt werd door emigranten in de VS) probeert uit te zetten. Daarnaast zie je acteurs Brendan Gleeson en Jonjo O'Neill als premiejagers, die maar al te graag ontsnapte criminelen voor geld leveren aan de rechtbank.

Zou The Ballad of Buster Scruggs als een serie hebben gewerkt? Wij denken eigenlijk van niet, omdat de aparte verhalen niet allemaal toepasselijk zouden zijn voor een hele aflevering.

Dat neemt niet weg dat iedere man deze film gezien moet hebben. De bizarre avonturen van Buster en de andere personages, de somberheid, adembenemende woestijnen, zwarte humor, sterrencast en de grensverleggende scènes maken de film een must see voor iedere western-liefhebber.



Nog niet overtuigd? Bekijk hier dan nog eens de trailer van The Ballad of Buster Scruggs:

NIEMAND GAAT NAAR DE SPORTSCHOOL OM MET JOU TE PRATEN

De zomer staat voor de deur en daarmee dus ook de dagen waarin we in zwembroek door het leven gaan. En denk je aan de zomer, dan denk je aan de sportschool.

Avond na avond sta je je daar in het zweet te werken, jezelf klaarstomend voor je vakantie. En je bent niet de enige.

In Nederland zijn meer dan 2,2 miljoen mensen lid bij een sportschool. De ene abonnementhouder is er iets frequenter te vinden dan de ander, maar een ieder doet zijn best.

Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

De een neemt de sportschool heel serieus, de ander ziet het als een sociale gelegenheid. En dit verschil levert interessante situaties op.

Daarom is het een goed idee om het volgende in gedachten te houden tijdens je volgende training:

Is het oké om in de sportschool tegen iemand te praten?

Meestal niet. Net zoals in alle situaties, moet je de sfeer proberen te proeven. Sta je in een groepsles te boksen of spinnen en vraagt de instructeur of iedereen zich wil voorstellen? Dan kun je natuurlijk even je moment pakken.

Buiten de groepslessen is het toch wel een beetje ieder voor zich. Niet voor niets heeft een groot deel van het sportende volk zijn oortjes in gedurende een workout. Hoe gek het ook klinkt, deze fitboys betalen geen maandelijks bedrag om met jou te kunnen socializen.

Welk soort gesprek kan dan wel?

Er zijn altijd bezoekers die slechts voor de sier komen. Vaak zijn het de oudere mannen die mannenclubs gewend zijn en dat is niet echt meer van deze tijd.

Ze nemen plaats op het roeiapparaat, om gezamenlijk de goede oude tijden te bespreken en de rest van de bezoekers eens goed te bestuderen. Zo iemand wil je natuurlijk niet zijn.

KEPT2

Dus helemaal geen gesprek voeren?

Probeer alleen te spreken wanneer jouw woorden enig nut dienen. Niks mis met: "Hé man, gebruik je die nog?"

Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

Of dat zeggen wat iedereen denkt, dat mag ook nog wel. Je zal echter al snel op het weer uitkomen en die guy wil je dan ook weer niet

Wat als ik advies wil over een toestel?

Vraag maar raak! De meeste mensen zullen met alle plezier uitleggen hoe iets werkt. De die hard sportschoolbezoeker is namelijk dol op mansplaining.

Mocht je echt behoefte hebben aan contact en advies willen vragen, dan kan dat natuurlijk niet aan iedereen. Wil je advies over gewichtheffen en je biceps? Dan vraag je dit logischerwijs aan een man met flinke armen en niet aan die blonde dame van 1 meter 60, die alleen haar buik en billen traint.

En flirten? Mag dat dan wel?

Nee.

Maar ik zie een mooie dame en ze keek net ook naar mij...

Nee, dat deed ze niet.

En wat nou als ik doe alsof ik hulp nodig heb, om zo met haar te praten?

Ja, dat zal vast wel werken. Ze heeft dat sowieso niet door.

Oké, maar stel nou dat ik er echt heel goed uitzie?

Dan kun je je gang gaan. De hele wereld is van jou en wij zijn er gewoon als decoratie.

Dus je zegt eigenlijk dat ik in de sportschool geen vrienden kan maken?

Nee, dat zeggen we niet. Wel zeggen we dat je het niet moet forceren. Wanneer je vaker bij dezelfde sportschool komt en iemand elke week tegenkomt, kan het vanzelf ontstaan.

Iemand met een shirt van jouw favoriete speler? Dan kun je het prima over de wedstrijd van gisteravond hebben. En als je vanuit dat punt op je werk en je hobby's terecht komt, is dat ook prima.

Uiteindelijk vind je er misschien zelfs wel je gym buddy, maar om zo'n diepe vertrouwensband te creëren heb je meer dan één avond nodig.

"De meeste mensen zullen met alle plezier uitleggen hoe iets werkt. De die hard sportschoolbezoeker is namelijk dol op mansplaining."

Kan ik mensen begroeten die niet mijn gym buddy zijn?

Als het iemand is die je elke sportsessie weer tegen het lijf loopt, dan wel. Een vriendelijk knikje volstaat echter ook.

Wat als ik iemand buiten de sportschool herken?

Ja, nu ben je de sjaak. Er breekt een tijd aan waarin je elke dag naar deze persoon moet knikken, zolang als je daar zult sporten.

Wat als het de mooie dame van de vorige keer is waar ik mee wilde flirten?

Wat is ook alweer jouw voornaamste reden om naar de sportschool te gaan?

KEPT2

En bellen tijdens het sporten?

Alsjeblieft niet, zeg. We komen er om ons hoofd leeg te maken en de sixpack voller, niet om aan te horen hoe jij met je vrienden een gesprek over je favoriete insta model voert.

En daarbij is het ook een beetje lullig als je hijgend met je vrienden aan het bellen bent, terwijl je de eindsprint op de loopband inzet. Keep running.

Got it. Ik zal mijn oortjes indoen en mezelf op de achtergrond houden...

Niet te snel. Zo makkelijk ben je niet van ons af. De regel is in principe dat je niet zinloos tegen iedereen aanpraat.

Toch is er ook iets als jezelf teveel isoleren. Een sportschool is een openbare ruimte, dus je kunt ook weer niet je ogen sluiten en doen alsof er niemand anders is.

Eigenlijk zijn de regels gewoon hetzelfde als op de basisschool: samen zul je alles delen, ruim je zooi op en alleen praten als je de beurt krijgt. Oftewel: als de situatie of de persoon in kwestie er naar vraagt.

OP DEZE MANIER KRIJG JE DE GROOTSTE CAFEÏNE-BOOST VAN JE KOP KOFFIE

Gisteravond ben je iets te laat naar bed gegaan. Je zou één drankje doen, maar gek genoeg werden dat er acht. En daar zit je dan: met wallen onder je ogen en een vermoeid gevoel op de rand van je bed. Klaar om naar je koffiezetapparaat te sprinten.



Stop! Dat is niet de manier. Hoe dan wel? Wij leggen je uit hoe je de grootste boost uit je koffie kan halen. Succes vandaag!

Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

1. Wacht minstens een kwartier na het wakker worden met je eerste kop koffie

Het is heel normaal dat je vermoeid wakker wordt. Om precies te zijn heet dat slaapmatheid, wat zorgt voor een verminderd reactievermogen en een verslechterd kortetermijngeheugen. Dit is een kwartier nadat je opstaat al weer over.

Gooi je er gelijk een sloot koffie in, dan bestaat de kans dat je veel meer cafeïne nuttigt dan daadwerkelijk nodig is. Wacht dus nog even!

2. Laat minstens anderhalf uur tussen elke kop koffie zitten

Veel mensen drinken hun eerste kop koffie, voelen er niks van en nemen er maar nog één om wél wat te voelen. (De fout die iedereen ook met spacecake maakt, maar dat terzijde).

Cafeïne heeft echter een goed half uur nodig om tot maximale effectiviteit te komen, dus de kick die mensen denken te voelen is pas de cafeïne van de eerste kop. Weer een half uur later kickt de volgende kop in en voor je het weet, stuiter je jouw kantoor binnen.

3. Drink er niet te veel van

Getty Images

In een normaal kopje vind je ongeveer tweehonderd milligram cafeïne, wat genoeg is om de meeste mensen twee uur lang op een cafeïne piek te houden. Daarna verlaat het langzaam je systeem.



Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

Krijg je echter meer dan tweehonderd milligram cafeïne binnen, dan geeft het je eerder een rusteloos gevoel dan een boost. Niet fijn dus.

4. Bewaar het voor de broodnodige momenten en wissel af

Getty Images

Interessant feitje: je brein gaat zich instellen op de momenten dat jij routinematig jouw kop koffie drinkt. Bijvoorbeeld dat eeuwige kopje om kwart over zeven bij het ontbijt. Na een tijdje gaat dat kopje je niet meer over je ochtenddip slepen door de gewenning.

Wissel daarom de tijdstippen waarop je koffie drinkt af, want op het moment dat je brein de cafeïne het minst verwacht, kickt 'ie er juist het hardst in. Met extra focus en beter geheugen als gevolg.

De whisky's zijn geordend op smaak in zogeheten Flavor Profiles, zodat je gemakkelijk jouw favoriete smaken kunt vinden. Of je nou op zoek bent naar een hele rokerige of juist een pittige whisky; vink je voorkeuren aan en de app doet het werk.

Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

Je kunt zelfs de barcode van een fles whisky scannen om te zien wat andere liefhebbers ervan vinden. Makkelijker wordt het niet.



Op basis van de beste recensies hebben we met Wiep een top tien gemaakt van whisky's onder de € 50. Het is een klein voorproefje van wat Whisky Suggest te bieden heeft.

Lagavulin 16 Year Old

Lagavulin

Deze Schotse whisky heeft minstens zestien jaar op eiken vaten gerijpt en kent de rokerige smaak die typerend is voor de zuidelijke regio waar die vandaan komt.

De Lagavulin destilleerderij werd opgericht in 1816 door John Johnston, maar in 1742 bestonden er al zeker tien illegale destilleerderijen in Lagavulin. Het verhaal gaat dan ook dat dit de oudste destilleerderij van Schotland is.

Een flesje van deze whisky kost € 47,50.

Ardbeg 10 Year Old

Ardbeg

Deze Ardbeg is een rokerige Islay malt whisky uit Schotland. Het ruige eiland was een inspiratie voor Ardbeg en dat proef je, want het is een geturfde en rokerige whisky die past bij zijn omgeving.

Niet echt geschikt voor beginners, want deze 10 Year Old wordt gezien als een van de meest complexe whisky's, maar tegelijkertijd ook als een van de beste single malts ter wereld.

In 2008 ging de prijs van 'World Whisky of the Year' naar deze whisky. De Ardbeg 10 Years Old koop je voor € 39,95.

Blanton's Original

Blanton's Original

Bourbon wordt al eeuwenlang gemaakt, maar single barrel bourbon kennen we pas sinds 1984 en het bleek een ware revolutie in de industrie. En natuurlijk zit er ook een mooi verhaal achter de bourbon die op één vat rijpt.

Kolonel Albert Blanton ontdekte ooit een pakhuis waar de lekkerste bourbon gerijpt werd. Hij was zelfs zo kieskeurig dat hij de vaten in het midden van het pakhuis koos, ofwel: the center cut. Nadat hij uit meerdere vaten bourbon proefde koos hij één vat die het best bij hem in de smaak viel en liet deze bottelen.

Hierna was de Blanton's Original alleen bedoeld voor hoogwaardigheidsbekleders en vrienden van de kolonel. Vandaag de dag is de whisky gelukkig voor iedereen.

Advertentie - Lees hieronder verder

Je proeft een enigszins zoete whisky, met smaken van citrus, eiken, vanille, noten, karamel, sinaasappel en chocolade. Deze whisky drink je het best on the rocks.

Een Blanton's Original heb je al voor € 47,50 in huis.

Redbreast 12 Year Old

Redbreast

Een whisky met een harmonieuze balans tussen kruiden, fruit, romigheid, sherry en geroosterde noten. Door de lange afdronk blijven de complexe en volle smaken mooi behouden.

Deze Ierse whiskey komt rechtstreeks van het vat, is ongefilterd en er is geen water aan toegevoegd. Puurder kun je het niet krijgen.

De Redbreast 12 Year Old koop je voor € 39,95.

Glenfarclas 105

Glenfarclas

De naam van deze Schotse whisky komt uit het Gaelic, de taal van een stam uit de Schotse Hooglanden, en betekent 'vallei van het groene grasland'. Opgericht in 1865 is dit bedrijf al zes generaties lang in de familie.

De 105 is een stevige whisky, die rechtstreeks uit het vat gedronken kan worden, maar beter tot zijn recht komt met een beetje water erbij. Het was ooit zelfs een van de eerste single malts die op vatsterkte werd gebotteld.

De Glenfarclas 105 won meerdere awards, waaronder zilver bij de International Wine & Spirit Competition. Deze whisky voeg je voor € 39,95 toe aan je collectie.

Amrut Fusion

Amrut

Deze whisky wordt 'Fusion' genoemd, omdat van zowel Schotse als Indische granen gebruik is gemaakt. De Amrut Fusion hoort ongetwijfeld thuis in dit rijtje, want in Jim Murray's Whisky Bible wordt-ie beloond met 97 punten.

Bij deze whisky proef je eiken, koffie en donkere chocolade. Met een lange afdronk die zoet, kruidig en fruitig tegelijk is, is het een aangename whisky om te drinken.

De Amrut Fusion koop je voor € 37,95.

Laphroaig Quarter Cask

Laphroaig

Ook deze single malt komt van het Schotse eiland Islay. Het rijpingsproces van deze whiskey is een stuk intensiever, omdat deze rijpt in andere vaten. Deze vaten zorgen voor één derde meer houtcontact en dat geeft een zachter en zoeter karakter aan de smaak.

Uiteindelijk is de turfrook kenmerkend voor Laphroaig en deze komt sterk terug. Het zorgt voor een krachtige en intense smaak.

Voor € 44,99 kun je deze Laphroaig gaan proeven.

Compass Box The Spice Tree

Deze blended malt komt uit de Schotse Hooglanden en is gerijpt op eiken vaten uit Frankrijk. Je ruikt gedroogde kruiden, eiken, vanille en specerijen, met tonen van bourbon en peper. De whisky kent smaken van gember, toffee, vanille, kruiden en peper en heeft een kruidige afdronk die hem rijk van smaak maakt.

Compass Box is nog vrij nieuw in de whiskywereld: John Glaser richtte het in 2000 op, na jaren in de wijnhandel te hebben gezeten. Het was Glasers plan om één van de mooiste whisky's van Schotland te maken en dat lijkt hem te lukken. John Glaser zelf wordt in ieder geval gezien als één van de meest gerespecteerde destilleerders van zijn tijd.

Voor € 42,50 drink je deze blended malt van Compass Box.

Balvenie 14 Year Old Caribbean Cask

The Balvenie

Deze 14 Year Old Caribbean Cask een prachtige whisky waar je de kwaliteit van kunt proeven. The Balvenie verbouwt zijn eigen gerst, mout zijn eigen mout op een eigen traditionele moutvloer, laat de vaten verzorgen door zijn eigen kuipers en heeft een eigen kopersmid om de ketels te onderhouden.

En om het af te maken: de langstwerkende malt meester uit de industrie, David Stewart, is werkzaam bij The Balvenie en stelt al meer dan vijftig jaar de whisky's samen.

Deze Caribbean Cask heeft veertien jaar op vaten van Amerikaans eikenhout gerijpt. Aan het eind van het rijpingsproces wordt de whisky overgeschonken in vaten waar voorheen rum uit de Cariben in heeft gerijpt.

Dit hele proces resulteert in een single malt whisky met het honingzoete karakter van Balvenie. Dat, in combinatie met tonen van toffee en een hint van fruit, zorgt voor een lange en warme afdronk.

Voor € 49,99 drink je deze bijzondere whisky.

Johnnie Walker Green Label

Deze blend is een samenstelling van producten uit heel Schotland. Deze malt rijpt minimaal 15 jaar en dat zorgt voor een volle gelaagde whisky.



Een rijke blend waarvoor alleen malts gebruikt worden, afkomstig uit alle hoeken van Schotland. In deze Johnnie Walker vind je tonen van vers gemaaid gras, vers fruit, houtrook, peper en vanille.

De Johnnie Walker Green Label kost € 44,99.
