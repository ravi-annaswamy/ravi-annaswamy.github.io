BEST BLACK FRIDAY AND CYBER MONDAY UK TV AND BROADBAND DEALS 2018

The biggest shopping season of the year is in full swing. But before you invest in a new TV package or broadband deal during the Black Friday period, there are a few things you should keep in mind.

The Independent's technology critic David Phelan has given us the heads up on what to look out for, and what type of deal will suit you best. We've found the most impressive deals so far, from cinema packages to superfast broadband.

If you have the latest, high-resolution 4K model, then bear in mind that to watch native 4K content from Netflix, Amazon Prime or Apple TV, then you need a fast broadband connection – Netflix recommends a minimum of 25Mbps.

When you're watching 4K content on Sky, it is often downloaded to the Sky Q 2TB box before you watch, so it's not quite so important, though it'll take a long time to download with a slower connection, obviously. And if it's live sport on BT, Virgin or Sky, then a faster connection is highly desirable for 4K.

Note also that 4K movies can be several gigabytes in size, so unlimited data is recommended. If your line does slow down while you're watching, the picture quality will drop from 4K to HD – still good but not as noticeably pristine.

Some networks can throttle the speed of connections at peak times, or slow down upload speeds (which will affect you if you're sending a home movie to the cloud, but not if you're watching a streamed movie). Check the fine print.

Sky

A staple in most households, Sky is a wise investment for large families, but buying one of its extensive packages can prove costly. Last year, the household name offered a range of discounts including a monthly charge of £10 for Sky Cinema – a contract which usually costs £30 a month. To make this deal even more appealing Sky also announced the launch of three new film channels: Sky Cinema Christmas, Sky Cinema Classics and Sky Cinema Musicals.

Best deals:

Sky Cinema, £10 extra a month for 18 months – buy now

Broadband and TV package: 36MB average internet speed and over 300 TV channels, £40 a month for 18 months – buy now

Now TV

Last year, NOW TV offered heavy discounts all its TV passes with two months for the price of one on its Sky Cinema Pass, Entertainment Pass, Kids Pass and Sky Sports Pass. The company is yet to confirm if it will be taking part in any deals this time round but we expect there will be some great discounts on offer.

Best deals:

​Virgin Media

The Full House Bundle: Over 230 TV channels, line rental and unlimited broadband with 108MBPS average download speed – was £57, now £45 a month for 12 months – buy now

​The VIP Bundle: Full House TV + Sky Cinema HD + Sky Sports HD + Extra box VIVID 350 fibre broadband – was £89, now £75 a month – buy now

Amazon Prime Video

With everything from TV series to movies and documentaries, Amazon Prime Video has it all. If you want to test it first, you can get a 30-day trial of Amazon Prime for free.

Internet package deals

BT

One of the most well-known companies in the UK, BT offers discounts across a range of products from broadband to TV, mobile and laptops. Last year, it offered month discounts on fibre broadband, cut setup costs and gave away £125 BT Reward Cards across every broadband package.

Best deals:

BT Broadband: 10MB with BT line rental, £24.99 a month for 18 months – buy now

Superfast Fibre: 50MB with BT line rental, £29.99 a month for 18 months – buy now

Superfast Fibre Plus: 67MB with BT line rental, a 'keep connected promise', a price freeze for 18 months, and double data for mobiles on Plus accounts, £54.99 a month for 18 months – buy now

Virgin Media

A company that offers flexible and high-quality service at super-speeds, it’s no wonder that more and more of us are converting to Virgin Media. The good news is that it took part in Black Friday last year with impressive bundles that cost £18, down from £27, and we expect more of the same this tie round.

The brand treats its TV service as separate to broadband in terms of bandwidth, so you can't impede picture quality on the living room TV because someone's downloading a big file in the bedroom. But that doesn't apply to every network, so maybe warn the rest of the family before the big game, or the big movie, is on!

Best deals:

Vivid 50 Fibre Broadband: 54 MBPS average speed, £35 a month for 12 months – buy now

Vivid 100 Fibre Broadband: 108MBPS average speed, £40 month for 12 months – buy now

Vivid 200 Fibre Broadband: 213MBPS average speed, £45 a month for 12 months – buy now

Vivid 350 Fibre Broadband: 362MBPS average speed, £50 a month for 12 months – buy now

Sky

A trusty household name in the UK, Sky is best known for its all-encompassing collection of TV channels but it also offers some great deals on broadbrand too. For Black Friday 2017, new customers could sign up with Sky Fibre Unlimited and Box Sets TV for £50 per month, each priced at £25. Additionally, it also cut costs on its Variety bundle to just £25 per month.

Best deals:

Sky Broadband Unlimited 11MB, £18 a month for 18 months – buy now

Sky Fibre Unlimited 36MB, £25 a month for 18 months - buy now

Sky Fibre Max 63MB, £30 a month for 18 months – buy now

Broadband and TV package: 36MB average internet speed and over 300 TV channels, £40 a month for 18 months – buy now

EE

EE offers a good variety of deals all year round but especially so during Black Friday. Last year, the company offered EE Reward prepaid cards on its broadband deals, ranging from £50 up to £125, depending on the package.

Best deals:

Unlimited Fibre Broadband 36MB, £25 a month for 18 months – buy now

Unlimited Fibre Broadband Plus 67MB, £30 a month for 18 months – buy now

Unlimited Fibre Max 1 Broadband 145MB, £40 a month for 18 months – buy now

The simplest way to start thinking about the kind of laptop you want is to pick an operating system. If you want macOS, the most intuitive and elegant of the software systems, you can only choose an Apple machine. The widest range of programs and applications are available on Windows laptops, so if there’s a program you need that's only available on Windows, that’s the choice made for you.

And if you only need the laptop for word processing, web browsing and so on, you might be able to manage with a Chromebook. Here, we explain the main types in more detail.

Windows

These are still the most widely used computers, by far, thanks to the enormous range of applications and most familiar interface. The latest version, Windows 10, combines traditional PC styling (a desktop with folders of programs) with a tablet-style look of app icons arranged on a grid. It also works with hybrid laptops where the screen detaches or folds back on itself to work like a tablet.

Windows machines are available with or without touchscreens so that may be a consideration. Microsoft makes the software and more recently has created a small but excellent range of hardware too – the Surface series.

Chromebooks

Google’s OS is slick and simple. It was originally designed to work only when your laptop was connected to the internet. The premise was that all the heavy processing would be done in the cloud so there was no need for a powerful chip in the laptop, thus reducing costs greatly. But the Achilles’ heel was that offline the hardware was very limited.

Now, though, the main programs (Google’s email, document, spreadsheet and presentation software) largely work when you’re offline, too. Some Chromebooks work with Android apps as well. Google makes its own Chromebook called Pixel.

MacBooks

Apple makes the hardware and software for its computers, resulting in an integrated system which works beautifully. The MacBook Air was a game-changer – a laptop so slim and light it was first revealed when then Apple CEO Steve Jobs slid it out of an envelope.

The range is small: as well as the Air there is the MacBook and the extra-powerful MacBook Pro, which has great innovations like the Touch Bar. This is where the top row of function keys is replaced by a narrow touchscreen where the virtual buttons change according to what you’re doing.

The Pro range is far from cheap, mind. There are no touchscreen MacBooks, nor any with a slot for a sim card for continuous internet access.

Laptop Features

It’s also important to keep an eye out for a number of relevant features when buying including screen size and weight, purpose, power, memory, graphics and battery life.

For example, if you plan on carrying this laptop with you, a lighter, smaller laptop is best. Similarly, gamers will want to invest in an option that comes with top-notch graphics, while those who work on-the-go will appreciate a longer battery life.

Size Matters

Choosing which laptop size to go for should be one of the first things you consider, and this all depends on what you'll be using it for. Laptop sizes range from 11.6 inches all the way up to 17.3 inches, but the most common sizes you'll see are 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch and 17-inch. If you're looking for something really light, opt for a laptop that weighs less than 2kg.

Smaller notebooks (11-inch to 13-inch) are lighter to carry and are a great option if you're looking to travel with your laptop a lot, but they can offer less storage and smaller batteries, so watch out.

Medium sized machines (14-inch to 15-inch) are good for work at home, casual gaming, longer battery life and more storage space. The largest 17-inch screens are ideal for desktop replacements but are much tougher to carry around.

Screen Quality

Since most of us will either be slaving away working on our new purchase, or enjoying Netflix in the evenings – screen type is an important factor to consider when choosing your new laptop. Glossy screens result in reflections which you don't want if you're gaming, editing images, or watching a lot of video content. Touchscreen laptops usually tend to come with a glossy finish, so you'll have to weigh up the pro's and con's of both if you're in the market for the touch feature.

If you're looking to view multiple elements at once, opt for full HD resolution: 1920x1080-pixels. Gamers should look out for the refresh rate on the laptop displays, as nobody wants to lose their competitive edge with screen lag. 4K resolution is available but is an extremely pricey feature. However, it is ideal for videographers or photographers. A screen with IPS (in-plane switching) display will offer the widest viewing angles.

Performance

The main factors to look out for when considering the performance of a new laptop are the processor, storage, and graphics. You'll see processors being called CPU in laptop specs, most of them will be made by Intel – the main types being i3, i5 and i7. Core i3-based laptops tend to feature in entry level systems which are ideal for simple tasks like creating word documents and browsing the internet, i5 tends to be the standard choice for decent performance, whereas i7 is the top-end performance choice. Most people don't need the power that an i7 machine offers, unless you're a gamer-guru.

The more RAM your machine has, the more applications it can run smoothly at the same time. More data can also be accessed quickly which is good for video editors. When choosing the amount, opt for 8GB as a minimum. Gamers will want to ramp it up to as much as 32GB for optimum experience.

Nowadays, laptops will usually have graphics integrated into the CPU, which is suitable for casual gaming but not anything further. Avid gamers should opt for a GPU – a graphics unit separate from your processor.

10 BEST BOURBONS

Bourbon, the whiskey of America. Here, we discover the top picks from across the UK for both experts and novices alike.

So, in a nutshell, what exactly makes bourbon, bourbon? Let’s talk simple – at least 51 per cent of the grains must be produced from corn and the spirit itself must be aged in new charred white oak barrels and produced in the USA.

Obviously, there’s a lot more that could probably be said – but for the purpose of time, let’s just get to the good stuff.

Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Select: £30, Sainsbury's

Jack Daniel’s are one of the most famous names in whiskey on a worldwide level and while the standard ‘Jack’ hits the spot at a value level, it’s the Single Barrel range that truly shines in the spotlight for me.

Single Barrel is crafted with love and affection and boy oh boy does that show on the taste.

Rich toasty notes of oak, dried apricots and honey glazed fruits sit alongside a cinnamon popcorn, white pepper and Christmas cake spice that escapes from the glass as soon as its poured. I call this my nostalgia whiskey and for the money you pay – it’s sure to create some happy memories.

Buy now

Elijah Craig Small Batch: £37, Amazon

Who would have thought a Baptist preacher would go on to create one of the world’s most celebrated small batch bourbons? Reverend Elijah Craig certainly knew his way around the stills and it was his pioneering attitude that placed Elijah Craig on the map in the 1800s, where he’s still considered the Father of Bourbon today.

The ‘Small Batch’ expression get its place on this list due to its exuberant mix of fresh toffee and caramel with dark plums, brambles and a little nutty vanilla entwined with coconut. Great product at a great price.

Buy now

Evan Williams Extra Aged Bourbon: £26, Ocado

Produced since 1783, Evan Williams is produced along the banks of the Ohio River in Kentucky. Evan Williams was in fact Kentucky’s first distiller of Kentucky Bourbon and the Extra Aged is a testament to the smooth profile the distillery has become known for, for decades.

While the nose gives you a creamy rich oak with caramel and brown sugar, sumptuous notes of mint and Madagascan vanilla set this out from the crowd. Not to mention its value/quality ratio at just £26 a bottle!

Buy now

FEW Bourbon: £51.55, The Whiskey Exchange

FEW have a unique ability to place fun and spirit side by side with their eclectic range. It’s their Bourbon, however, which makes this list. Deep rooted with southern tradition, this three-grain beauty is soaked with herbs, cloves and a sweet vanilla toffee.

Wrapped up with a kiss of spice on the finish, this is a bourbon that will keep your toes warm during the colder months.

Buy now

Four Roses Single Barrel: £37, Uvinum

The most bespoke offering of the Four Roses range see’s the Single Barrel handpicked as the ultimate barrel selection. The distillery itself has become known for creating its unique bourbons based on 5 ‘secret yeast strains’ that give them their unique flavour combinations.

We'd describe this beauty as complex yet elegant – plum and redcurrants jump out on the nose with an array of baking spices, pepper and maple syrup. As the glass continues to open up you experience cocoa, Madagascan vanilla beans and a rich marzipan.

Buy now

Woodford Reserve Double Oaked: £47, Amazon

Whenever we hear ‘double oaked’, we get a little excited – and for those who like nothing more than a big vanilla-oak bourbon, you’ll get exactly what we mean.

We’re no stranger to Woodford Reserve but their double oak is packed with incredible flavour, leaving you wanting more from the moment you crack the bottle open.

Rich, sumptuous and naughty with a sweet and spicy nature. Dark fruits combine with a dark caramel chocolate, roasted hazelnuts and marzipan wrapped up in baked honeyed apples and that renowned creamy vanilla finish.

Buy now

Yellowstone Select Bourbon: £49, The Whiskey Exchange

Named after the famous Yellowstone National Park, this bourbon was brought back to life in 2010 by 7th Generation whisky veterans Paul and Steve Beam.

This Kentucky straight bourbon is produced from local corn, malt and rye with a dash of limestone water for good measure. A hand-picked blend of spicy, sweet and smoky bourbons are blended together, producing a rich golden bourbon that screams cherry, leather, smoked salted cameral and demerara sugar. Yep, we're drooling just a little too.

Buy now

Wild Turkey 101: £32, Master of Malt

When it comes to rye, Wild Turkey is arguably one of the Kings and what I like most about the 101 is its ability to create some seriously good cocktails alongside being perfect for a single serve. Aged for a minimum of 6 years before leaving the barrel there’s an unmistakable sweet caramel toffee that wraps itself around the tongue.

Rich, dense and spicy you can expect to taste butterscotch, melted butter and a slight citrus zing which brings everything together in harmony. Fantastic value.

Buy now

Old Forester: £31, Asda

Ah, good ol’ Old Forester – the staple supermarket go-to when you need that bourbon fix. Little known fact, Old Forester is in fact the only bourbon to have been distilled both prior to and after the prohibition by the same founding family – that’s over 140 years. If you look close enough you still see the same handwritten ‘quality guarantee’ on each and every bottle.

When it comes to tasting, there’s a lovely orange rind and floral note that jumps out of the glass alongside sweet vanilla oak. The palate gives you salted toffee apples, maple syrup and a spicy orange marmalade. Phwoar!

Buy now

The Verdict: Best bourbons

There’s no question that American bourbons are on the rise and with each year that goes by we get more of a selection. This list gives a comprehensive overview of what you can expect to find with good availability alongside a few hidden treats for those who aren’t afraid to venture off the beaten track.

While your staple names like Elijah Craig, Old Forester and Wild Turkey will always delight, it’s Yellowstone and FEW that showcase more of a individualistic profile.

The top spot, however? Well, this one goes to good ol’ JD – the Single barrel select. They may produce a lot, but boy do they know what they’re doing. Great value and phenomenal quality gives this bourbon our seal of approval.

Adrian Smith is a presenter of the Amazon Prime TV series, The Three Drinkers.

10 BEST WINTER HATS FOR MEN

Ever seen that guy walking down the street that you've looked at and thought to yourself 'Wow, that is a really cool hat'? Well today you can become that guy. The one everyone envies, the one who suits the hat that is in fashion. From the beanie to the bobble to the flat cap, there are so many options this winter that will make you feel good, look good and at the same time protect you from wind and the rain.

The bonus of all this is that with some, you can wear them throughout the year (note: we do not endorse wearing bobble or beanie hats in the summer months, especially if it's another heatwave like the one we've just seen!) Winter brights are the in-season trend this winter, but a plain grey, black or brown still go a long way to completing your look, so whether you're looking to be experimental with your colour range or stick to what you know, you'll find something you like on this list.

Hats are often the first thing a person will notice about a look, so how do you choose the right one? Lucky for you, we've tried and tested the very best around and whittled them down to a top 10, from the everyday affordable to those who want to treat themselves - this has something for everyone.

Weekday Peace Force Hero Knit Beanie: £10, Weekday

This hat isn't just a great look – nor will it just stand out, but it'll make you feel good about yourself and that's for the reason it promotes a message of peace. Coming in small/medium and large/extra large, you'll be able to find the size for you.

The limited edition Weekday x non-violence hat is 100 per cent acrylic and provides a bit of a skater look, with three different colours available to choose from: black, orange and green. Hurry up though, they're selling fast! To help you complete your look, below the link on the site are some more Weekday x non-violence items, including t-shirts and scarves, so you'll never run out of options to compliment the hat. Just don't overload on orange as tempting as it is!

Next Ribbed Beanie: £10, Next

A stylish look that has fleece lining, this beanie from Next is a great look for the winter months, the colour scheme will go with pretty much any outfit when you're looking to wrap up warm and the soft feel to it gives you an almost cashmere-like material. It sits on your head nicely and covers your ears, although we recommend wearing it a little higher up on the head for a more slightly fashionable look. As with most hats, it's a one size fits all so this is a simple but elegant choice - especially for those on a budget. Comes in an array of colours including black, green and red, should you fancy something else.

Buy now

Carhartt Acrylic Watch Hat A18 Hat: £15.42, Amazon

Arguably the coolest feature of the Carhartt acrylic hat is in fact its logo. It’s a hat that suits a more casual look, the material is warm and the darker green colour we’ve opted for is trendy and will go well with a number of outfits for the winter months. We recommend wearing this with a white top and black jeans, maybe even go for a rip in them just to show off how trendy you really are. Should you fancy a different colour for this one, you have your options. 28 options to be exact in pretty much every shade you could hope for – so you will certainly find the one to keep you warm this winter.

Buy now

Next Grey Grid Texture Flat Cap: £16, Next

Who knew Next could pretty much do it all? They're good for their general clothing range but add flat caps to that list right now because if you want that sophisticated look, look no further than here. Flat caps are becoming a much more popular look among a younger generation.

This has an adjustable strap at the back, allowing you to find the right fit for you. It's a hat we recommend because it'll be good to wear throughout the year. It also comes in small/medium and large/extra large, so we'd suggest trying it on for size first rather than purchasing it immediately online - just so you can be sure it suits you and fits well. We recommend wearing this with a nice overcoat, go and channel your inner Tommy Shelby.

Buy now

Levi Sportswear Logo Beanie: £25, Levi

For the sportier among you going to games or simply just preferring that kind of look, this Levi's beanie is the one for you. It's warm, one size and has that retro look to it with the classic colour scheme. Again this one comes in a number of different colours ranging from cream to purple to blue, so if the one we've gone for isn't to your taste, you've got a number of options to go for. You can wear this with pretty much any look, but you'll probably be wearing something more everyday if this is the one you want to go for.

Buy now

Barbour Throttle Watchcap: £44.95, Barbour

The. Material. Not much more needs to be said about this one, but we'll give you more. Made from knitted lambswool, this is the perfect hat to keep you warm and looking good this winter, and comes in grey, blue and black. Slightly on the pricier side of the range - but if you do get it you won't regret it, emblazoned with the Barbour International logo to the left of it, this is a good one for a casual look. It's a one size fits all hat and will sit right above your ears and keep you comfortable for hours in the cold.

Buy now

Universal Works Estrela Bobble Hat In Orange Fair Isle Stripe: £30, Universal Works

Not the most well known brand but certainly the most comfortable hat. A classic ski beanie is how it's described on the company's website and that's exactly what it is. A lovely bobble to keep you looking slick whether you're on the sloaps, walking around some Christmas markets or just on your daily commute. Another one made from wool (80 per cent, 20 per cent polyamide), this one is all about the stitching and design - with a lovely orange colour at the top. It comes in a one size fits all, you'll probably wear this when you're wrapping up warm in your bomber jacket and is the perfect style for the winter season.

Buy now

Quiksilver Shaw beanie: £32, Quiksilver

A classic comfortable fit that you can wear in so many ways - another one size that fits all for your convenience, it's another with a bobble (because who doesn't love a bobble in the colder months to keep them cosy?), this time featuring three different colours.

You can also get this one in a black and grey look - but we preferred this one. This one will be best fit going all the way down your head and covering your ears, although it can be a little bit itchy if you wear it for too long. A brand that is known for its sporty attire, this will definitely go with your snowboarding/skiing outfits in the winter months.

Buy now

Topman Toffee Skater Beanie: £8, Topman

A classic for the skater look – you can turn up in toffee with this one. At the affordable price of £8, this one size fits all hat sits snug on your head with a tight fit and will look particularly good mixed with black or white clothing. Whether you're on a budget or not – this is a hat you need as an option this winter. Also comes in a number of different colours from white to blue, Topman are always a strong everyday option and increase their appeal more so with this one.

Buy now

Crew Clothing Company Nepp hat: £25, Crew Clothing Company

Crew Clothing is more and more becoming the cool brand you need to stay ahead of the curve on - so get going with it. This grey hat is for a more casual look, but during the colder months would you want to look anything else? With a speckled wool blend, it has a contrast of navy blue with the logo to the left. It also comes in white and has the gloves and scarf to match should you choose to go for the full look.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best winter hats for men

While Carharrt offers great options and Next have the flat clap which can hold a special place in the heart for generations, the Weekday x non-violence collaboration simply can't be looked past. It's warm, affordable, a statement hat, it'll go with pretty much anything and more key than anything, it'll make you feel good every time you put it on. What more could you want?

What is Black Friday?

Black Friday has nothing to do with the UK’s traditional winter sales, but originates from America. In the US, it traditionally follows Thanksgiving and is widely regarded as the beginning of he Christmas shopping season.

This year, the event started on Friday, 23 November and runs until Monday, 26 November.

How can you get the best deals?

When it comes to making the most of Black Friday, preparation is key and, with 98 per cent of the UK’s shoppers planning to buy online, that’s where you can expect to find the very best deals.

But, whether you’re shopping in-store or bargain hunting from the comfort of your sofa, it’s important to shop around and research items you want to buy well in advance rather than splashing out on a whim.

We suggest sticking to a shopping list of items that you know you actually want, setting yourself a budget and watching out for additional discount codes online.

It’s also a good idea to check retailer’s returns policies before buying and to check terms and conditions for sites you’ve not used before.

For your one-stop shop of all the very best deals, make sure to keep checking our Black Friday pages where we will be constantly updating the best deals.

How long will the discounts last?

Black Friday 2018 looks set to be one of the longest-running yet. Last year, it went from just one weekend to an entire week, so you can expect that trend to continue this time round.

What were the best deals last year?

Last year, there was some impressive deals on the then-new Nintendo Switch and a number of discounts on mobile phones including the iPhone 7 and X, the Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy S8.

Amazon’s own product range – including Echo devices, Fire tablets and Kindles –had massive discounts too, as did PS4 and Xbox One bundles, OLED TVs and 2-in-1 laptops.

Can I get cashback on Black Friday deals?

This all depends on your debit or credit card provider. During the Black Friday period, a number of companies offer cashback on purchases while websites such as Quidco also offer cashback for new customers of big brands.

What is Cyber Monday?

A continuation of Black Friday, Cyber Monday is an online-only sale – hence the name.

It always takes place on the Monday following Black Friday which this year falls on 26 November.

What’s the difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday?

There isn’t much of a difference between the two at all. Originally, Cyber Monday was completely unconnected to Black Friday as it focused on all of its deals being online.

However, with the growing popularity of Black Friday, both in store and online, the lines have become more and more blurred.

Am I protected on Black Friday and Cyber Monday?

As well as genuine deals, Black Friday and Cyber Monday can bring out fraudsters so it’s important to be vigilant.

Make sure you check any emails you receive properly before clicking links to make sure they’re legitimate.

If you’re shopping from a computer, it’s also a good idea to ensure your anti-malware software is up to date.

13 BEST BABY SNOWSUITS

There’s a nip in the air and the Christmas adverts are on the telly, which means winter is well and truly on its way. And that means it’s time to get the little people’s winter warmers sorted.

You can’t beat a snowsuit for keeping babies and toddlers warm and dry when the temperature drops, but be warned – not all snowsuits are created equal.

If your baby’s not yet walking, you don’t really need a waterproof snowsuit – go for a fleecy pram suit, which will keep immobile little ones cosy when they’re out and about in your arms or in the pushchair.

On the other hand, if your bundle of joy has already taken to his or her feet, you’ll definitely want a snowsuit that’ll keep them dry when they’re splashing in muddy puddles a la Peppa Pig or diving headlong into the cold stuff to make a snow angel.

Keep in mind that most tots aren’t fans of being bundled up in lots of layers, so choose a snowsuit with warm lining to keep little limbs cosy during outdoor play. Avoid anything that leaves them feeling like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters.

And if you’re lucky enough to be heading for the slopes and not just the back garden for some winter fun, choose a snowsuit designed for skiing with reinforced padding on the parts that might get bruised if they take a tumble, and adjustable ankles to fit over snow boots.

Muddy Puddles 3-in-1 Scampsuit: £75, Muddy Puddles

Honestly, it’s difficult to do justice to this gorgeous bit of winter kit. Our favourite feature is the removable inner fleece – what a genius idea.

You can use it on its own for milder days or pop the waterproof layer on top for maximum protection from the elements.

It’s got elasticated cuffs on the wrists and ankles to help keep the snow out, plus snuggly flaps that fold over the feet and hands to keep them extra cosy. And it’s machine washable.

Buy now

Kuling Happy Green Outdoor Verbier Snowsuit: £83, Alex and Alexa

This is so stylish that we’re a bit sad there isn’t a version to fit grownups.

The faux fur hood looks fabulous and it’s detachable – bonus. It’s also got elasticated cuffs and it’ll fit over snow boots if you’re actually heading to the mountains.

We love all the little pockets and the fact that there’s lots of reflective detailing so that little adventurers can be seen easily in the dark.

Buy now

Mini Rodini Pink Ducks Insulator Baby Overalls: £105, Alex and Alexa

We’ve got to admit we giggled when this arrived – the quirky pink duck print is super snazzy but it probably won’t be to everyone’s liking.

It’s made from 100 per cent polyester, apparently recycled, so it’s a good option if you’re of a green persuasion. It’s well padded for extra insulation and we’re big fans of the two zips at the front for quick and easy changes. That’s clever.

It also has a detachable hood and elasticated cuffs which you can fold over to keep little hands and feet extra warm.

Buy now

Frugi Explorer Waterproof All-in-One: £49, Frugi

Adorable. This one’s also made from 100% recycled polyester – it takes 35 plastic bottles to make one of these to fit a tot age 3-4 years! It’s got a soft, recycled fleece lining and the waist and cuffs are elasticated for a cosy fit. There are adjustable, detachable foot stirrups and there’s even a hanging loop so you can hang it out to dry once you’re back inside. We think the prints are super cute and we love that this isn’t too bulky. We got zero protests about putting this one!

Buy now

Marks and Spencer Transport Print Pack Away Snowsuit: £22-24, Marks & Spencer

This is really well padded yet cleverly designed to be easy to pack away, so it’s the perfect choice if you want a snowsuit you can easily pop in your change bag for when the weather turns nasty.

The transport print is really cute and this comes with a hood and booties plus a little storage bag for packing it away.

You wouldn’t want to go rolling in the snow in this but it’s a lovely extra layer for babes in arms or in pushchairs on colder days.

Cold Control Max Down Snowsuit: £49.95, Gap

With down filling and soft fleece lining, this is definitely the snowsuit to go for if you’re expecting sub-zero temperatures.

We love that it’s so cosy yet it’s not at all bulky, so getting it on and off a wriggling tot isn’t a faff.

It has elasticated cuffs and detachable mittens and boots. We braved a freezing cold morning on the beach in this, and the little person in the snowsuit was the only person who didn’t beg to go back indoors.

Dinosaur Fleece Lined All-In-One: £49, JoJo Maman Bebe

Who doesn't want to dress their little one up like a tiny cosy dinousaur!? This is seriously cute, plus they’ve covered everything you need for keeping a little dino warm and cosy when you’re out and about in winter weather.

It’s got reflective strips and turnover cuffs on the arms and legs, plus it’s waterproof and fleece-lined for warmth. And did we mention how cute it is?

Penguin Winter Jumpsuit Bäst-i-Test 2018: £180, Isjborn

This feels like a serious bit of winter weather kit – with a serious price tag to match. We found it kept our little adventurer warm without overheating and it’s not at all bulky.

We like the practical little touches like the rip-stop-like fabric on the knees and bottom, and stirrups to keep the legs from riding up.

If you’re off on a skiing adventure, this is the snowsuit we’d recommend. It’s probably a little OTT for an afternoon in the park on a chilly day, though.

Buy now

Wed'ze Warm Baby Sledging Suit: £21.99, Decathlon

All you need with no frills, at a bargain price. It’s partially fleece lined, and can be washed and tumble dried.

This is just the ticket for taking small people outside on a chilly / snowy day without breaking the bank.

We especially like the adjustable hood as it means you don’t need to spend ages trying to force a hat onto a reluctant little head.

Buy now

Legend Insulated Suit: £145, Helly Hansen

This is similar to the Isbjorn, but with even more bells and whistles. There are lots of clever bits designed for skiing, including the hooky bits so you can take your arms out without the whole thing falling down.

The legs expand to fit over bulky ski boots, and it has adjustable stirrups. This is harder to get on than some of the snowsuits we tried but it’s lightweight yet durable and packs compactly for fitting in a suitcase.

Buy now

Fur Pramsuit: £39, Mamas & Papas

This is essentially a fancy pram suit for keeping a little one cosy on the move. The feet and hands are tucked away, although you can fold the hands back.

It can be washed and tumble dried, which is most excellent since babies and leakages are never far apart.

There are a few really nice touches on this – cute paw prints on the hands, tiny ears on the hood, and the zip is well hidden to stop inquisitive little fingers trying to get this off. The fabric is lovely and soft – highly strokable.

Buy now

Wisti Snowsuit: £145, Miniature

This is another pricey option but you can see where your money is going. It's water resistant and very warm, and the waist is adjustable via two toggles, which are neatly tucked away.

The sleeve ends have nice long cuffs, so you can easily get gloves tucked over the top. The suit folds in at the top, so theres no chin/zip awkwardness, and this one is easy to get on.

The knees and seat have reinforcements incase of tumbles and there are detachable foot straps at the ankles.

Buy now

Mini Club Snowsuit: £28, Boots

From the Fearne Cotton collection, this is a pretty, girlish pattern that’s not overly pink or garish.

The body and hood are lined in fluffy fleece although the arms and legs aren’t so it might be a little less cosy than other options, although that certainly makes it easy to ease little limbs into this.

There are no boots attached but it does come with matching detachable mittens. It’s more of a cosy pram suit than one we’d let a child wear for playing in the snow, but it’s also machine washable, and great value for money.

Buy now

The Verdict: Best baby snowsuits

Easy. The Muddy Puddles 3-in-1 Scampsuit is in a league of its own. It’s stylish yet practical and ticks every snowsuit box we could think of, as well as ones we hadn’t.

We love that it’s essentially two separate suits that can be worn three ways, and we think it’s brilliant value for money when you factor that in.

Some snowsuits are only really wearable on super chilly days but we’ve been wearing this one way or another every day since it arrived. We love it!
